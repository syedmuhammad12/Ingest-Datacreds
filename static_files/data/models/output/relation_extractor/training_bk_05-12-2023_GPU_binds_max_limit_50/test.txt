We describe three cases of newly diagnosed PTB in COVID-19 patients treated at our centre and their clinical and radiological features. The challenges associated with diagnosis and management are also explored. Patient 1 was a case of smear positive, endobronchial tuberculosis incidentally diagnosed due to CT changes, and eventually made good recovery. Patient 2 was a case of COVID-19 who succumbed but was diagnosed posthumously due to a positive sputum culture for tuberculosis. Patient 3 showed radiographic features of PTB and was treated empirically for TB. In conclusion, COVID-19 and PTB coinfection should be suspected in the presence of constitutional symptoms, prior immunocompromised states, prolonged respiratory symptoms or fever, or unresolved radiological abnormalities, more so in regions where TB is endemic.

Article reuse guidelines: sagepub.com/journalspermissions Introduction Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, severe illness associated with antipsychotics. Its clinical manifestations include muscle tonicity, tremor, fever, sympathetic nervous system dysregulation, altered mental status, and elevated creatine kinase (CK).1 Risperidone-induced NMS has been reported, but interestingly, in the case, we observed abnormal elevations of lipase and amylase in addition to the typical clinical presentation. His unique clinical symptoms and interesting pathogenesis are worthy of consideration by clinicians. Case presentation A 35-year-old male was admitted to the hospital for painless fibroscopy to determine the nature of a pulmonary nodule. He had a 10-year history of depression and was taking multiple antipsychotics intermittently. He was not taking antipsychotic medication in the month prior to his admission and sometimes be irritable. Given that he has a bidirectional affective disorder. After consulting with a physician at the mental health centre, we prescribed antipsychotics for the patient, including risperidone (2 mg/day), paroxetine (20 mg/day), and lorazepam (2 mg/ day). After two days, the patient had painless fiberoptic bronchoscopy. During the surgery, sufentanil (8 \u03bcg), isoproterenol (150 mg) and succinylcholine (120 mg) were given as induction of anaesthesia, and the procedure went smoothly. After the surgery, he felt muscle aches and pain, and his limbs were stiff and immobile. During the neurological examination of the patient, we found increased muscle tone in the extremities. No pathological signs or hyperactive tendon reflexes were elicited. Stiffness of the extremities was gradually relieved after approximately two hours. Approximately 24 hours later, the patient developed a high fever and chills with a temperature of 41 \u00b0C. The patient had an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 713 IU/L. Myoglobin (Myo) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also significantly higher than before (Table 1). Subsequently, the patient\u2019s course entered the anuric phase of acute renal failure within 72 hours. No pathogenic bacteria were detected in blood or respiratory secretions. Therefore, we stopped all Risperidone-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a case report Ling Deng , Zhi-Xin Qiu and Mao-Yun Wang Abstract: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare illness that results from reactions to antipsychotics.

Also, we collected the patient\u2019s blood for malignant hyperthermia(MH) susceptibility gene testing. The results showed that the two common MH susceptibility genes, RYR1 and CACNA1 S, were negative. Then, the patient was treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and other treatments to maintain organs function. We also observed abnormally elevated lipase (LIP; up to 2216 IU/L) and amylase (AMY; up to 826 IU/L) in the patient. However, the patient did not present with abdominal pain, and the abdominal CT was normal. We still prohibited the patient from eating and provided parenteral nutrition replacement therapy. After one month, the patient recovered and was restarted on oral clonazepam (3 mg/day) and duloxetine hydrochloride (120 mg/day), and thus far, no adverse reactions have been observed. Discussion NMS is challenging to diagnose and manage. To a large extent, this is because the clinical symptoms are atypical and the pathogenesis is not yet clear. In addition, NMS needs to be distinguished from serotonin syndrome (SS) and malignant hyperthermia (MH). On the basis of the patient\u2019s clinical presentation, we were inclined to diagnose this patient with NMS, but we could not completely rule out a diagnosis of MH. The reasons are as follows. First, the patient was taking risperidone. Risperidone binds to dopamine D2 receptors, resulting in a decrease in dopamine in the body.2 Second, in this relatively hypodopaminergic state, the patient received paroxetine and the opioid sufentanil for general anaesthesia. Both of these drugs will increase the levels of free 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the body.3 Although excess 5-HT in the body may cause serotonin syndrome, the patient never showed paroxysmal or hyperreflexia and therefore did not meet Hunter\u2019s criteria for the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome.4 MH is a genetic disease inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern. The patient\u2019s Clinical Grading Scale (CGS)5 score was 30, which was rated as a \u2018high likelihood of MH\u2019. The patient tested negative for the RYR1 and CACNA1 S mutation loci in the MH susceptibility test. Both the CGS score and the genetic susceptibility test findings suggest that the patient was less likely to have MH. Of course, the \u2018gold standard\u2019 diagnostic test for MH susceptibility is the caffeine-flurane skeletal muscle contraction test.6 Patients with negative genetic results should be offered contracture testing to confirm their MH-negative status. Therefore, the possibility of a diagnosis of MH cannot be completely ruled out in this patient. Table 1. Experimental results in patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

L Deng, Z-X Qiu et al. journals.sagepub.com/home/tpp 3 Acute pancreatitis is one of the rare and serious complications of antipsychotics. Studies reveal that among atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and clozapine are associated with increased chances of induced pancreatitis,7 whereas risperidone is the least likely to cause acute pancreatitis. The duration of acute pancreatitis varies, occurring in most patients within 6 months of the initiation or adjustment of their dose of antipsychotic medication. It has been suggested that the development of acute pancreatitis may be related to the effect of antipsychotic drugs on the metabolism of glucose, triglycerides, insulin and leptin. A study8 found that long-term use of risperidone results in significantly elevated cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar. In addition, genetic polymorphisms can also affect drug metabolism and impact steady-state serum. Furthermore, the use of multiple (2 or more) antipsychotics has been identified as a major contributor to antipsychoticinduced pancreatitis. Conclusion The question we would like to raise through this case is that some other drugs, such as paroxetine and fentanyl, in combination with antidopaminergic drugs, in addition to known antidopaminergic drugs, can exacerbate the occurrence of NMS. In addition to the common clinical manifestations of high fever, psychiatric abnormalities, elevated CK, and renal failure, one needs to be alert for the development of asymptomatic pancreatitis. A better understanding of the etiology and clinical manifestations of NMS was achieved, and the time to initiate treatment was subsequently reduced. This will effectively improve the cure rate for NMS and reduce criticality and mortality.

By definition, it is a clinically and radiologically reversible entity, whose management is basically symptomatic, achieving in most cases the complete reversal of the clinical and radiological alterations1. However, with the increasing diagnosis of the syndrome, there are more and more reports of PRES with unfavorable and irreversible evolution2.  Clinical case A 64-year-old woman, with no relevant past medical history, was initially referred to the Hematology Department of the Virgen de la Luz Hospital in Cuenca for the study of a mass in the left nostril; a biopsy was performed and the anatomical pathology was diagnostic of diffuse, large cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s B lymphoma, stage IE. The mass, of relatively large size, had significant involvement of the paranasal sinuses and orbit, so chemotherapy treatment was started according to the hyper-CVAD scheme (Block 1: cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, dexamethasone) associated with intrathecal chemotherapy (ITT) (methotrexate, cytarabine and glucocorticoid) due to the high risk of meningeal infiltration presented by the proximity of the tumor mass to the central nervous system. The CSF analysis showed no evidence of central nervous system involvement by the lymphoma.  The patient was admitted to the hospital to receive the first part of the hyper-CVAD chemotherapy regimen, from the 13 to the 23 of October of 2020. As complications during admission, she presented severe neutropenia associated with grade III mucositis, so her hospital stay was prolonged.  On day +21 of the cycle, the patient presented spontaneous loss of binocular vision associated with headache. No neurological focalization was evidenced. Associated with this, there was a clinical profile of high blood pressure difficult to control with the oral antihypertensive (irbesartan) prescribed, remaining with a systolic blood pressure of 170-174 mmHg (at admission, over 120 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure in normal figures). Analytically, she only had a slight elevation of leukocytes of 13,200 at the expense of neutrophils, with preserved renal function and elevation of LDH to 902 IU/I with CRP of 20.4 mg/l. She was evaluated by the Ophthalmology Department of the center, ruling out an ocular disease as the initial cause of the symptoms. After that, she was evaluated jointly with the Neurology Department, due to the possibility that it could be an ischemic event favored by her underlying disease.  A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed (Fig. 1A and B) which identified a \u00absignal increase in the subcortical white matter of both occipital lobes and superior regions of the parietal lobes bilaterally, and more or less symmetrically, which did not restrict free water in the diffusion study, in relation to vasogenic edema\u00bb, being this image compatible with a PRES.  Given the diagnosis of PRES, symptomatic treatment was started with labetalol in a perfusion for strict control of the blood pressure, B complex vitamins, dexamethasone, and hyperhydration with physiological saline solution, with which the patient evolved favorably, completely recovering visual acuity three days later, on day +24 of post-chemotherapy.  After the hospital discharge, a control brain MRI was performed, confirming not only the clinical recovery but also the radiological resolution of the clinical profile (table 1).  Discussion The PRES is an increasingly described entity in the medical literature in recent times, probably due to greater access to higher quality imaging tests and greater knowledge of the syndrome, which is why its real incidence has not yet been fully defined.  Despite this progressive diagnostic increase, PRES remains an entity that rarely enters into the usual differential diagnoses; that is why in the case described, the initial diagnostic hypothesis was posterior territory cerebral ischemia within the underlying hematological disease presented by the patient, since hematological disorders have been described as potential risk factors for cerebral ischemia of unusual etiology3.  The pathogenesis of the PRES is not exactly known, although two theories have been proposed to justify it: a vasogenic theory that would explain the syndrome as a consequence of an acute increase in blood pressure that would override cerebral blood pressure autoregulation, leading to vasodilatation and non-cell autonomous endothelial injury; and on the other hand, a cytotoxic theory, which would advocate the existence of a direct toxic effect on the endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature, resulting in cell autonomous endothelial dysfunction. Whatever the initial cause, in both cases, the end result is the diffusion of proteins and plasma cells into the extracellular space with consequent secondary cerebral edema4,5.  Both theories could be applied to the development of PRES in the patient we describe, since, as can be seen in \ufb01gure 2, there is a clear association of the onset of symptoms with the increase in blood pressure, but also with another important etiological factor, toxicity caused by the chemotherapy treatment.  Since it was first described in 1996 by Hinchey et al., several cases and case series have been reported in an attempt to identify the clinical characteristics that could condition the onset of this condition, with high blood pressure (HBP) being the most frequently described risk factor, followed by cytotoxic and immunosuppressive medication, pre(eclampsia), sepsis, kidney disease, autoimmune diseases, and solid organ and bone marrow transplantation1. It has also been associated with endocrine dysfunction, hypercalcemia, hypomagnesemia and hyperparathyroidism, among others6. Recently, it has also been described in patients with COVID-197. Thus, the PRES appears to be a common final pathway to different diseases.  There are increasing reports linking the PRES to hematological diseases, such as diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, among others8, and also, to some treatments such as GCSF or chemotherapy, both in monotherapy and in combination, although a clear association with a specific chemotherapeutic agent has not been achieved4.  In our case, the hyper-CVAD treatment scheme was used, a scheme with which the appearance of this syndrome has not been described to date, although it has been associated with other regimens with which it shares components, such as the CHOP/R-CHOP9 scheme, DA-EPOCH+-R9, gemcitabine4, and treatments with intrathecal methotrexate10. As can be seen in most of these regimens, the common denominator is cyclophosphamide, which has been associated with several cases of PRES, as well as gemcitabine.  In this line, we present a case of a patient with multiple risk factors for developing PRES: hematologic disease, chemotherapy treatment and an abrupt elevation of blood pressure during admission, making it difficult to define a single precipitating factor. As already mentioned, the PRES has been related to electrolyte alterations, such as hypomagnesemia or hypercalcemia, and alterations in renal function, and some more nonspecific ones, such as elevated LDH and CRP5. In this case, the former were at normal values, while the latter, despite presenting elevated figures, could not be directly associated with the syndrome, given the history of chemotherapy and the previous complication.  The management of PRES will be based fundamentally on the control of the multiple risk factors and the suspension of the treatment that may be causing it5. The patient described had already completed the first block of the chemotherapy cycle containing cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone and ITT, so management was based on strict control of blood pressure, administration of dexamethasone to reduce vasogenic edema, hyperhydration and B vitamins, achieving complete clinical and radiological improvement. Thus, as previously mentioned, we could attribute the etiology of the condition to both factors (both HBP and chemotherapy).  Although there is consensus on the elimination of the etiological triggering factor, something relatively simple when we are in a context of high blood pressure, this can be more complicated in PRES induced by cytotoxic drugs, immunosuppressants or chemotherapy, in which their withdrawal remains a challenging issue, and which requires a decision on an individual basis, assessing the risks and benefits of their withdrawal, since there are cases in which the symptoms resolve while the medication is maintained. In the case of withdrawal of these drugs, it is not known whether it should be done permanently or only for a period of time, in which case the duration of the interruption would not be defined either, which is why it is useful to report cases and follow up on them3.  Conclusion The PRES syndrome is a relatively poorly described entity, although it has become progressively better known in recent years. We present a case of PRES in a patient being treated with hyper-CVAD, which until now had not been described in the medical literature, associated with other risk factors, without being able to identify the exact precipitating cause: high blood pressure, chemotherapy or both, but whose elimination allowed the resolution of the condition; a condition increasingly described in recent years and which needs to continue to be reported and studied to gain more knowledge about it and its management.

Only 23 cases of PCNS ENK/TCL have been reported in the English literature. Due to the rarity of this lymphoma, an effective therapeutic strategy has not been defined. Generally, this type of lymphoma is treated with surgery, intrathecal chemotherapy, and postoperative chemoradiation therapy. The prognosis is poor. Herein, we present a case of primary brain NK/T cell lymphoma in a 50-year-old immuno\u00ad competent Chinese female and review the literature. The patient underwent intracranial tumor resection and was subsequently treated with a PD1 monoclonal antibody (Sintilimab) combined with chemotherapy. The patient survived 15 months after diagnosis. This is the first report of PCNS ENK/TCL treated with surgery and chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy and suggests an effective treatment regimen for PCNS ENK/TCL. Keywords: primary central nervous system, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, PD1  Introduction Primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) are aggressive non-Hodgkin extranodal lymphoma that originate from the brain parenchyma, meninges, spinal cord, or eyes excluding systemic disease; It represents 4% to 6% of all extranodal lymphomas and only 4% of all intracranial neoplasms.1,2 Among primary CNS lymphomas, more than 90% of PCNSLs are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in immunocompetent patients,3 and less than 5% are T-cell lymphoma.2 Extranodal Natural Killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENK/TCL) originates from NK cells or cytotoxic T cells and is an aggressive lymphoma. ENK/TCL is usually related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and is characterized by a cytotoxic phenotype, vascular damage, and prominent necrosis.4 ENK/TCL is more commonly in Asia and South America. Lesions occur mostly in the nasal cavity and the midline structure of the face. It was previously known as lethal midline granuloma.5 However, it can also occur in the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, soft tissue, and testes.4 Conversely, the central nervous system is rarely involved as the initial site for ENK/TCL lesions. Extranodal NK/TCL of the primary central nervous system (PCNS) is extremely rare.

Herein, we present a case of PCNS ENK/TCL in a 50year-old immunocompetent Chinese female and review of the literature.  Case Presentation A 50-year-old Chinese female presented with worsening vision loss in the right eye and weakness in both lower limbs for approximately 11 months, She also reported headache, no fever, night sweats, dizziness, and vomiting. She had normal vision in the left eye and had a history of hypertension and ectopic pregnancy. The patient also had a history of cholecystectomy and right breast cyst surgery. There was no other relevant family and personal medical history. Physical examination revealed that the patient was conscious, spoke clearly, with the tongue in the middle position. The bilateral frontal lines and the nasolabial groove were symmetrical. The bilateral pupils were equally large and round, with a diameter of 3 mm. The patient\u2019s left and right visual acuity was 1.0 and 0.1, respectively. The intraocular pressure on both sides was 16 mmHg. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed that revealed a mass located in the left frontal lobe with a large cross section of 4.3\u00d73.2 cm (Figure 1A\u2013F). The lesion exhibited slightly longer T1 and slightly longer T2 signals, with internal density that was not uniform (Figure 1A\u2013F). Due to the mass effect, the midline structure and the left ventricle were compressed and shifted to the right (Figure 1C). The MRI revealed that the upper margin of the intracranial segment of the left optic nerve was closely associated with the intracranial tumor, while no obvious abnormality was observed in the right optic nerve (Figure 1D). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain showed an increased choline peak and a suppressed N-acetylaspartate peak (Figure 2). The patient underwent intracranial tumor resection. The tumor was yellowishwhite in color, hard in texture, without capsule, and had a rich in blood supply, with significant surrounding edema. The histological examination revealed that the brain par\u00ad enchyma was diffusely infiltrated by atypical lymphocytes and showed extensive necrosis (Figure 3A). The tumor cells were of medium size with irregularly folded nuclei and indistinct nucleoli. The cytoplasm was moderate and mitotic figures were easily identified (Figure 3B). The  2  Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)  https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S343400  DovePress  tumor cells presented an angiocentric (Figure 3C) and angiodestructive growth pattern (Figure 3D). The EnVision method was applied for immunohistochemical staining,25 and revealed that the tumor cells were positive for CD3 (Figure 3E), CD4 (Figure 3F), CD7, and CD8. The NK cell marker CD56 was partially positive (Figure 3G). PD1 was weakly positive (Figure 3M) and PD-L1 was positive (Figure 3N); however, B cell markers, including CD20 (Figure 3H) and CD79a, were negative. In addition, cytotoxic markers such as granzyme B (Figure 3I) and TIA-1 (Figure 3J) were also positive for tumor cells. The Ki-67 proliferation index was positive in about 80% of tumor cells (Figure 3K). Additionally, tumor cells were positive for Vim, LCA, and negative for CD30, CK, S100, Syn, GFAP, olig-2, ALKp80, and EMA. Small RNAs encoded by EBV (EBERs) were detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) in the nucleus of lymphoma cells (Figure 3L). Through histopathological analysis, the diagnosis of ENK/TCL was established. Subsequent laboratory tests revealed that platelets, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell count were all within the reference range. The results of the blood biochemical examination were normal. Syphilis serologies, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus were all negative. The patient was immu\u00ad nocompetent and HIV negative. The erythrocyte sedimen\u00ad tation rate (ESR) was elevated at 82 mm/hour (normal range 0\u201320 mm/hour). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis was positive for EBV DNA (5.96\u00d7102 copies/mL) in peripheral blood. The lympho\u00ad cyte subsets showed a decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio and B lymphocytes (CD3-CD19+). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an elevated white blood cell count (53\u00d7106/L, normal range 0\u20135\u00d7106/L), with pleocy\u00ad tosis (54\u00d7106/L, normal range 0\u20138\u00d7106/L) and slightly elevated protein (628.6 mg/L, normal range 150\u2013450 mg/ L). The CSF cytologic examination was negative for neo\u00ad plastic cells, and flow cytometry immunophenotyping ana\u00ad lysis was normal. The real-time qPCR analysis of the CSF was negative for EBV DNA. A bone marrow biopsy, bone marrow smear, and bone marrow flow cytometry immu\u00ad nophenotyping analysis was negative for lymphomatous involvement. The whole-body positron emission photogra\u00ad phy/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed that the left frontal lobe foci showed postoperative changes with sparse fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, but no foci of increased uptake elsewhere in the body (Figure 4). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan after surgery and before chemotherapy revealed a residual cavity was  OncoTargets and Therapy 2022:15  \fDovepress  Qin et al  Figure 1 MRI images of the patient. (A\u2013F) Preoperative MRI examination revealed slightly longer T1 and slightly longer T2 signals of the lesion (arrows).

No abnormal signal areas and abnormal enhancement foci were observed in other brain parenchyma (Figure 1G\u2013J). From the combined radiological and clinicopathological analysis, the patient was diagnosed with PCNS ENK/ TCL. The patient underwent six cycles of PD1 monoclonal antibody (Sintilimab) and high-dose methotrexate and pegaspargase and thiotepa chemotherapy regimen (Sintilimab 200 mg, methotrexate 3.5 g/m2, pegaspargase 2000 IU/m2, thiotepa 30 mg/m2) plus an intrathecal meth\u00ad otrexate (15 mg) and cytarabine (50 mg) and dexametha\u00ad sone (5 mg) in the first two cycles. After treatment, her right eye visual acuity recovered. The subsequent MRI obtained 8 months later revealed the extent of abnormal enhancement foci and the residual cavity in the left frontal lobe was smaller than before (Figure 1K\u2013N). The EBV DNA from peripheral blood returned to normal after  4  Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)  https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S343400  DovePress  treatment. The main adverse events during treatment were hematologic toxicity: grade 1 neutropenia, grade 3 anemia, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The efficacy was evaluated as complete response and the patient remained alive 15 months after her diagnosis. For subsequent treat\u00ad ment, we planned to use Sintilimab as maintenance ther\u00ad apy, but the patient refused further treatment.  Discussion PCNSL is confined to the brain parenchyma, eyes, spinal cord, or meninges, with no evidence of systemic involve\u00ad ment at the time of diagnosis. PCNSL is a specific form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and represents 4% to 6% of all extranodal lymphomas,26 and only 4% of all intracranial neoplasms.2 Among primary CNS lymphomas, more than 90% are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).3 PCNS ENK/TCL is distinctly rare, with only 23 cases reported in the English literature so far. Among these cases, aggres\u00ad sive clinical behavior and a rapid progressive clinical course were reported, and patients have a poorer prognosis   than extracranial NK/TCL.6\u201324 PCNSLs are often accom\u00ad panied by nonspecific clinical symptoms such as dizziness, headache, vomiting, and blurred vision. Our patient pre\u00ad sented with loss of visual acuity and weakness of the limbs, which were consistent with the nonspecific symp\u00ad toms of primary CNS lymphoma. Morphologically, NK/ TCL shows obvious necrosis and angiodestructive growth pattern, and there was diffuse lymphocyte infiltration. The morphology of tumor cells varies greatly. The typical immunophenotype of NK/TCL is cytoplasmic CD3+, CD56+, EBER+, and cytotoxic markers (perforin, gran\u00ad zyme B, and TIA-1) are positive.27 Recently, research showed that most NK/T cell lymphoma were from the T cell lineage, and half lacked expression of TCR   protein.28 The rearrangement of the TCR gene is an impor\u00ad tant diagnostic molecular marker for this lymphoma. We report a case of PCNS ENK/TCL in a 50-year-old immunocompetent Chinese female. To our knowledge, this is the first case of this tumor treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Furthermore, we checked the protein expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) by immunohistochemistry (Figure 3M and N). The description of this case will contribute to a better understanding of this rare type of lymphoma and accumulate more clinical and pathological data.

According to previously reported cases, overall survival in patients with PCNS ENK/TCL is not high. The highest survival reported was 139 months to date, and the median overall survival was 6 months.6\u201324 There were nineteen immunocompetent (IC) cases and two immunosuppressive (IS) cases of which one was infected with HIV and the another was a posttransplant patient. Most of the patients were from Asia, Africa, and Spain, and the age of these patients was between 13 and 77 years (median, 53 years). There were 13 males and 10 females, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. In terms of IC cases, age ranged between 13 and 77 years (median, 54 years), with 10 males and 9 females. The lesions of all reported cases were restricted to the CNS; however, the tumor was broadly distributed throughout the CNS, includ\u00ad ing the brain parenchyma, orbital, meninges, spinal cord and pituitary gland, cauda equina, indicating that there was no predilection site. The locations of previously reported cases of PCNS ENK/TCL are summarized in Table 1. Most cases were diagnosed by surgical resection, includ\u00ad ing the case reported herein. Among all reported cases, treatment information was available for eighteen patients. All these patients received different treatments: seven underwent surgical excision, twelve underwent MTX che\u00ad motherapy, and twelve received radiotherapy. Although most cases received combination treatment, some patients received radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone, while none of the patients received surgical intervention alone. However, the case we reported was treated with surgical excision, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. For all patients, the prognosis was poor as shown in Table 1, with the overall survival of the IC cases being 1\u201329 months (median, 7 months). Histologically, they showed vascular damage and necrosis accompanied by vascularcentered infiltration. Expression of various markers included CD3 (20/21); CD56 (15/20); CD5 (1/8); CD45 (6/6); cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1/granzyme B/perforin) (12/12), and EBER (18/18). T cell clonality was detected in 42% (5/12) of the cases examined. Some of the included cases revealed that the majority of NK/T-cell lymphoma were of the T-cell lineage, and half lacked TCR protein expression.28 In our case, immunohistochemical staining showed the tumor cells were positive for CD3, CD4, TIA1, granzyme B, CD56 and were negative for CD20. In addition, PD1 was weakly positive and PD-L1 was  OncoTargets and Therapy 2022:15  Qin et al  positive. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) were detected in the nucleus of lymphoma cells. However, T-cell clonality was not evaluated in our case. Due to the rarity of this lymphoma, an effective ther\u00ad apeutic strategy has not been established. Generally, this lymphoma is treated by surgery, intrathecal chemotherapy, and postoperative chemoradiation therapy. Currently, the standardized therapeutic strategy for CNS lymphoma includes radiation therapy and high-dose MTX.29 The use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in PCNSL treat\u00ad ment is controversial, especially in patients over 60 years of age, due to its limited efficacy and late-onset neurotoxicity.1 In our case, the patient underwent surgical excision and was received six cycles of PD1 monoclonal antibody (Sintilimab), high-dose methotrexate, pegaspar\u00ad gase, thiotepa chemotherapy regimen plus intrathecal che\u00ad motherapy. The patient tolerated the treatment well and continued to show radiographical and clinical improve\u00ad ments, although her outcome is not known. Considering the patient\u2019s good response to chemotherapy and the delayed neurotoxicity of WBRT, WBRT was not consid\u00ad ered. Due to the short survival period of standard treatment and the highly aggressive course of this tumor, some clin\u00ad icians recommend bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation to consolidate.29 Nonetheless, there are no reliable data for NK/T-cell lymphoma, and this treatment strategy is usually used for the treatment of B-cell lym\u00ad phoma. Due to the difficulty in performing clinical trials for PCNS ENK/T-cell lymphoma, there is still a lack of standardized treatments. Some studies have reported the overexpression of the PD-L1 protein in ENK/TCL by immunohistochemistry,30\u201332 and refractory NK/T-cell lym\u00ad phoma with PD-L1 overexpression was sensitive to antiPD1 antibody treatment.33 One possible mechanism for NK/T-cell lymphoma to escape effector T cell immune targeting is to suppress antitumor immunity by PD1 liga\u00ad tion with PD-L1. Blocking the PD1/PD-L1 signaling path\u00ad way with anti-PD1 antibody can restore effector T cells targeting NK/T-cell lymphoma cells, which is a potential therapeutic strategy. A study carried out in Asian countries that included seven patients who were refractory or relapsed after the SMILE chemotherapy regimen under\u00ad went a median of seven cycles of a single agent, pembro\u00ad lizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody), and reported that two patients achieved a partial response (PR), and five patients achieved a complete response (CR). The objective response rate (ORR) was 100%.33 Two independent studies demonstrated that three patients with refractory or relapsed  https://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S343400  DovePress  Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)  9  \fDovepress  Qin et al  ENK/TCL achieved a CR after therapy with pembrolizumab.34,35 Another study reported that three cases with refractory or relapsed ENK/TCL achieved a clinical response with low-dose nivolumab (an anti-PD -1 antibody).36 A pilot study showed that nivolumab achieved objective clinical and radiographic responses in four patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL and one sec\u00ad ondary CNS lymphoma, including four CR and one PR.37 These results indicated that anti-PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody may be an effective treatment for PCNS ENK/ TCL. In our case, we verified the expression of PD1 and PD-L1 and revealed that PD1 was weakly positive (Figure 3M) and PD-L1 was positive (Figure 3N). Therefore, for this patient, we chose a chemotherapy regi\u00ad men containing the PD1 monoclonal antibody (Sintilimab). Our patient\u2019s good outcome may also be attributed to the reduction of the tumor mass by resection before high-dose MTX, which may have enhanced the antitumor efficacy of MTX, while the surgical disruption of the blood-brain barrier may have resulting in increasing doses of drug entering the brain. However, our case report still has cer\u00ad tain limitations due to the lack of molecular profiling, which may be important to determine responses to PD-1 immunotherapy in NK/TCL.38  Conclusion We report a new case of PCNS ENK/TCL in a 50-year-old immunocompetent Chinese female, and summarized the clinicopathological features of previously reported cases. Although most of primary CNS lymphoma are B-cell lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma also do occur. Therefore, NK/T-cell lymphoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma, and excluding direct invasion of extracranial NK/T-cell lym\u00ad phoma. Surgery and chemotherapy combined with immu\u00ad notherapy may be an effective strategy for the treatment of PCNS ENK/TCL. Further studies are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of this treatment strategy.

{"document": " What became of the first patient treated with carfilzomib in F\u00fcrstenfeld?  29. November 2022  Paid Advert This article presents the case of a male patient who was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2012 and whose condition quickly became refractory to therapy. Deep remission was achieved with fourth-line therapy using the KRd regimen with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib available since 2015. Today, ten years after the initial diagnosis, the patient is doing very well.   02/2012: A 56-year-old male patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in February of 2012. At the time of the diagnosis, a 30-40% infiltration of bone marrow obtained by iliac crest biopsy, elevated immunoglobulins (IgG: 3,707 mg/dl) and lambda FLCs (272 mg/l), as well as a total protein level of 9.3 mg/dl, albumin: 4.2 g/dl, \u00df2-microglobulin: 5.49 mg/l were observed. There was no osteolysis and the patient did not suffer from end organ damage; thus, stage I multiple myeloma according to Salmon and Durie, ISS stage II, was diagnosed. Due to lack of indication for treatment, monitoring was initiated.   Preexisting conditions: Secondary sclerosing cholangitis after several weeks of being hospitalized in the intensive care unit was a known comorbidity. In March of 2011, the patient had suffered from severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with an H1N1 swine flu infection. He had required a respirator and finally had to be placed on an ECMO machine. In addition, intermittent acute kidney failure requiring dialysis occurred in the context of this stay.   Two years later, progression - induction therapy 02/2014: Two years later, the myeloma had progressed: Bone marrow infiltration was now at 60%, total protein: 12.7 g/dl, IgG: 5,132 mg/dl, marked increase in free light chains (lambda FLCs: 814 mg/dl); osteolysis was still not observed in imaging procedures.   03/2014: In March of 2014, induction therapy according to the PAD regimen (bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone) was initiated over four cycles.   06/2014: Bone marrow infiltration was still 60-70%, with the condition being largely unchanged serologically, as IgG had increased minimally in the meantime and increased again in August of 2014.   After the induction therapy 07/2014: Thus, response to the induction therapy was lacking, and the patient, who was psychologically stressed, requested for the therapy to be paused. He also rejected stem cell apheresis in preparation of an autologous stem cell transplantation.   Second-line therapy 08/2014 - 01/2015: After a brief pause, the patient was once again ready to continue treatment. Therapy with lenalidomide/dexamethasone was thus initiated; however, the patient complained of persistent fatigue. The response was minimal (M spike only minimally reduced from 4.74 g/dl to 3.17 g/dl, IgG reduced slightly from 6.121 mg/dl to 5.641 mg/dl); after the fifth cycle, bone marrow infiltration was 50% and was thus also only slightly reduced. Therapy was therefore discontinued in January of 2015. As early as two months later, the disease had once again progressed, as reflected by a compression fracture of T12, which required radiation therapy.   Third-line therapy 04/2015 - 09/2015: The patient now received third-line therapy by means of four cycles of bortezomib/bendamustine/Aprednisolon, followed by two cycles of bortezomib/dexamethasone. The response was again minimal, with bone marrow infiltration decreasing to about 40% and IgG remaining at 4,973 mg/dl, as well as total protein at 10.4 g/dl. \u2003 ASCT planning \u2014 stem cell apheresis The patient was now willing to undergo stem cell apheresis after all, so that cyclophosphamide priming was conducted in 10/2015. Unfortunately, only a few cells could be harvested, despite addition of plerixafor, and ASCT was therefore not an option.   Fourth-line therapy Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone 29. 12. 2015: As of December of 2015, carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was authorized and available for the treatment of relapsed/refractory myeloma, so that the patient was the first to be offered this option in our clinic.  Rapid response was observed; as early as after two cycles of KRd, the total protein decreased from 11.4 g/dl to 7 g/dl, the M spike decreased from 4.4 g/dl to 0.92 g/dl, consistent with partial remission. Bone marrow biopsy after four cycles only showed 10% residual infiltration of the bone marrow by the multiple myeloma. KRd was administered for a total of 12 cycles and was very well tolerated. The therapy was then discontinued per the patient\u2019s wishes. During the entire therapy, first zoledronic acid and then XGEVA\u00ae since August 2018 were coadministered.

As part of this follow-up visit, the myeloma-specific serological parameters were determined as well. The blood count and kidney function parameters were normal, calcium was within the reference range, total protein at 7.4 g/dl, the M spike was 1.8 g/dl, and osteolysis was still not observed in imaging procedures. Therapy is thus still not indicated, and we will continue to monitor. Should the need for treatment arise, a combination of an anti-CD38 antibody with carfilzomib and dexamethasone would be the initial approach.   Summary: Carfilzomib demonstrates excellent response, even in refractory myeloma. While KRd was only available as late-line therapy in 2015, current study data clearly support the use of carfilzomib combined with an anti-CD38 antibody in treating the first relapse. The patient has now been living with his disease for more than ten years, the last five of which were treatment-free. The lack of or only minor response to prior therapies is surely remarkable in this case. Carfilzomib was well tolerated over 12 cycles and, unlike the prior therapies, KRd was able to achieve deep remission for the first time. Side effects of carfilzomib are easily managed. Even preexisting cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, should not be an exclusion criterion for carfilzomib therapy. These patients can still be managed well by adjusting the dosage or dosing interval and optimizing drug therapy for hypertension and heart failure while monitoring them regularly.

Description We describe the case of a 44- year-old man with no comorbidities who underwent two uneventful general anaesthetics (GAs) in a 2-week interval: the first for cystourethroscopy and insertion of a ureteric stent and the second for stent removal. After the first surgery, the patient reported hiccups that commenced shortly after his procedure and persisted for 3 days before resolving spontaneously. On the second occasion, he experienced persistent hiccups for 10 days despite early therapeutic management. Discussion Mechanisms of perioperative hiccups are not well known; however, persistent hiccups after two GA exposures suggest common precipitating factors. The incidence of hiccups with propofol is described as being < 1% [1]. At first, the patient received volatile maintenance anaesthesia after propofol induction, whereas on the second occasion, total intravenous anaesthesia was employed. We note that an increased total dose of propofol administered was associated with an increased duration of hiccups, suggesting a dosedependent rather than an 'all or nothing' association. Subsequent 'propofol-free' anaesthesia may help to isolate propofol as a precipitant in this case. High-dose dexamethasone has been described as a trigger for hiccups, possibly via direct simulation of the hiccup reflex arc. The literature describes a male preponderance, a 75% recurrence rate on re-administration and a dose-dependent association seen with a median dose of 10 mg [2]. This patient received 8 mg dexamethasone as anti-emetic prophylaxis on both occasions, which may have been an inciting factor. Use of a regional anaesthetic technique may theoretically help determine whether the surgical stimulus itself or administered medication was the precipitating factor. It should be noted however, that hiccups have also been described after spinal anaesthesia. This patient received oral chlorpromazine, commenced on the sixth postoperative day. There is currently no published data available describing the efficacy of pre-medication for prevention of hiccups. Given the paucity of data, we propose full discussion with such patients about potential causes and sequential exclusion of possible precipitants to yield an anaesthetic technique that eliminates this distressing side effect.

On hospital day 2 the patient\u2019s headache, diffuse body pain, spasticity, paresthesias improved. The patient was discharged on hospital day 4 with baseline neurologic exam and near resolution of symptoms. Discussion: Our patient developed encephalopathy like other toxic IT overdoses. There is limited published experience with IT AmBd overdose and patients can experience significant toxicity with routine therapeutic administration. Due to the lack of published experience this overdose was treated as a potentially lifethreatening exposure. Ommaya reservoir CSF exchange was initially attempted to limit further drug exposure. AmBd is highly lipophilic, which may have limited the effectiveness of CSF exchange relative to better established indications such as IT doxorubicin or methotrexate overdoses, which both have low lipophilicity. It is possible that a majority of AmBd had already peripherally distributed after 8 h and thus CSF exchange was not repeated. The patient was also administered parental corticosteroids to treat inflammation. It is unclear if the CSF exchange and/or corticosteroids limited toxicity or hastened recovery; it is possible that we simply observed the natural course of toxicity. Conclusions: Intrathecal amphotericin B deoxycholate overdoses remains a rare and scantly reported toxicity. Toxic encephalopathy may result after overdose. Until further research is performed it is reasonable to pursue CSF exchange to limit drug absorption and to administer parenteral corticosteroids.

National estimates of antidepressant-related poison center calls Saumitra Rege, Will Goodrich and Christopher Holstege University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA Background: Approximately 92,000 persons in the US died from drug-involved overdose in 2020. Estimated rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among adults have increased in recent years. According to a recent study, more than 20 million antidepressants were prescribed between October and December 2020. The objective of our study was to evaluate the trends in antidepressant- related calls to the US poison centers (PCs). Methods: The National Poison Data System (NPDS) was queried for all closed, human exposures to antidepressants from January 01, 2015 through December 31, 2021 using the American Association of Poison Control Center (AAPCC) generic code identifiers. We identified and descriptively assessed the relevant demographic and clinical characteristics. Reports from acute care hospitals and hospital based EDs (ACHs) were evaluated as a subset. Trends in antidepressant frequencies and rates (per 100,000 human exposures) were analyzed using Poisson regression methods. Percent changes from the first year of the study (2014) were reported with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: During the study period, there were 836,045 toxic exposures to antidepressants that were reported to the PCs. The frequency of exposures increased by 20.3% (95% CI: 16.1%, 23.9%; p<0.001), and the rate of exposures decreased by 22.3% (95% CI: 17.8%, 25.9%; p<0.001). Of the total antidepressant calls, the proportion of calls from ACHs decreased from 38.3% to 34.8%, while the percentage of calls from the general public increased. Multiple substance exposures accounted for 52.4% of the overall antidepressant calls and 56% of calls from ACHs. Approximately 18% of the patients with reported antidepressant exposures were admitted to a critical care unit (CCU), with 17% of patients admitted to a psychiatric facility. Residence was the most common site of exposure (93.8%), and 67% of these cases were enroute to the hospital via EMS when the PC was notified. Cases were predominantly female (65.3%), with the most common age group being 20\u201329 years (14.9%). The proportion of such cases (28.7\u201334.1%) increased during the study period. Suspected suicides (57.2%) were the most common reason for exposure, with the proportions of suspected suicides being higher in cases reported by ACH (12.1% vs 14.9%). During the study period, the proportion of reported antidepressant exposures due to therapeutic errors increased (18.5\u201322.3%), while suspected suicides decreased (58.6\u201354.2%). Major effects were seen in 8.2% cases and case fatality rate was 0.3%, with 169 fatalities reported for single substance antidepressant exposures. The most frequently co-occurring substances associated with the cases were alcohol (12%) and marijuana (9.7%). Tachycardia (42.8%) and agitation (35.5%) were commonly observed clinical effects. Conclusions: Our study results demonstrate a significant increase in the reports of antidepressant exposures made to the PCs. Exposures in young age groups were common and the most frequent reason for exposure were suspected suicides. Continued surveillance and public health prevention efforts are key to track the population effects of antidepressant exposures.

Don\u2019t let metformin toxicity fall into the knowledge gap: a case series of patients with elevated osmolar gap in the setting of metformin toxicity Carin Malley, William Trautman, Alek Adkins, Matthew Scanlon, Anthony Pizon and Joseph Yanta University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Background: Osmolar gap is a commonly employed screening tool for toxic alcohol ingestion largely due to the relative scarcity of gas chromatography needed to measure quantitative serum levels of methanol and ethylene glycol. The positive and negative predictive values of serum osmol gap for toxic alcohols are poor, especially when a value of 10 mOsm/L is used as the upper limit of normal. However, many non-toxicologists do not appreciate the diagnostic limitations and broad differential that remains after an elevated osmolar gap is identified. This can lead to mismanagement of patients. In this case series we present three cases with osmolar gap >30 mOsm/L in the setting of metformin associated metabolic acidosis (MAMA) and in the absence of toxic alcohol exposure. Case series: We present a series of three patients evaluated at a tertiary care center with MAMA and osmolar gaps >30 mOsm/L in the absence of toxic alcohol exposure. Diagnosis of MAMA was made by board certified medical toxicologists based on presentation with severe metabolic acidosis, lactate elevation, and metformin exposure with factors that would decrease metformin elimination. In cases #1 and #3, diagnosis was confirmed with quantitative serum metformin levels of 38mcg/mL and 470mcg/ mL, respectively. Metformin level was not available in case #2. All three patients had a pH <6.9 and lactate >15mMol/L. In cases #1 and #2, the mechanism of metformin accumulation was continued therapeutic metformin doses in the setting of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) with presenting creatinine of 11 and 15.32mg/dL, respectively. In case #3, the patient presented soon after an acute ingestion of 90gm of metformin and 60 tablets of 142 ABSTRACT acetaminophen-diphenhydramine combination product. By the time case #3 was transferred to the tertiary care center 3 h later, she was anuric. Osmolar gap was calculated using the standard equation [(2\u0007Na)\u00fe(BUN/2.8) \u00fe glucose/18)]. Ethanol was negative in all three cases. Osmolar gap was calculated at 39.8, 46, and 34.8 mOsm/kg for patients #1, #2, and #3, respectively. Methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol were ruled out by serum gas chromatography for patients #1 and #2 and by history and collateral information in patient #3. All three were treated with continuous hemodialysis (HD) for 10.75 h, 13 h, and 47.75 h respectively until serum lactate levels were <3mMol/L in accordance with EXTRIP guidelines. Discussion: While previous literature has documented that a lactate elevation is associated with an elevated osmolar gap of approximately 10.3mmol/kg, there has only been one other reported case of elevated osmolar gap in the setting of MAMA. That previous case documented an osmolar gap of 20 mOsm/kg. Our series is the first to document multiple confirmed cases of MAMA with a serum osmolar gap >30 mOsm/kg. Conclusions: Patients with MAMA can develop an osmolar gap of >30 mOsm/kg. MAMA is a life threatening and treatable condition that should be a part of the complete differential diagnosis of the critically ill patient with an elevated osmolar gap, profound acidosis and elevated lactate.

Breaking the heart and breaking the blood: a case series of cutaneoushemolytic loxoscelism with cardiac involvement Rebecca Bruccoleria, Samuel Littlejohnb, Christopher Hendersonb, Jeffrey Weinerb, Adam Skaffb and Saralyn Williamsb aTennessee Poison Center, Nashville, TN, USA; bVanderbilt Children\u2019s Hospital, Nashville, TN, USA Background: Brown recluse envenomations may range from localized necrotic skin lesions to systemic illness with serious complications including rapid hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Myocarditis has rarely been reported. Case series: Case 1: 12 y/o girl presented to the ED with 2 days of fever, malaise, sore throat, and rash on the left arm after a stay at an outdoor summer camp where loxosceles reclusa are endemic. She was tachycardic and febrile, with a 1-cm black bulla on her proximal left arm with surrounding erythema to distal arm. Her HCT was 41.1% and she was admitted for treatment of cellulitis and concern for sepsis or toxic shock syndrome. On hospital day (HD) 5, transthoracic echo (TTE) showed hyperdynamic wall motion. She was transferred to a referral hospital on HD 6 where she was afebrile but tachycardic and tachypneic. Physical exam showed diffuse erythroderma and pustulosis with a 2cm \u00073 cm black eschar at the site of the previously noted bulla. Her CRP was 149.4mg/L, ESR >145mm/h, Hct 13%, troponin- I 0.20 ng/mL (normal <0.03), BNP 856 pg/mL (normal <100), lactate 12mmol/L (normal 0.5\u20132.02 mmol/L). ECG showed sinus tachycardia. She was given 1 unit pRBCs and admitted for cutaneous- hemolytic loxoscelism. On HD 7, she developed respiratory failure requiring intubation. Subsequent TTE showed mild-tomoderately depressed LV function and mildly depressed RV function. Troponin peaked at 0.83 ng/mL. TTE 2 days later showed normal wall motion. She was extubated after 5 days. She required a total of 7u pRBCs. She was discharged on HD 15 and followed in toxicology clinic. Her wound exhibited good healing until she was lost to follow-up \u00062 months after discharge. Case 2: 15 y/o girl presented with a \u00062 cm \u00071.5 cm necrotic lesion to her right medial calf with surrounding induration and erythema. She first noticed the lesion 5 days prior to admission and rash on her arms the following day. Review of relevant systems was otherwise negative. Exam revealed tachycardia, no conjunctival pallor, the lesion noted above, and a blanching, macular rash to arms, abdomen, and legs, suggestive of systemic loxoscelism. Initial HCT was 35% and CRP was 87.9 mg/L. She was admitted for serial HCT and UA monitoring. Overnight between HD 1 and 2, she developed vomiting, and the following morning, substernal chest pain with burning. Her ECG showed 0.5\u20131mm ST elevation in V4-V6 diagnosed as early repolarization. Her troponin was 3.52 ng/mL which peaked at 3.83 ng/mL and normalized after 5 days. TTE was normal for age. Her HCT fell to 26 on HD 2 and to 21 on HD 3, she received 2 units of pRBCs. Repeat HCT was 33 and no further pRBCs required. She was discharged on HD 6 and followed in toxicology clinic. In outpatient cardiology clinic, there was concern that patient had myocarditis, but she did not require follow up, given resolution of symptoms and normal troponin. An ECG \u00062 months later was normal without ST elevation. Discussion: There are rare reports of myocarditis associated with loxosceles envenomations. A murine model has demonstrated binding and injury of the myocardium from Loxosceles intermedia venom. Previous reports of rhabdomyolysis did not always exclude myocardial injury as the cause of the elevated creatine kinase. Conclusions: These two cases demonstrate the possibility of myocardial involvement with acute loxoscelism and illustrate the need for vigilance in caring for these patients.

Incidence of acute hypersensitivity reactions to currently available crotaline antivenoms in pediatric patients Elizabeth Grossarta, Gabriella Gambadorob, Geoffrey Smelskic and Farshad Mazda Shirazic aDepartment of Emergency Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA; bBanner University Medical Center \u2013 Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA; cArizona Poison and Drug Information Center, Tucson, AZ, USA Background: Rattlesnake envenomations in our region are routinely treated with antivenom. Fab and F(ab\u2019)2 antivenoms (AV), with no Fc portion, lower protein content, and more efficient purification, have been shown to elicit fewer hypersensitivity reactions than whole IgG antivenom. Acute hypersensitivity reactions to antivenom are generally not life-threatening but may affect the rate or amount of antivenom administered. Previous studies of pediatric patients aged 0\u201313 identified only one acute hypersensitivity reaction to Fab antivenom. We analyzed 197 pediatric rattlesnake envenomations who received Fab AV or F(ab\u2019)2 AV to determine incidence and characteristics of acute hypersensitivity reactions to currently available crotaline antivenoms. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of patients aged 0\u201313 years diagnosed with rattlesnake envenomation and treated with Fab AV or F(ab\u2019)2 AV between January 2001 and December 2020. Specifically, we sought to identify children who developed acute hypersensitivity reactions after infusion of AV.

The patient, was evaluated at a tertiary care center with metformin associated metabolic acidosis (MAMA) and osmolar gaps >30 mOsm/L in the absence of toxic alcohol exposure. Diagnosis of MAMA was made by board certified medical toxicologists based on presentation with severe metabolic acidosis, lactate elevation, and metformin exposure with factors that would decrease metformin elimination. In this case, diagnosis was confirmed with quantitative serum metformin levels of 470 mcg/mL. She had a pH 15 mMol/L. The patient presented soon after an acute ingestion of 90 gm of metformin and 60 tablets of acetaminophen-diphenhydramine combination product. By the time she was transferred to the tertiary care center 3 h later, she was anuric. Osmolar gap was calculated using the standard equation [(2\u00d7Na)+(BUN/2.8) + glucose/18)]. Ethanol was negative. Osmolar gap was calculated at 34.8 mOsm/kg for the patient. Methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol were ruled out by history and collateral information. She was treated with continuous hemodialysis (HD) for 47.75 h until serum lactate levels were 30 mOsm/kg. Patients with MAMA can develop an osmolar gap of >30 mOsm/kg.

At the end of Consolidation, the patient was stratified to a high risk group with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation because of insufficient response to therapy. At that time, targeted RNA sequencing detected NUP214::ABL1 gene fusion which was previously missed due to a small microduplication in the 9q34 chromosome region. Gene variant analysis revealed no TKI-resistant ABL1 mutations; therefore, treatment with Imatinib was added to target the NUP214::ABL1 fusion protein. A negative minimal residual disease was achieved, and treatment was downgraded to intermediate risk protocol. Combining routine genetic assays with next-generation sequencing methods could prevent from missing atypical gene alterations.

Keywords: case report, targeted therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, imatinib, BCRABL1- like INTRODUCTION Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous disease with certain cytogenetic aberrations being long-recognized to be anticipated an unfavourable prognosis. A new BCR-ABL-like subgroup of tyrosine-kinase driven ALL has been associated with a poor response to chemotherapy, a high relapse risk, and unfavorable long-term outcomes (1). In the 2016 updated World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia, BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL was added as a new provisional entity (2). Its gene expression profile is similar to BCR::ABL1, however, is lacking BCR::ABL1 fusion (3). The presence of Nucleoporin 214-ABL Proto-Oncogene 1 (NUP214::ABL1) gene fusion is detected in 6% of T-ALL, whereas it is rare in B-ALL (4). A series of genes that activate tyrosine kinase and cytokine receptor signaling are affected in BCR-ABL1-like ALL, suggesting the potential interest of targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (5). However, the therapeutic effect of TKI for the NUP214::ABL1-positive patients is disputable as clinical experience is limited (6\u201311). Standard worldwide screening methods for known ABL1 gene fusions include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (12). Nevertheless, these screening techniques detect a limited number of alterations as BCR-ABL1-like ALL is known for its highly heterogeneous background (13). We present a case of pediatric B-ALL with a cryptic NUP214:: ABL1 gene fusion which was initially missed during diagnostic screening due to unusual genetic alteration and was identified by the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) only. Treatment with a first-generation TKI (imatinib) was added to the chemotherapy with a good effect. CASE DESCRIPTION A 15 year-old boy with no previous significant medical history was admitted to our pediatric department in July 2020 for high fever, petechial and hemorrhagic rash, and vomiting. The blood count showed hemoglobin 51 g/L, platelet count 34 \u00d7 109/L, and hyperleukocytosis 464.5 109/L. Immunophenotyping confirmed the expression of B-lymphoid markers CD45, CD19, CD10, CD20, CD81, CD22, cCD22, CD24, and cCD79a. Routine genomic screening by a single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) detected normal male karyotype 46,XY without larger aberrations in size \u22655 Mb. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any of the following recurrent rearrangements: BCR::ABL1, KMT2A, EPOR, ABL1, ABL2, RUNX1 (CSF1R), PDGFRB, E2A (TCF3), JAK2, ETV6::RUNX1, or CRLF2. Cerebrospinal fluid showed three WBC/\u03bcl and ~5.8% of aberrant phenotype B-lymphoid cells, with no leukemic blasts in cytospin. B-ALL, CNS1 was diagnosed. Treatment was conducted according to ALLTogether protocol Induction B with dexamethasone, vincristine, daunorubicin, pegylated-asparaginase (PEG-Asp), and intrathecal methotrexate. At the end of induction, at time point 1 (TP1), minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow showed residual cells of 0.79% by flow cytometry (FC) and 0.03% by IG/TCR FIGURE 1 | Treatment flowchart and timeline of symptoms.

Discrepancy in the lab results was interpreted as a subclone of leukemic cells that was not captured by PCR, and the patient was stratified to intermediate-high risk (IR-H) due to a slow response to the therapy as per protocol (Figure 1). Consolidation with dexamethasone, vincristine, 6- mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, PEG-Asp, and intrathecal methotrexate was given according to IR-H protocol. Bone marrow evaluation on day 71, time point 2 (TP2) still showed positive MRD: ~0.18% and 0.07% by FC and IG/TCR quantitative PCR respectively. The patient was stratified into High-Risk (HR) group with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (Figure 1). Chemotherapy was complicated by multiple side effects. The patient was treated at the intensive care unit twice because of repeated tonic-clonic seizures caused by venous sinus thrombosis in Induction phase and because of severe acute pancreatitis in Consolidation 1. Acute pancreatitis was complicated by multiple organ dysfunction including renal function impairment and toxic myocarditis. Furthermore, the patient suffered from malnutrition, liver toxicity and mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. On day 71 (TP2), targeted RNA sequencing was performed on patient\u2019s RNA sample using TruSight Pan- Cancer sequencing kit as described earlier (14). Sequencing data analysis revealed t(9;9)(q34;q34)/NUP214::ABL1 gene fusion. Exon 33 of the NUP214 gene and exon 3 of the ABL1 gene were fused. RT-PCR method was used to confirm NUP214:: ABL1 fusion transcript. Gene variant analysis showed no TKIresistant ABL1 mutations; therefore, treatment with a firstgeneration TKI imatinib mesylate was added to the conventional chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) was achieved within a month, and treatment was downgraded to intermediate-risk protocol (Figure 1). At the time of writing the manuscript, the patient is in the first CR 24 months from diagnosis. The present report was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional ethical review board permission for a case report was obtained and a written informed consent was received from the patient and his parents. DISCUSSION Cryptic NUP214::ABL1 fusion is a rare genetic entity carrying kinase activating alterations and making the patients candidates for TKI treatment. Although ABL1 gene rearrangements are most commonly detected in B-ALL, NUP214::ABL1 fusion transcript is mainly described in T-ALL patients (7\u20139,11,15), whereas in TABLE 1 | Cases of B-ALL with a cryptic NUP214::ABL1 fusion.

Imatinib Effective in BCR-ABL1-like ALL B-ALL its expression is described in individual cases only. In T-ALL, chimeric NUP214::ABL1 protein showed to be sensitive to TKI in preclinical and clinical studies (11), whereas in B-ALL the role of TKI still needs to be established. In pediatric population, approximately 10%\u201315% of B-ALL cases reveal a BCR::ABL1-like profile representing a biologically and clinically challenging group (3). ABL class tyrosine kinase fusion genes are expected to be clonal leukemia drivers and usually respond well to ABL class inhibitors imatinib or dasatinib. Imatinib is generally regarded as the safest of the TKIs, with no long-term irreversible side effects. Although many authors recommend second or thirdgeneration TKIs to override the frequent ATP-binding site mutations (16,17), in our case imatinib showed a very good effect, as there was no evidence of ABL1 mutations. To the best of our knowledge, only five B-ALL cases with NUP214::ABL1 fusion caused by intrachromosomal microduplication had been published so far, data are summarized in Table 1. The patients reported were teenagers or young adults, all being >13 years old at the time of diagnosis. Four patients, for whom data was available, had high hyperleukocytosis (WBC >100 \u00d7 109/L) at presentation, similarly to our case. In all reported cases, the patients had a poor initial response to therapy and were stratified to very high risk (VHR) chemotherapy (case #4) or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (cases #1 and #5). Two patients received treatment with TKI after allo-HSCT and achieved negative MRD, however, subsequent disease progression in case #4 resulted in lethal outcome. One patient (#5) underwent successful allo-HSCT without additional TKI use. Unlike in previously reported cases, we initiated treatment with a first-generation TKI imatinib mesylate with high efficacy. Two cases (cases #1 and #4) reported a second-generation TKI dasatinib, and a choice of TKI was not specified in the cases #2 and #3. Mechanisms of resistance to imatinib are known to be related to the mutations of ATP-binding site in BCR::ABL1 positive ALL, therefore, dasatinib, nilotinib or ponatinib are FIGURE 2 | SNP-A karyotyping analysis: 9q34 amplification delimited by NUP214 and ABL1 genes. FIGURE 3 | Schematic representation of the chimeric NUP214::ABL1 protein. Pathology & Oncology Research 4 September 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610570 Stukaite-Ruibiene et al. Imatinib Effective in BCR-ABL1-like ALL preferred as first line therapy (16,17). In our case, gene variant analysis revealed no TKI resistant ABL1 mutations, which could explain a good effect of Imatinib which was added to the first line of conventional chemotherapy. This subsequently allowed to downgrade the treatment to IR-H risk thus evading allo-HSCT and potentially life-threatening further toxicity. Detection of cryptic ABL1 gene rearrangements by conventional genetic analysis can be a challenge (20, 19). Among the reported cases, NUP214::ABL1 fusion was identified early in treatment, after the first cycle of induction, in one B-ALL case only, using NGS techniques (10). In two cases, the fusion was initially missed by routine diagnosticmethods and detected later by SNP-A or targeted RNA sequencing (20, 19) (Table 1). In our case, the ABL1 gene break was initially missed by FISH array (ABL1 Break Apart Probe) due to a small 445 Kb microduplication in the 9q34 chromosome region and was detected later by performing targeted RNA sequencing. SNP-A karyotyping missed microduplication which was smaller than 5Mb in size (Figure 2). NUP214 and ABL1 genes are located at the edges of the 9q34 region, therefore, FISH cannot successfully detect NUP214::ABL1 gene fusion due to technical limitations (Figure 3). This particular cryptic fusion mechanism was described in detail by Tsujimoto et al. (20). In our previous retrospective population-based BCR::ABL1-negative B-other ALL cohort study, we did not detect any ABL-class fusions in pediatric Lithuanian patients (14), making this case to be the only NUP214:: ABL1 gene fusion case in Lithuanian childhood B-ALL emphasizing very rare incidence of this aberration. Some authors suggest that all patients with B-ALL should undergo NGS analysis in parallel with conventional genetic screening (13). In our case, adding TKI to the first line treatment enabled us to downgrade the treatment risk group for the patient. However, earlier NGS results detecting targetable genomic alteration would have been beneficial by allowing initiation of targeted therapy and possibly preventing severe drug-induced side effects. CONCLUSION Identification of rare targetable genetic subtypes is of importance in order to introduce individualized targeted therapy as early as possible to improve survival and reduce toxicity. Combining TKI with chemotherapy for ABL1 rearranged B-ALL should be considered for the first-line treatment. B-ALL in adolescent patients without detected recurrent cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities (B-others) should be immediately analyzed further by NGS methods to prevent from missing atypical gene alterations.

Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria in ethylene glycol poisoning confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Clinica Chimica Acta. 2022;531:1-3 on 10 Oct 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Spain and concerns a 34-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of lethargic, slow stimuli response, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis, drug level increased and drug poisoning associated with venlafaxine and clorazepate. The case presented was that of voluntary, self-harm poisoning in a patient who ingested two glasses of Ethylene glycol (EG), 6000 mg venlafaxine and 300 mg clorazepate with suicidal motivation. Upon arrival at the Emergency Department, 14 h after ingestion, the patient was lethargic with slow stimuli response, presenting hyperventilation (breath rate 26x\u2019) and showing metabolic acidosis (arterial blood gases: pH 7.17 pO2 106, pCO2 17, BE \u201322, CO3H 6.2, lactate 1.96, anion gap 26.1). The patient was initially treated with 1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate and fomepizole, initial dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min; 10 mg/ kg every 12 h in 30 min; switching to 10% ethanol 0.1 ml/kg/hour at 24 h due to depletion of fomepizole stock. The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for continuous hemodiafiltration, which was maintained for 6 h, subsequently switching to intermittent haemodialysis. The initial serum EG concentration was 0.39 g/L (Headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, HS-GC-FID 7697A 7890B, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The concentration of venlafaxine + desvenlafaxine was 1331 ng/ml (reference values, 100\u2013400 ng/mL) (Gas chromatography mass spectrometry, GC\u2013MS 7890A 5975C, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Serial monitoring of EG (and venlafaxine + desvenlafaxine) concentrations, along with monitoring of serum creatinine was shown. After three days in the ICU, during which time the patient presented renal failure (maximum creatinine 2.33 mg/dl), the patient later recovered. The patient was then transferred to the psychiatric hospitalization ward and discharged from the hospital after 12 days without physical sequelae. Serum creatinine measured 97 days post discharge was 0.71 mg/dL. Patient urine samples collected at admission, with a pH of 5.0, and at 6 h post-admission, with a pH of 5.5 were analysed using an automated urinalysis system (Sysmex\u00ae UN-Series, UC-3500\u2122 chemistry analyser, UF-5000\u2122 Particle Analyzer and UD-10\u2122 Digital Imaging Device). The Sysmex UD-10\u2122 was a fully automated urine particle digital imaging device used to locate, digitally store, and display microscopic images captured from urine specimens. In the image of urine sample collected at admission, crystals compatible with calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) were observed from initial phases. Subsequently, these two urine samples were sent to the Laboratory of Renal Lithiasis Research at the University of Balearic Islands. Previously, they were passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm nylon filter and the sediment was dried in a test tube. The observation of the morphology of the crystals was carried out using a scanning electron microscope S-3400 N (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) by means of which the typical structures of COM crystals in oval or hourglass shape (typical epitaxial growth) and the presence of scarce envelope-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) were observed. A third urine sample, with a pH of 7.5, collected on the eighth day after admission, revealed negative urinalyses results and no abnormal scatterplot parameters warranting microscopic review were detected. The Hospital Ethics Committee approved the study, and the patient gave her informed consent for the study. The detection of crystalluria behaves as a urinary biomarker for several acute kidney diseases. COM crystalluria usually appears between 30 and 60 min after EG ingestion. For this reason, when it was rapidly identified, its presence indicates kidney injury and can guide therapy and aid in prognosis. While the presence of COD was related to urolithiasis pathology associated with high urinary calcium concentrations, and/or hypercalciuria but unrelated to toxicological pathology. The findings indicate that the scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the urine sediment was a useful methodology to confirm the composition of the crystals detected in EG poisoning. Finally, the detection of COM crystalluria was important in any patient with suspected EG poisoning, regardless of the availability to rapidly measure its concentration in blood and whenever possible, serial monitoring of crystalluria should be performed until the resolution of the case.

A case of hypersensitivity reaction to dexamethasone presenting with shock. Critical Care Medicine. 2018;46(1):51 on 10 Jan 2018. The above citation is from conference abstract. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a health care professional from the United States and concerns a 67 year old female patient who experienced a serious adverse reaction of acute circulatory failure and anaphylactic shock associated with dexamethasone. The patient with past medical history of hypertension and kyphoscoliosis status post spinal fusion surgery performed a month before presenting with two weeks of progressively worsening paresis of the lower extremities associated with urinary and fecal incontinence and band-like distribution of pain in the T4 distribution. Her neurological examination was remarkable for a decreased tone and strength in the lower extremities with diminished sensation to pin-prick and vibration at the T4 spinal distribution. CT imaging revealed a T3-4 epidural hematoma and flexion distraction fracture of T3-4 vertebra causing cord compression. She underwent an emergent T3-4 decompressive laminectomy/facetectomy. Intraoperatively she received 10 mg of IV dexamethasone and two minutes later she developed acute circulatory failure requiring high doses of norepinephrine and epinephrine. An intra-op POCUS showed hyperdynamic LV function and normal RV:LV ratio; there was no evidence of a pericardial effusion and lung sliding was appreciated at the bilateral apices excluding cardiogenic or obstructive etiology of her shock from either massive pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax. Hypovolemic shock was unlikely given minimal blood loss. Review of her medical history from a different hospital revealed prior episodes of urticarial skin rash with IV methylprednisolone [see the linked case report# US-MLMSERVICE-20180115-1042812-1]. This clinical correlate in conjunction with the temporal relationship between administration of IV dexamethasone and the ensuing circulatory collapse prompted the diagnoses of anaphylactic shock secondary to steroids. In conclusion, hypersensitivity reactions related to steroids are uncommon and often misdiagnosed. It is unclear whether the triggering molecule is the steroid itself, or if the steroids or its metabolites act like a hapten bound to serum protein, creating an allergenic complex. Anaphylactic shock should be considered in a patient with previous IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction to any class of glucocorticoids such as urticarial skin rash with the patient.

We report a case of anaphylactic shock secondary to the administration of IV dexamethasone during spinal surgery. Methods: A 67-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension and kyphoscoliosis status post spinal fusion surgery performed a month before presenting with two weeks of progressively worsening paresis of the lower extremities associated with urinary and fecal incontinence and band-like distribution of pain in the T4 distribution. Her neurological examination was remarkable for a decreased tone and strength in the lower extremities with diminished sensation to pin-prick and vibration at the T4 spinal distribution. CT imaging revealed a T3-4 epidural hematoma and flexion distraction fracture of T3-4 vertebra causing cord compression. She underwent an emergent T3-4 decompressive laminectomy/facetectomy. Intraoperatively she received 10 mg of IV dexamethasone and two minutes later she developed acute circulatory failure requiring high doses of norepinephrine and epinephrine. An intra-op POCUS showed hyperdynamic LV function and normal RV:LV ratio; there was no evidence of a pericardial effusion and lung sliding was appreciated at the bilateral apices excluding cardiogenic or obstructive etiology of her shock from either massive pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax.

Anaphylactic shock should be considered in a patient with previous IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction to any class of glucocorticoids such as urticarial skin rash with our patient.

It occurs with highest incidence in patients with HIV infection. It has also been described in HIV negative population (immunocompromised or immunocompetent). In children it occurs extremely rarely. Thus, there is scarcity of data on this entity in pediatric individuals.We present two cases of PBL following liver transplantation with subsequent immunosuppressive therapy. The first patient is a 10-year-old girl who at the age of 5 and 15 months from liver transplantation for biliary atresia developed EBV positive PBL. The diseasewas stage 4 involving gastrointestinal tract as primary site, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone marrow (60% blasts), leptomeninges. EPOCH protocol combined with bortezomib was implemented resulting in CR. 3months from completing treatment local relapse (colon) was observed. HyperCVAD protocol was implemented. Each chemotherapy course was complicated by severe hematologic and infectious episodes including sepsis which caused treatment interruptions resulting in local disease progression. Chemotherapy with ICE protocol combined with bortezomib was administered with very good response. Tumor resection was performed followed by chemotherapywith vinblastine (6 courses) and later monotherapy with lenalidomide (12 courses). At present she is disease-free 3 yrs. 10 months from PBL diagnosis and 2 yrs. 10 mos. from tumor progression. The second patient is a 2 yrs. old boy who was diagnosed with EBV positive PBL 7 months from liver transplantation for hepatoblastoma. Prior to this diagnosis he was treated with rituximab due to polymorphic PTLD (tonsils). Intestinal hemorrhage was the first symptoms of PBL. Endoscopy revealed a large tumor in the descending colon. Biopsy was performed and pathologic diagnosis of PBL made. No other disease involvement was detected. The boy was placed on EPOCH protocol with bortezomib. Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities and infectious episodes were observed during treatment. He completed chemotherapy and is continuing to receive bortezomib. He is in CR 5 months from PBL diagnosis. Our 2 case studies illustrate therapeutic challenges encountered in children with PBL after liver transplantation in terms of decision on choice of chemotherapy especially in relapse scenario and management of treatment related complications in liver recipients.

The above citation is from a conference abstract. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Poland and concerns a 10-year-old female patient (case 1) who experienced serious adverse reactions of severe hematologic and infectious episodes including sepsis associated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone. The patient, was currently 10-year-old. At the age of 5 year and 15 months from liver transplantation for biliary atresia developed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). The disease was stage 4 involving the gastrointestinal tract as the primary site, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone marrow (60% blasts), and leptomeninges. Etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (EPOCH) protocol combined with bortezomib was implemented resulting in complete remission (CR). Three months from completing treatment, local relapse (colon) was observed. Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (Hyper CVAD) protocol was implemented. Each chemotherapy course was complicated by severe hematologic and infectious episodes including sepsis which caused treatment interruptions resulting in local disease progression. Follow-up has not been requested because we do not have contact details for the author.

It belongs to the group of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). NA and 5-HT have receptors on the surface of platelets and are involved in platelet aggregation. In this case study, we present the case of a patient treated for one of the types of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), essential thrombocythemia (ET), in whom VEN was added to pharmacotherapy during the treatment of a severe episode of depression with psychotic symptoms. We observed a gradual reduction in platelet count when increasing the dose of VEN.We also present a narrative review of literature about the effect of VEN on platelet counts and activity. We conclude that, in the group of patients taking VEN, attention should be paid to the rare adverse effect of a decrease in the number of platelets. Keywords: essential thrombocythemia; major depressive disorder; depression; SNRI; drug-induced thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia/chemically induced 1. Introduction Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of blood cancers characterized by a benign onset but with a tendency to develop into malignant cancer in the future. According to theWorld Health Organization (WHO) classification, we divide MPNs into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia (ET), chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and unclassifiable MPNs [1]. Two of them, CML and ET, are characterized by thrombocythemia in blood tests [2]. Patients with MPNs in the daytime experience a wide range of symptoms associated with abnormal cell division in the bone marrow. The most common symptoms are fatigue, pruritus, and night sweats [3]. Fatigue is also one of the common symptoms of depression [4]. A large international study shows fatigue as one of the most common symptoms of myeloproliferative neoplasm, and proves that in the ingroup of patients with this type of proliferative disease, the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) is almost 25% [5]. Another study prepared by Padrnos L. et al. also shows that depressive symptoms appear in as many as 23% of patients with MPNs [6]. One of the drugs recommended for the treatment of MDD is venlafaxine (VEN) [7]. This drug belongs to the group of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). At low doses, it causes an increase in serotoninergic transmission. At higher doses (higher than 225 mg), it causes an increase in noradrenergic transmission [8,9]. VEN is now considered one of the most effective antidepressants, which is confirmed by studies describing its efficacy in treating resistant depression [10]. Medicina 2022, 58, 626. https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58050626 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/medicina Medicina 2022, 58, 626 2 of 8 Thus far, there are no scientific reports describing the effects of depression and antidepressant treatment on the production of the morphotic elements of blood in bone marrow; however, for many years, researchers\u2019 attention has been drawn to the relationship between depression and changes in the number of platelets and mean platelet volume (MPV), as well as changes in the prothrombotic phenotype of platelets [11\u201313]. The potential cause of such changes is increased sympathetic activity in the course of depression [14]. This is due to the increased sensitivity of the nervous system to stressors in people with MDD. In this situation, stress factors, affecting the nervous system, increase corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production in the pituitary gland. CRH then affects another part of our nervous system, the locus coeruleus, in which the production of NA increases in response to CRH stimulation. The NA produced there increases the sympathetic system\u2019s activity and reduces parasympathetic activity [15,16]. Additionally, attention should be paid to the fact that two important biogenic amines, NA and 5-HT, have their own receptors on the platelet surface and are involved in the platelet aggregation process (Figure 1) [17].

Figure 1. By binding to the 5HT-2A receptor on the surface of the blood platelets, serotonin (5-HT) causes an the concentration of phospholipase C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2). It causes conversion of phosphatidylinositol- 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP\u00ac3), which activates integrin, changes shape of platelets, and at the end, causes an aggregation process. Noradrenalin (NA) exerts the same effect but by activating the \u03b12a receptor, which inhibits adenylate cyclase (AC) and lowers the cAMP concentration. This process inhibits platelet aggregation. DAG\u2014diacylglycerol. This allowed the researchers to hypothesize that the use of drugs modulating the concentrations of 5-HT and NA may affect not only the number of platelets, but also their ability to aggregate [18,19]. One such drug is VEN. Scientists have repeatedly pointed out the effect of drugs used in treating mental disorders on the number and activity of platelets. Such drugs include antipsychotics such as olanzapine or clozapine, which, apart from affecting the process of platelet aggregation, also affect their number, which can cause thrombocytopenia [20\u201322]. Other drugs that can significantly affect the platelet count are mood stabilizers, such as valproic acid [23] or lithium salts [24]. In our work, we present the case of VEN being added to therapy for a patient suffering from ET and MDD and consider the rarely reported effect of VEN lowering the platelet count. Figure 1.

Materials and Methods In this publication, we describe the case of a 71-year-old patient suffering from MDD coexisting with ET. The retrospective case report uses data from the inpatient treatment conducted by three of the authors. The patient\u2019s data were anonymized for this report. The patient was informed about the mechanism of action of VEN and its potential adverse effects; fully informed consent from the patient was obtained. We also prepare a narrative review of literature about the effect of VEN on platelet count and activity. To prepare this review, databases were reviewed to isolate reports according to the following key phrases: \u201cvenlafaxine\u201d, \u201cSNRI\u201d, \u201cplatelets\u201d, \u201cplatelet count\u201d, and \u201cessential thrombocythemia\u201d. Publications published in 1997\u20132021 were taken into account. 3. Case Study A 71-year-old patient was brought urgently by her family to the Clinical Department of Psychiatry in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry of the Medical University of Silesia. During the psychiatric examination in the emergency department, she had clearly pronounced anxiety and fear; she expressed reference, nihilistic, and sometimes catastrophic delusions; and she gave the impression that she was having auditory hallucinations. On admission, psychomotor retardation and depression of mood, of significant intensity, were also noticed. She required emergency pharmacotherapy and received 5 mg of diazepam and 2 mg of haloperidol. Later in the study, she was a bit calmer, but still suffered from severe psychomotor retardation and significant depression of mood. She was reluctant to make verbal contact\u2014the statements were sparse, she answered the questions asked with single, short sentences, and psychotic symptoms still persisted. Because of these symptoms, she was admitted to the department with the diagnosis of a severe episode of depression with psychotic symptoms in the course of recurrent depressive disorder, according to The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The family reports showed that in the few months before hospitalization, her mental state was gradually deteriorating. Symptoms such as decreasing mood and psychomotor drive, deterioration of purposeful activity, sleep disorders, difficulty in focusing, and deterioration in cognitive functions, particularly memory disorders, appeared. Three days before admission, the family observed a significant deterioration of the mental state. Additional symptoms began to appear, such as mutism, akinesia, and limited responses to stimuli. According to the family, the intensity of verbal production with delusional content increased. Both the family and the patient on admission denied episodes of mania and hypomania in the past. The analysis of the disease course indicated many years of psychiatric history. The patient was hospitalized twice in the past due to recurrent depressive disorder 17 and 18 years before the present hospitalization. Since her last hospital discharge, she had not experienced any exacerbations of disease symptoms requiring hospital treatment, but she was under constant outpatient psychiatric care. Psychopharmacological therapy prescribed before admission consisted of 45 mg of mirtazapine per day, 20 mg of citalopram per day, and 7.5 mg of zopiclone as needed. For 6 years, she had been under the control of a hematology clinic due to ET. She confirmed the presence of the Jak V617F 12.5\u201331% mutation. Because of this, she was taking 1 mg of anagrelide per day in two divided doses. The last modification of hematological treatment was made 4 months before hospitalization. The patient was also treated for hypertension for many years before hospitalization, and without any changes in the period before hospitalization, she took indapamide at a dose of 1.5 mg per day and 50 mg of metoprolol per day. On admission to the hospital, the current treatment was modified. In the beginning, constantly admitted by the patient before hospitalization, citalopram was reduced and then, within 5 days, was discontinued due to its ineffectiveness in out-of-hospital treatment. Due to psychotic symptoms, haloperidol at a daily dose of 8 mg was added to the treatment, but because of persistent psychotic experiences, it was discontinued on the seventh day Medicina 2022, 58, 626 4 of 8 of hospitalization. Instead, olanzapine was included in the treatment at an initial dose of 5 mg per day to reach a dose of 10 mg after 10 days. Because of the reduction in the intensity of psychotic experiences and persistent depressive symptoms on the 29th day of hospitalization, VEN was added to the current treatment at the initial dose of 37.5 mg. Due to the good clinical response, the dose was increased to 75 mg per day after 5 days. After 10 days, the dose of VEN was increased to 112.5 mg per day, but due to increased anxiety, the dose was reduced to 75 mg after 3 days. After 20 days, the dose was increased again to 112.5 mg per day, and after another 6 days, to 150 mg. After 92 days of VEN treatment, the dose was changed to 225 mg, which was maintained until the end of the observation period. The diagnosis and the medical history were objectified after achieving a relative improvement in the mental state. The patient then admitted to the presence of episodes of hypomania in the past, which, due to the fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria according to ICD-10, resulted in the diagnosis being changed to bipolar disorder. On the 76th day of hospitalization, aripiprazole was added to the treatment at an initial dose of 2.5 mg; after 7 days, the dose was increased to 5 mg per day. During hospitalization, the hypertensive treatment was slightly modified due to persistently high blood pressure values. On day 22, 5 mg of perindopril was added to the treatment, and this dosage was increased to 10 mg per day on day 40. The dosage of anagrelide was not modified throughout the observation period in accordance with the recommendations of the hematologist with whom the patient consulted several times during hospitalization. However, due to his recommendations, the patient\u2019s platelet count was regularly monitored by performing a complete blood count. Since VEN was added to the therapy, a gradual reduction in the number of platelets was observed. The intensity of this reduction was also dependent on the dose of VEN. Detailed changes in platelet count over time and their dependence on VEN dosing are shown in Figure 2.

The case report focuses on the treatment period from the initiation of hospitalization to the 139th day of observation due to reports in the literature that lithium salts can significantly affect the platelet count [24] and interfere with previous observations. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 5 of 8 4. Discussion Thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect that we can observe after administering many drug groups. We can also find many examples of antidepressants that may inhibit the formation of blood platelets or intensify their destruction in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and the spleen, which reduce their number in the blood [25\u201327]. However, one of the most frequently described mechanisms of platelet destruction is the mechanism that supports the increased production of anti-platelet antibodies, which is stimulated by the drugs taken [28]. One of the clinical studies that proved such an effect of antidepressant drugs is a study prepared by Song HR. et al., in which a reduction in platelet count was observed in patients receiving escitalopram or VEN, and such dependence was not observed in patients using bupropion (which belongs to the group of inhibitors of the dopamine and adrenergic receptor) [29]. It is also noteworthy that in this study, there was a stronger correlation between the use of the drug and a decrease in platelet count in the case of escitalopram than in the case of VEN, which may suggest greater importance for the inhibition of serotonergic over noradrenergic transmission. Similar conclusions were drawn from a meta-analysis carried out in 2013, which included a group of 681 patients from two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which the safety of using another SNRI representative, duloxetine, was tested. Conclusions resulting from this meta-analysis show that in the group of patients taking duloxetine compared to the placebo group, a decrease in the number of platelets was observed [30]. The reverse relationship is shown in the study prepared by Gronau W. et al., in which a statistically significant increase in the platelet number after using VEN was visible [31]. Due to the presence of \u000b2-adrenergic and 5HT-2A receptors on the surface of the platelets, it may be assumed that the effects of biogenic amine concentrations, such as NA and 5-HT, will be influenced by the platelet aggregation process. These assumptions were confirmed by an in vitro study conducted in 2012, which showed a statistically significant increase in the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen after using VEN. Nevertheless, in this study, this effect did not result in an extension of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time [32]. Despite the effect of SNRI described in the cited studies, the extent, and activity of platelets, their influence on the risk of bleeding, and the risk of cardiovascular events caused by their overactivity are still very unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the first report on the impact of VEN on the platelet aggregation process dates back to 2006. In the case study prepared by Sarma A. et al. regarding a patient in whom the administration of VEN caused the appearance of ecchymoses, the authors confirmed disorders of platelet aggregation, which they associated with the patient\u2019s intake of VEN [33]. Similar symptoms were later described by Shaligram D. et al. in a patient taking desvenlafaxine [34]. These case reports prompted the researchers to conduct studies on larger groups of patients that assessed this previously unknown effect of SNRIs. In a study conducted on a group of 4136 patients after coronary artery bypass grafting, there was no relationship between patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or SNRI before the procedure and the risk of excessive bleeding during the postoperative period and during longer follow-up. The same study showed a reduction in the risk of cardiac death, which, according to the authors, was probably related to the reduction in platelet activity [35]. Similar conclusions were drawn from a study by Smith MM et al. in a group of 1453 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were taking SSRI or SNRI. An increased risk of bleeding and postoperative mortality was also not observed in the study [36]. A study prepared by Chachal P. et al. also did not reveal an increased risk of bleeding in patients receiving SNRI after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [37]. On the other hand, in a group of patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who used SSRI and SNRI, a statistically significantly more frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed compared to patients not using these drugs [38,39]. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 6 of 8 However, even the authors of this article highlight the important role of antidepressant therapy using SSRI or SNRI in this group of patients [40,41] and are not in favor of stopping it. The case report prepared by us has some limitations. The most important limitation is polypharmacotherapy taken by the patient, which could interfere with the decrease in the number of platelets observed by us. However, to limit the impact of other drugs, in this article, we only present the period when the only modification of the therapy was the intensification of VEN doses. The second limitation is the initial misdiagnosis of MDD with bipolar disorder, which influenced the initial therapeutic decisions. However, this resulted from the patient\u2019s serious condition on admission and from the fact that both the patient and the family denied the occurrence of hypomania episodes in the past. 5. Conclusions Considering the results of scientific studies and the changes in the platelet count observed in the described patient, attention should be paid to the possible adverse effect of reducing the number of platelets in the group of patients taking VEN. Due to the probable mechanisms of this phenomenon, it is an adverse effect seemingly difficult to prevent in the case of chronic therapy. Therefore, ordering frequent complete blood count lab tests in such patients should be justified to detect it as early as possible and consider the further course of treatment. However, this topic requires further research to unambiguously determine the effect of SNRI on platelet count and activity.

ABSTRACT Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used to treat various diseases and has anticancer effects that suppress metastases in animal models of sarcoma and melanoma. However, these effects have been observed in a limited number of clinical cases. We report the case of a patient with metastatic breast cancer in which long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in the absence of salvage chemotherapy. The patient was treated with IVIG for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Surprisingly, the lung and brain metastases were stabilized, and the patient achieved a progression-free interval of 29 months. More cases are needed to investigate and confirm the efficacy of IVIG in solid tumors in the future.

ITP results in autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets in the spleen. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is derived from donor plasma and contains purified immunoglobulin G (IgG). IVIG is used to treat various diseases, including immunodeficiency, as well as autoimmune, systemic inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders [2]. IVIG exhibits anticancer effects that suppress metastases in several animal models [3,4]. However, these effects were observed in a limited number of patients, including a case report and a clinical study of metastatic melanoma [5,6] and a case report of soft tissue sarcoma [7]. Here, we report that long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in a patient with advanced breast cancer with lung and brain metastases in the absence of salvage breast cancer therapy.

(pT1N0M0, stage I; Figure 1). Figure 2 summarizes the entire clinical course, treatment, and response of the patient. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epithelial growth factor receptor were negative. She underwent breast conservation surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil. She received three cycles of chemotherapy, and thrombocytopenia developed after the second cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count,16,000/ \u00b5L) persisted and became refractory to platelet transfusion after the third cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, the patient had severe menorrhagia. As a result, adjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued, and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected. However, the platelet count did not recover to baseline during the 6-month follow-up. Bone marrow biopsy and all pertinent laboratory studies were normal except for a positive antiplatelet antibody test; therefore, a clinical diagnosis of ITP was established. Eltrombopag (25 mg daily), hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and danazol were administered, but the response was limited. Splenectomy was not considered because of the high risk of bleeding. Subsequently, she did not receive any cancer treatment. The patient developed lung metastases with a diameter of 1 cm in the right lower lobe (Figure 3) and tiny subpleural nodules in the right middle lobe 28 months after the operation. Six months later, the patient suffered from severe vertigo, headache, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance  Figure 1. Contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging.

Brain metastases were confirmed radiologically. Whole-brain radiotherapy was administered (14 fractions of 3500 mGy) in March 2019. The sizes of the brain metastases were all regressed (with the largest size of approximately 1.3 cm) (Figure 4B). For refractory ITP and a high risk of bleeding, the patient began to receive IVIGs at a dosage of 0.4 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Her platelet count recovered to approximately 100,000/\u00b5L in subsequent cycles of IVIG therapy. Notably, the lung metastases slightly decreased half a year after the initiation of IVIG (all of them less than 1 cm) (Figure 3). Moreover, in further repeated imaging studies, metastatic breast cancer in the brain and lungs remained stable without new metastatic lesions for 29 months (Figures 3 and 4). No side effects from IVIG therapy were reported, and the patient maintained a normal life. During the course, the patient did not receive palliative chemotherapy or targeted therapy for breast cancer.  DISCUSSION Of all subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer has the worst prognosis and the highest likelihood of recurrence. Published data suggest that metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has a median survival of approximately 1 year [8] and a 5-year survival rate of 12% [9]. This is the first known case of sustained tumor stabilization from IVIG treatment alone in an advanced triple-negative breast cancer patient with lung and brain metastases. Without any anticancer therapy, IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer and metastases in the lungs and brain. This therapy provided a prolonged progressionfree survival time of at least 29 months in our patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This extraordinary outcome suggests that IVIG may be an alternative therapy for breast cancer. Clinical experience with IVIG for patients with cancer is scarce, but beneficial antimetastatic effects have been described in several animal studies [5-7,10]. In mouse models of melanoma and sarcoma, the administration of IVIG significantly inhibited cancer progression and prolonged survival [10]. A similar effect was reported in a mouse model of sarcoma [7]. Recently, Xu et al. [11] demonstrated that low-dose IgG might induce macrophage polarization toward the M1 profile, and it was effective in suppressing tumor progression in mouse models of three cancer types (melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer). https://ejbc.kr  https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8  255  \fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer  A  B  C  D  Figure 4.

The red arrows indicated the metastatic brain lesions. MR = magnetic resonance; IVIG = intravenous immunoglobulin; WBRT = whole brain radiotherapy.  The antimetastatic effects and safety of IVIG have been reported. In one case report, a patient with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor received IVIG (0.4 g/kg) once every 6 weeks for multiple sclerosis and had a stable disease status for 30 months [7]. In another case report, a patient with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) experienced liver metastasis regression and stabilization of lung metastases for 9 months [5]. In a third report, nine patients with metastatic melanoma who failed prior chemotherapy and immunotherapy were treated with IVIG therapy (1 g/kg) every 3 weeks [6]. Two of the patients achieved stable disease status for 3 and 8 months, respectively, but the metastases progressed thereafter. To our knowledge, no other clinical reports have illustrated the substantial antimetastatic effect of IVIG therapy on solid tumors. In our case, a patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving only IVIG therapy achieved stable disease status for more than 2 years. This indicates that IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage cancer and has great potential for metastatic solid tumor treatment. https://ejbc.kr  https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8  256  \fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer  The mechanisms by which IVIG inhibits metastasis progression are multifactorial and not fully understood. IVIG may halt tumor progression by inducing tumor cell apoptosis [4,12]. IVIG was observed to enhance the apoptotic gene expression of p53, p21, and pRb in cancer cells and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation [3]. IVIG also induces interleukin-12 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 secretion, which potentiates natural killer cell activity and increases anticancer effects. Antiangiogenic effects and activity against tumor adhesion machinery have also been proposed [10]. IVIG protects the basement membrane and intercellular matrix integrity and prevents cell invasion by decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-9 mRNA expression and protein levels [7]. F(ab')2 fragments from IVIG have an affinity for binding to cancer cells and initiating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [13]. Dom\u00ednguez-Soto et al. observed that the dissemination of tumors depends on tumor-associated macrophages (M2), and IVIG could inhibit this process by modulating cytokines and inducing M2 (protumoral)-to-M1 (antitumoral) polarization [14]. The current study showed that IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer and metastases in the lungs and brain without any anticancer therapy, except for whole-brain radiotherapy. Although whole-brain radiotherapy may have contributed to the progression of brain metastases, it is noteworthy that a previous study reported that the intracranial progression-free duration was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5\u20138.5 months) in patients with multiple brain metastases [15]. Furthermore, the median survival after a diagnosis of brain metastases in patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy was 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.5\u20138.9 months) [16]. In another retrospective study, the median survival for patients with brain metastases who received whole-brain radiotherapy was 4.2 months [17]. Consequently, the improved survival might not be entirely attributable to wholebrain radiotherapy. It is possible that both IVIG and whole-brain radiotherapy provided a synergistic or additive effect on the stabilization of brain metastases. The effect of IVIG therapy and radiation therapy on brain metastases should be considered in further long-term follow-up studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In conclusion, we report the first case of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and brain that was incidentally stabilized by IVIG treatment. The administration of IVIG may play a role in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis with few side effects in patients with solid tumors.  REFERENCES 1. Kistangari G, McCrae KR.

ABSTRACT Background/Significance: Catatonia is common in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis (Espinola-Nadurille, 2019). The glutamate NMDAR antagonists amantadine and memantine are effective in catatonia (Beach, 2017), but data on their use in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is limited. We describe three patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis treated with NMDAR antagonists and propose a possible mechanism underlying differential outcomes. Case 1: A 20-year-old woman presented with catatonic symptoms after successful treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with immunotherapy and salpingo-oopherectomy for ovarian teratoma. Initial Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score was 22. Lorazepam 2.5 mg three times daily was partially effective, but increased doses caused sedation. Memantine was titrated to 10 mg twice daily with complete resolution of catatonia over two weeks. Case 2: A 26-year-old woman presented with catatonic with BFCRS score of 25, after successful immunotherapy for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Lorazepam 2 mg four times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused respiratory depression. Memantine 10 mg daily resulted in further improvement. Lorazepam titration to 4 mg four times daily was then possible, with complete resolution of catatonia over two weeks. Case 3: A 31-year-old woman with anti-NMDAR encephalitis presented with catatonic symptoms with BFCRS score of 22, after a hospital course significant for limited response to immunotherapy with persistently elevated serum anti-NMDAR antibody titers. Lorazepam 2 mg three times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused sedation. Both amantadine 100 mg twice daily and memantine 10 mg were trialed but were discontinued due to agitation. Mutism and negativism persisted, with a discharge BFCRS score of 12. Discussion: Memantine was effective for catatonia and well tolerated in two patients with successfully treated anti-NMDAR encephalitis, but both amantadine and memantine caused agitation in a third patient with active disease. NMDARs are reversibly internalized in the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies, leading to a compensatory increase in downstream glutamatergic tone. We hypothesize that NMDAR reemergence after successful treatment, in the context of excess extracellular glutamate, creates a state of excitotoxicity contributing to catatonic signs for which NMDAR blockade can be effective. In the third case, where NMDARs presumably remained internalized in the presence of persistent anti-NMDAR antibodies and a state of NMDAR hypofunction persisted, further NMDAR blockade caused clinical worsening. Conclusion/Implications: NMDAR antagonists can be safe and effective in patients with residual catatonia following successful treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis but may be less useful during active disease. More work is needed to clarify best practices for patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis. References: 1. Espinola-Nadurille M, Flores-Rivera J, Rivas-Alonso V, et al.

In the present research, we reported an acute myeloid leukemia subject. The patient was treated with Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6, and Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3. During treatment, the patient suffered from 3 life-threatening complications caused by chemotherapy drugs include sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), refractory thrombocytopenia, and pericardial effusion with pericardiocentesis limitation. To this end, we tried three novel approaches for patient management by Corticosteroid and Colchicine. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective in thrombocytopenia. However, eltrombopag (25 mg/kg/d) response was dramatic. Moreover, pericardial effusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed with Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d); meanwhile, the massive pericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed with Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) through the mentioned treatment. Fortunately, these approaches were effective and life-saving.

Received: September 08, 2020; Accepted: March 08, 2022  AML is treated via a highly potent chemotherapy regimen with severe complications. Its treatment complications could affect the main organs, including bone marrow, heart, liver, and kidney. The limitation of access to new drugs, in other words,  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  their unavailability in low- or middle-income countries, is known to be a challenge for pediatric oncologists.2 Critical conditions, such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, steatosis, and pseudocirrhosis, are more commonly associated with chemotherapy. It is important to anticipate and recognize these adverse effects so that appropriate clinical measures could be taken. Patients with these liver manifestations can be normally managed with supportive therapies and Defibrotide. Liver toxicity may also be resolved after discontinuation of chemotherapy. 3 Defibrotide is unavailable in Iran. Refractory thrombocytopenia limits many invasive procedures in oncologic patients, such as surgical operation or biopsy and other therapeutic or diagnostic actions. In this article, we solved three challenges of treatment employing new alternative treatment options.  Case Presentation Our subject was a four year-old male patient from Iran presenting pancytopenia, who was admitted to Shahid Madani hospital (Khoramabad in Lorestan province/Iran). There was no history of any hematological disorders. On examination, the patient had pallor and mild splenic enlargement, measuring 1.5 cm on the left below  the costal margin. Lymphadenopathy or any abnormal physical findings were unremarkable. The patient had been suffering from prolonged fever and nocturnal sweats along with weakness and fatigue. Morphology and immunophenotyping peripheral blood cells were examined with an automated hematologic analyzer (Sysmex, XE-5000, Vienna, Austria). Peripheral blood smear examination showed normocytic normochromic red blood cells, including a few nucleated red blood cells. White blood cells showed shift to the left with a significant number of myeloid blast cells. Several giant platelets and platelet aggregates were seen. The leukocyte differential count was eosinophils 3%, lymphocytes 70%, and neutrophils 27%, and band forms 1%. Coagulation tests indicated a prolonged prothrombin time of 16.3 sec (reference range, 10.2 to 13.8), a normal activated partial Thromboplastin time, normal fibrinogen, and an increased D-dimer concentration of 4.96 mg/mL (reference range, 0 to 0.35). Bone marrow smears were stained with Wright-Giemsa and analyzed according to the routine clinical laboratory procedures. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed an increased abnormal megakaryocytic. Monolobated and multinucleated megakaryocytic with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei were  Figure 1. Left side shows myeloblast in peripheral blood in Wright-Giemsa staining (\u00d7 100) and right side (\u00d7 10).  557  Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  also seen, which showed that the myeloblast cells (Figure 1) were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34, CD14, CD71, CD117, MPO, HLA-DR, CD3, CD15, CD235a, and human leukocyte antigenDR. The biochemical parameters, namely uric acid, bilirubin, creatinine, and liver enzymes, were normal. Serum LDH was highly increased. The diagnosis was confirmed as AML-M4. Cytogenetic study of bone marrow myeloblasts showed t (8,21). The patient was critically ill due to a high pulmonary pressure and respiratory distress. First echocardiography showed a high pulmonary pressure and a small amount of pericardial effusion. Lasix and Sildenafil were started for the patient. Based on this diagnosis and concerning the patient\u2019s severely compromised overall condition, we started the therapy with Dutch-Belgian pediatric AML protocol for children with newly diagnosed AML: First course: Ara-C Idarubicin Etoposide Thioguanin (AIET) induction 6-Thioguanin 100 mg/m2 orally every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 3, 4. Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4; Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4; Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6;  Triple intrathecal with Ara-C and MTX and Hydrocortisone was injected based on ageadjusted instruction. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Second course: Ara-C Mitoxantrone (AM) induction Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day as continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3; Triple intrathecal injection similar to the first induction course. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Consolidation therapy Cytarabine 2 g/m2 every 12 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3 (a total of six doses); Etoposide 100 mg/m 2 as a 60-minute IV infusion on days 2, 3, 4, 5; Triple intrathecal injection similar to the first and second induction courses. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Following the first chemotherapy course, the patient was involved in refractory thrombocytopenia. Frequent infusion of the random donor or single donor apheresis platelets were done, but platelet count was sometimes greater than 20000. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective. After the second chemotherapy course, we treated him with eltrombopag (EP) (25 mg/kg/d). Furthermore, following the initiation of  Figure 2. Left side shows cardiomegaly due to pericardial effusion and right side shows decreasing effusion after prednisolone and Colchicine.  Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  558  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  chemotherapy, in every course, the patient was involved in pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed via Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d). Nevertheless, massive pericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed using Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) with the mentioned treatment (Figure 2). After the third chemotherapy courses, the total and direct bilirubin increased, but transaminases were normal. Moderate Pitting edema and ascites were found in the patient. The liver looked large on examination. Serum albumin ranged from 2.5 to 3.5. Hepatic color Doppler sonography was normal. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) were suggested based on Baltimore criteria, but the liver biopsy was not done. The morning after the initiation of HDMT (Day +13), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were elevated to 459 U/L, 199 U/L, and 2.4 g/dL, respectively. Prothrombin time was further prolonged (16.5 seconds; INR=1.56). BUN was 3 mg/dL and Cr 0.4 mg/ dL. On the morning of Day +14, serum AST, ALT, total bilirubin, BUN, and Cr were 1108 U/L, 489 U/L, 2.9 g/ dL, 5 mg/dL, and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively. By Day +15, serum AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin had risen to 1494 U/L, 781 U/L, 3.4 g/dL, and 1.51 g/dL, respectively. Thereafter, the patient\u2019s condition improved gradually. One week later (Day +20), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin returned to 91 U/L, 197 U/L, and 1.4 g/dL, respectively. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Defibrotide is the standard treatment for hepatic VOD; however, this drug was not available in Iran. We treated him with an alternative protocol as follows: Methyl prednisolone pulse (30 mg/kg/d for three days) and UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) The Ethics Committee of the Lorestan University of Medical Sciences approved the present case presentation (Ethics Code: IR.LUMS.REC.1400.304). Written informed consent was received from the patient. 559  Discussion Cytoreductive chemotherapy regimen in AML causes certain life-threatening complications, such as refractory thrombocytopenia, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and cardiovascular problems. Therefore, using the classic treatment of these challenges face limitations in the Iranian AML patients. Defibrotide is believed to be one of effective drugs for SOS, which is not available in Iran. Moreover, the use of eltrombopag in AML patients is accompanied with a high risk of disease progression. Thrombocytopenia in AML is a life-threatening problem with a few treatment options. Platelet transfusions are limited by alloimmunization. Frequent transfusion of ABO-mismatched platelets leads to early platelet refractoriness. ABO-mismatched platelets are as effective as matched platelets in patients with low-titer isoagglutinins, such as oncologic patients or those requiring only a few transfusions. However, the greater incidence of early refractoriness induced in major mismatched group (MMG) patients indicates that ABO-mismatched platelets should not be given to patients with marrow failure requiring a long-term support.4 Concerning our patient, ABO-mismatched platelet was probably transfused due to the situation. Furthermore, Rituximab, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are new treatment strategies for severe HLA alloimmune platelet refractoriness. These options can overcome severe platelet refractoriness owing to polyspecific HLA alloimmunization.5 Our patient received IVIg without any response. We did not have any time for weekly Rituximab efficacy. EP is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which increases platelet counts and has preclinical antileukemic activity. In 2015, multi-center, randomized, placebocontrolled, trial patients aged 18 years or older, received EP doses up to 300 mg on a daily basis. There was an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.6 The treatment with EP results in a reduction in free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  dose-dependent manner. Increased intracellular iron eliminates the antiproliferative and induction effects of EP cell differentiation. Its antileukemic effects have been shown to be mediated by changes in the amount of intracellular iron.7 EP is also a safe and effective therapy for refractory thrombocytopenia after haplo-HSCT.8 It could reduce platelet transfusion requirements in thrombocytopenic patients with advanced MDS and AML. EP might also be a treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS, who are ineligible for other treatments and are not receiving disease-modifying treatment EP as escalated dose from 50 mg daily up to 200 mg daily up to 200 mg daily well-tolerated and has modest responses in heavily treated, predominantly higher-risk MDS patients or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or AML after HMA failure.9 Another use of EP in leukemia settings is in the treatment of severe refractory thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CML),10 and in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) secondary to chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLL).11 Therefore, we did not worry about leukemia relapse during the drug use. We treated our patient with dose 1 mg/kg/d because of the cost of drug. In addition, we utilized Prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/d for a synergistic effect as a synergistic drug. In 2016, a number of newly diagnosed AML patients aged >60 years (yrs) with ECOG scores of 0-2, no active second malignancy, and no evidence of marrow fibrosis at the time of AML diagnosis were treated with anthracycline (daunorubicin at 45_mg/m2 or Idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 x 3 days) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2 \u00d7 7 days). Eltrombopag was administered and started from day 15. This study suggested that eltrombopag can accelerate platelet recovery, potentially reduce platelet transfusions, and increase complete remission rate (CR) in older AML patients.12 Regarding our patient, we did not detect any signs of relapse during eltrombopag administration. Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  Nonetheless, in 2019, Dr. Frey reported that eltrombopag in combination with induction of chemotherapy in patients with AML did not have favorable outcomes.13 Despite this report, we should have used this drug herein since other treatments, such as platelet transfusion and IVIg, were not efficacious. Hepatic VOD, also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), rapidly progresses and involves life-threatening complications that can occur in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation after heavy chemotherapy regimens. K+-sparing diuretic, low protein diet, and non-absorbable oral antibiotics are the general strategies for the management of this situation. Hepatic VOD or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is one of the adverse effects of chemotherapy drugs or severe combined chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy-induced Sinusoidal Injury (CSI) score is a tool used as an immunohistochemical panel consisting of CD34, SMA, and GS. It may serve as an objective marker of chemotherapyinduced sinusoidal injury and could be conducive to diagnosis of this peculiar form of liver injury. Unfortunately, due to severe thrombocytopenia, pediatric gastrointestinal service rejects liver biopsy. Platelet transfusions should be limited as much as possible because repeated platelet transfusion increases the risk of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction. This was not possible in our patient because there was a risk of life-threatening bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia. Properly assessing fluid and electrolyte balance may be difficult due to the accumulation of ascites during SOS. In these cases, aggressive treatment with diuretics should be avoided due to the severe reduction in effective intravascular volume, which is prone to accumulation of sludge in the liver sinusoids. Defibrotide is now the first-line therapy IV during the first 17-21 days.14 However, Defibrotide is not available in Iran and our patient had a life-threatening situation. In 2008, Lun Chen and colleagues reported a case of rhabdomyosarcoma in a 21-month-old 560  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  boy who developed pancytopenia, dyspnea, jaundice, massive ascites, and body weight gain of more than 10% after receiving conventional chemotherapy. Hepatic VOD was diagnosed. He recovered after supportive care and treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone. He was diagnosed with VOD based on the abovementioned findings, and Solumedrol was administered (15 mg/kg, every 12 hours for six doses).15 In addition, the third challenging problem in our patient was the combination of severe thrombocytopenia and masssive pericardial effusion, which required pericardiocentesis, but due to severe thrombocytopenia, needle aspiration was not possible in this patient. Severe thrombocytopenia limited needle aspiration through the pericardium. Therefore, we had to treat our patient with medication. Moreover, there was counterindication concerning ASA and other NSAIDs in our case. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent used to treat gout and Beh\u00c1et's disease. In gout, it is less preferred to NSAIDs or steroids. Some of its other uses include the prevention of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever. Recent studies have reported that it is effective in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. In our patient, we administered a combination of prednisone (2 mg/kg/d) and Colchicine (0.5 mg/d). In 2013, Colchicine was used (at a dose of 0.5 mg) twice daily for 3 months for adult patients with acute pericarditis weighing >70 kg and 0.5 mg once a day for those weighing \u226470 kg. These patients treated with Colchicine added to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy, significantly reduced the rate of incessant or recurrent pericarditis.16 Experience with colchicine in the treatment of malignant pericardial effusion in solid tumors is relatively extensive, but experience with the use of this drug in the management of pericardial effusion due to leukemia is very limited. It is not a routine treatment. Colchicine was administered as an adjunctive therapy after pericardiocentesis and not as a primary treatment. 561  In patients with malignant pericardial effusion who underwent pericardiocentesis, the use of Colchicine was associated with less all-cause mortality and reduced the need for subsequent interventions. In our patient, we only used drug therapy without pericardiocentesis. Colchicine should be frequently administered in patients with adhesions and constriction after initial catheter drainage. Subsequently, the course of high-dose steroid should continue Colchicine for 4 months in order to prevent constriction.17 The concomitant occurrence of sinus obstruction syndrome (SOS) and refractory and severe thrombocytopenia, which requires repeated platelet transfusions, is a challenging and dangerous dilemma for the oncologist because repeated platelet transfusion cause platelets accumulation in the liver to repair sinusoidal cell damage, and these conditions creates critical and dangerous conditions for the patient while receiving myeloablative chemotherapeutic agents caused by SOS. This phenomenon also act as a platelet sequestration place. Endothelial protective therapy or antiplatelet therapy, such as ASA, may be helpful in treating SOS. However, antiplatelet therapy had counterindication in our patient due to severe thrombocytopenia, but the treatment of endothelial inflammation of the liver sinusoids with a steroid pulse could facilitate the management of SOS in the absence of the drug of choice (defibrothyde) and save the patient's life.18 The interaction between Colchicine and platelet function was another challenge in this patient. Colchicine may have a beneficial cardiovascular effect by targeting the platelet-inflammatory axis. Whether targeting this pathway in vivo can offer protection from atherothrombosis without increasing the bleeding risk observed with traditional platelet-directed therapies remains unknown, for which future investigation is required.19  Conclusion In acute myeloid leukemia drugs, the sideeffects are known to be a big challenge for oncologists. In developing countries, the use of Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  alternative therapies in the management of these complications instead of expensive and unattainable drugs is one of the most innovative treatment options for patients. The most important advantage of this solution is its cost-effectiveness and high efficacy. Steroids in various doses, along with Colchicine, have a life-saving role in improving the life-threatening side-effects of drugs in the liver (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome), heart (pericarditis), and bone marrow (transfusion-associated GVHD) of cancer patients.  7.  8.  9.

It belongs to the group of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). NA and 5-HT have receptors on the surface of platelets and are involved in platelet aggregation. In this case study, we present the case of a patient treated for one of the types of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), essential thrombocythemia (ET), in whom VEN was added to pharmacotherapy during the treatment of a severe episode of depression with psychotic symptoms. We observed a gradual reduction in platelet count when increasing the dose of VEN.We also present a narrative review of literature about the effect of VEN on platelet counts and activity. We conclude that, in the group of patients taking VEN, attention should be paid to the rare adverse effect of a decrease in the number of platelets. Keywords: essential thrombocythemia; major depressive disorder; depression; SNRI; drug-induced thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia/chemically induced 1. Introduction Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of blood cancers characterized by a benign onset but with a tendency to develop into malignant cancer in the future. According to theWorld Health Organization (WHO) classification, we divide MPNs into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia (ET), chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and unclassifiable MPNs [1]. Two of them, CML and ET, are characterized by thrombocythemia in blood tests [2]. Patients with MPNs in the daytime experience a wide range of symptoms associated with abnormal cell division in the bone marrow. The most common symptoms are fatigue, pruritus, and night sweats [3]. Fatigue is also one of the common symptoms of depression [4]. A large international study shows fatigue as one of the most common symptoms of myeloproliferative neoplasm, and proves that in the ingroup of patients with this type of proliferative disease, the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) is almost 25% [5]. Another study prepared by Padrnos L. et al. also shows that depressive symptoms appear in as many as 23% of patients with MPNs [6]. One of the drugs recommended for the treatment of MDD is venlafaxine (VEN) [7]. This drug belongs to the group of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). At low doses, it causes an increase in serotoninergic transmission. At higher doses (higher than 225 mg), it causes an increase in noradrenergic transmission [8,9]. VEN is now considered one of the most effective antidepressants, which is confirmed by studies describing its efficacy in treating resistant depression [10]. Medicina 2022, 58, 626. https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58050626 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/medicina Medicina 2022, 58, 626 2 of 8 Thus far, there are no scientific reports describing the effects of depression and antidepressant treatment on the production of the morphotic elements of blood in bone marrow; however, for many years, researchers\u2019 attention has been drawn to the relationship between depression and changes in the number of platelets and mean platelet volume (MPV), as well as changes in the prothrombotic phenotype of platelets [11\u201313]. The potential cause of such changes is increased sympathetic activity in the course of depression [14]. This is due to the increased sensitivity of the nervous system to stressors in people with MDD. In this situation, stress factors, affecting the nervous system, increase corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production in the pituitary gland. CRH then affects another part of our nervous system, the locus coeruleus, in which the production of NA increases in response to CRH stimulation. The NA produced there increases the sympathetic system\u2019s activity and reduces parasympathetic activity [15,16]. Additionally, attention should be paid to the fact that two important biogenic amines, NA and 5-HT, have their own receptors on the platelet surface and are involved in the platelet aggregation process (Figure 1) [17]. Medicina 2022, 58, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 8 [8,9].

Figure 1. By binding to the 5HT-2A receptor on the surface of the blood platelets, serotonin (5-HT) causes an the concentration of phospholipase C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2). It causes conversion of phosphatidylinositol- 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP\u00ac3), which activates integrin, changes shape of platelets, and at the end, causes an aggregation process. Noradrenalin (NA) exerts the same effect but by activating the \u03b12a receptor, which inhibits adenylate cyclase (AC) and lowers the cAMP concentration. This process inhibits platelet aggregation. DAG\u2014diacylglycerol. This allowed the researchers to hypothesize that the use of drugs modulating the concentrations of 5-HT and NA may affect not only the number of platelets, but also their ability to aggregate [18,19]. One such drug is VEN. Scientists have repeatedly pointed out the effect of drugs used in treating mental disorders on the number and activity of platelets. Such drugs include antipsychotics such as olanzapine or clozapine, which, apart from affecting the process of platelet aggregation, also affect their number, which can cause thrombocytopenia [20\u201322]. Other drugs that can significantly affect the platelet count are mood stabilizers, such as valproic acid [23] or lithium salts [24]. In our work, we present the case of VEN being added to therapy for a patient suffering from ET and MDD and consider the rarely reported effect of VEN lowering the platelet count. Figure 1. By binding to the 5HT-2A receptor on the surface of the blood platelets, serotonin (5-HT) causes an increase in the concentration of phospholipase C\f (PLC\f). It causes conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP-3), which activates integrin, changes shape of platelets, and at the end, causes an aggregation process. Noradrenalin (NA) exerts the same effect but by activating the \u000b2a receptor, which inhibits adenylate cyclase (AC) and lowers the cAMP concentration. This process inhibits platelet aggregation. DAG\u2014diacylglycerol. This allowed the researchers to hypothesize that the use of drugs modulating the concentrations of 5-HT and NA may affect not only the number of platelets, but also their ability to aggregate [18,19]. One such drug is VEN. Scientists have repeatedly pointed out the effect of drugs used in treating mental disorders on the number and activity of platelets. Such drugs include antipsychotics such as olanzapine or clozapine, which, apart from affecting the aggregation, also affect their number, which can cause thrombocytopenia [20\u201322]. Other drugs that can significantly affect the platelet count are mood stabilizers, such as valproic acid [23] or lithium salts [24]. In our work, we of VEN being added to therapy for a patient suffering from ET and MDD and consider the rarely reported effect of VEN lowering the platelet count. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 3 of 8 2. Materials and Methods In this publication, we describe the case of a 71-year-old patient suffering from MDD coexisting with ET. The retrospective case report uses data from the inpatient treatment conducted by three of the authors. The patient\u2019s data were anonymized for this report. The patient was informed about the mechanism of action of VEN and its potential adverse effects; fully informed consent from the patient was obtained. We also prepare a narrative review of literature about the effect of VEN on platelet count and activity. To prepare this review, databases were reviewed to isolate reports according to the following key phrases: \u201cvenlafaxine\u201d, \u201cSNRI\u201d, \u201cplatelets\u201d, \u201cplatelet count\u201d, and \u201cessential thrombocythemia\u201d. Publications published in 1997\u20132021 were taken into account. 3. Case Study A 71-year-old patient was brought urgently by her family to the Clinical Department of Psychiatry in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry of the Medical University of Silesia. During the psychiatric examination in the emergency department, she had clearly pronounced anxiety and fear; she expressed reference, nihilistic, and sometimes catastrophic delusions; and she gave the impression that she was having auditory hallucinations. On admission, psychomotor retardation and depression of mood, of significant intensity, were also noticed. She required emergency pharmacotherapy and received 5 mg of diazepam and 2 mg of haloperidol. Later in the study, she was a bit calmer, but still suffered from severe psychomotor retardation and significant depression of mood. She was reluctant to make verbal contact\u2014the statements were sparse, she answered the questions asked with single, short sentences, and psychotic symptoms still persisted. Because of these symptoms, she was admitted to the department with the diagnosis of a severe episode of depression with psychotic symptoms in the course of recurrent depressive disorder, according to The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The family reports showed that in the few months before hospitalization, her mental state was gradually deteriorating. Symptoms such as decreasing mood and psychomotor drive, deterioration of purposeful activity, sleep disorders, difficulty in focusing, and deterioration in cognitive functions, particularly memory disorders, appeared. Three days before admission, the family observed a significant deterioration of the mental state. Additional symptoms began to appear, such as mutism, akinesia, and limited responses to stimuli. According to the family, the intensity of verbal production with delusional content increased. Both the family and the patient on admission denied episodes of mania and hypomania in the past. The analysis of the disease course indicated many years of psychiatric history. The patient was hospitalized twice in the past due to recurrent depressive disorder 17 and 18 years before the present hospitalization. Since her last hospital discharge, she had not experienced any exacerbations of disease symptoms requiring hospital treatment, but she was under constant outpatient psychiatric care. Psychopharmacological therapy prescribed before admission consisted of 45 mg of mirtazapine per day, 20 mg of citalopram per day, and 7.5 mg of zopiclone as needed. For 6 years, she had been under the control of a hematology clinic due to ET. She confirmed the presence of the Jak V617F 12.5\u201331% mutation. Because of this, she was taking 1 mg of anagrelide per day in two divided doses. The last modification of hematological treatment was made 4 months before hospitalization. The patient was also treated for hypertension for many years before hospitalization, and without any changes in the period before hospitalization, she took indapamide at a dose of 1.5 mg per day and 50 mg of metoprolol per day. On admission to the hospital, the current treatment was modified. In the beginning, constantly admitted by the patient before hospitalization, citalopram was reduced and then, within 5 days, was discontinued due to its ineffectiveness in out-of-hospital treatment. Due to psychotic symptoms, haloperidol at a daily dose of 8 mg was added to the treatment, but because of persistent psychotic experiences, it was discontinued on the seventh day Medicina 2022, 58, 626 4 of 8 of hospitalization. Instead, olanzapine was included in the treatment at an initial dose of 5 mg per day to reach a dose of 10 mg after 10 days. Because of the reduction in the intensity of psychotic experiences and persistent depressive symptoms on the 29th day of hospitalization, VEN was added to the current treatment at the initial dose of 37.5 mg. Due to the good clinical response, the dose was increased to 75 mg per day after 5 days. After 10 days, the dose of VEN was increased to 112.5 mg per day, but due to increased anxiety, the dose was reduced to 75 mg after 3 days. After 20 days, the dose was increased again to 112.5 mg per day, and after another 6 days, to 150 mg. After 92 days of VEN treatment, the dose was changed to 225 mg, which was maintained until the end of the observation period. The diagnosis and the medical history were objectified after achieving a relative improvement in the mental state. The patient then admitted to the presence of episodes of hypomania in the past, which, due to the fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria according to ICD-10, resulted in the diagnosis being changed to bipolar disorder. On the 76th day of hospitalization, aripiprazole was added to the treatment at an initial dose of 2.5 mg; after 7 days, the dose was increased to 5 mg per day. During hospitalization, the hypertensive treatment was slightly modified due to persistently high blood pressure values. On day 22, 5 mg of perindopril was added to the treatment, and this dosage was increased to 10 mg per day on day 40. The dosage of anagrelide was not modified throughout the observation period in accordance with the recommendations of the hematologist with whom the patient consulted several times during hospitalization. However, due to his recommendations, the patient\u2019s platelet count was regularly monitored by performing a complete blood count. Since VEN was added to the therapy, a gradual reduction in the number of platelets was observed. The intensity of this reduction was also dependent on the dose of VEN. Detailed changes in platelet count over time and their dependence on VEN dosing are shown in Figure 2.

The case report focuses on the treatment period from the initiation of hospitalization to the 139th day of observation due to reports in the literature that lithium salts can significantly affect the platelet count [24] and interfere with previous observations. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 5 of 8 4. Discussion Thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect that we can observe after administering many drug groups. We can also find many examples of antidepressants that may inhibit the formation of blood platelets or intensify their destruction in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and the spleen, which reduce their number in the blood [25\u201327]. However, one of the most frequently described mechanisms of platelet destruction is the mechanism that supports the increased production of anti-platelet antibodies, which is stimulated by the drugs taken [28]. One of the clinical studies that proved such an effect of antidepressant drugs is a study prepared by Song HR. et al., in which a reduction in platelet count was observed in patients receiving escitalopram or VEN, and such dependence was not observed in patients using bupropion (which belongs to the group of inhibitors of the dopamine and adrenergic receptor) [29]. It is also noteworthy that in this study, there was a stronger correlation between the use of the drug and a decrease in platelet count in the case of escitalopram than in the case of VEN, which may suggest greater importance for the inhibition of serotonergic over noradrenergic transmission. Similar conclusions were drawn from a meta-analysis carried out in 2013, which included a group of 681 patients from two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which the safety of using another SNRI representative, duloxetine, was tested. Conclusions resulting from this meta-analysis show that in the group of patients taking duloxetine compared to the placebo group, a decrease in the number of platelets was observed [30]. The reverse relationship is shown in the study prepared by Gronau W. et al., in which a statistically significant increase in the platelet number after using VEN was visible [31]. Due to the presence of \u000b2-adrenergic and 5HT-2A receptors on the surface of the platelets, it may be assumed that the effects of biogenic amine concentrations, such as NA and 5-HT, will be influenced by the platelet aggregation process. These assumptions were confirmed by an in vitro study conducted in 2012, which showed a statistically significant increase in the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen after using VEN. Nevertheless, in this study, this effect did not result in an extension of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time [32]. Despite the effect of SNRI described in the cited studies, the extent, and activity of platelets, their influence on the risk of bleeding, and the risk of cardiovascular events caused by their overactivity are still very unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the first report on the impact of VEN on the platelet aggregation process dates back to 2006. In the case study prepared by Sarma A. et al. regarding a patient in whom the administration of VEN caused the appearance of ecchymoses, the authors confirmed disorders of platelet aggregation, which they associated with the patient\u2019s intake of VEN [33]. Similar symptoms were later described by Shaligram D. et al. in a patient taking desvenlafaxine [34]. These case reports prompted the researchers to conduct studies on larger groups of patients that assessed this previously unknown effect of SNRIs. In a study conducted on a group of 4136 patients after coronary artery bypass grafting, there was no relationship between patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or SNRI before the procedure and the risk of excessive bleeding during the postoperative period and during longer follow-up. The same study showed a reduction in the risk of cardiac death, which, according to the authors, was probably related to the reduction in platelet activity [35]. Similar conclusions were drawn from a study by Smith MM et al. in a group of 1453 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were taking SSRI or SNRI. An increased risk of bleeding and postoperative mortality was also not observed in the study [36]. A study prepared by Chachal P. et al. also did not reveal an increased risk of bleeding in patients receiving SNRI after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [37]. On the other hand, in a group of patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who used SSRI and SNRI, a statistically significantly more frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed compared to patients not using these drugs [38,39]. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 6 of 8 However, even the authors of this article highlight the important role of antidepressant therapy using SSRI or SNRI in this group of patients [40,41] and are not in favor of stopping it. The case report prepared by us has some limitations. The most important limitation is polypharmacotherapy taken by the patient, which could interfere with the decrease in the number of platelets observed by us. However, to limit the impact of other drugs, in this article, we only present the period when the only modification of the therapy was the intensification of VEN doses. The second limitation is the initial misdiagnosis of MDD with bipolar disorder, which influenced the initial therapeutic decisions. However, this resulted from the patient\u2019s serious condition on admission and from the fact that both the patient and the family denied the occurrence of hypomania episodes in the past. 5. Conclusions Considering the results of scientific studies and the changes in the platelet count observed in the described patient, attention should be paid to the possible adverse effect of reducing the number of platelets in the group of patients taking VEN. Due to the probable mechanisms of this phenomenon, it is an adverse effect seemingly difficult to prevent in the case of chronic therapy. Therefore, ordering frequent complete blood count lab tests in such patients should be justified to detect it as early as possible and consider the further course of treatment. However, this topic requires further research to unambiguously determine the effect of SNRI on platelet count and activity.

ABSTRACT Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used to treat various diseases and has anticancer effects that suppress metastases in animal models of sarcoma and melanoma. However, these effects have been observed in a limited number of clinical cases. We report the case of a patient with metastatic breast cancer in which long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in the absence of salvage chemotherapy. The patient was treated with IVIG for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Surprisingly, the lung and brain metastases were stabilized, and the patient achieved a progression-free interval of 29 months. More cases are needed to investigate and confirm the efficacy of IVIG in solid tumors in the future.

ITP results in autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets in the spleen. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is derived from donor plasma and contains purified immunoglobulin G (IgG). IVIG is used to treat various diseases, including immunodeficiency, as well as autoimmune, systemic inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders [2]. IVIG exhibits anticancer effects that suppress metastases in several animal models [3,4]. However, these effects were observed in a limited number of patients, including a case report and a clinical study of metastatic melanoma [5,6] and a case report of soft tissue sarcoma [7]. Here, we report that long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in a patient with advanced breast cancer with lung and brain metastases in the absence of salvage breast cancer therapy.

(pT1N0M0, stage I; Figure 1). Figure 2 summarizes the entire clinical course, treatment, and response of the patient. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epithelial growth factor receptor were negative. She underwent breast conservation surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil. She received three cycles of chemotherapy, and thrombocytopenia developed after the second cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count,16,000/ \u00b5L) persisted and became refractory to platelet transfusion after the third cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, the patient had severe menorrhagia. As a result, adjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued, and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected. However, the platelet count did not recover to baseline during the 6-month follow-up. Bone marrow biopsy and all pertinent laboratory studies were normal except for a positive antiplatelet antibody test; therefore, a clinical diagnosis of ITP was established. Eltrombopag (25 mg daily), hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and danazol were administered, but the response was limited. Splenectomy was not considered because of the high risk of bleeding. Subsequently, she did not receive any cancer treatment. The patient developed lung metastases with a diameter of 1 cm in the right lower lobe (Figure 3) and tiny subpleural nodules in the right middle lobe 28 months after the operation. Six months later, the patient suffered from severe vertigo, headache, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance  Figure 1. Contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging.

Brain metastases were confirmed radiologically. Whole-brain radiotherapy was administered (14 fractions of 3500 mGy) in March 2019. The sizes of the brain metastases were all regressed (with the largest size of approximately 1.3 cm) (Figure 4B). For refractory ITP and a high risk of bleeding, the patient began to receive IVIGs at a dosage of 0.4 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Her platelet count recovered to approximately 100,000/\u00b5L in subsequent cycles of IVIG therapy. Notably, the lung metastases slightly decreased half a year after the initiation of IVIG (all of them less than 1 cm) (Figure 3). Moreover, in further repeated imaging studies, metastatic breast cancer in the brain and lungs remained stable without new metastatic lesions for 29 months (Figures 3 and 4). No side effects from IVIG therapy were reported, and the patient maintained a normal life. During the course, the patient did not receive palliative chemotherapy or targeted therapy for breast cancer.  DISCUSSION Of all subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer has the worst prognosis and the highest likelihood of recurrence. Published data suggest that metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has a median survival of approximately 1 year [8] and a 5-year survival rate of 12% [9]. This is the first known case of sustained tumor stabilization from IVIG treatment alone in an advanced triple-negative breast cancer patient with lung and brain metastases. Without any anticancer therapy, IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer and metastases in the lungs and brain. This therapy provided a prolonged progressionfree survival time of at least 29 months in our patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This extraordinary outcome suggests that IVIG may be an alternative therapy for breast cancer. Clinical experience with IVIG for patients with cancer is scarce, but beneficial antimetastatic effects have been described in several animal studies [5-7,10]. In mouse models of melanoma and sarcoma, the administration of IVIG significantly inhibited cancer progression and prolonged survival [10]. A similar effect was reported in a mouse model of sarcoma [7]. Recently, Xu et al. [11] demonstrated that low-dose IgG might induce macrophage polarization toward the M1 profile, and it was effective in suppressing tumor progression in mouse models of three cancer types (melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer). https://ejbc.kr  https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8  255  \fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer  A  B  C  D  Figure 4.

The red arrows indicated the metastatic brain lesions. MR = magnetic resonance; IVIG = intravenous immunoglobulin; WBRT = whole brain radiotherapy.  The antimetastatic effects and safety of IVIG have been reported. In one case report, a patient with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor received IVIG (0.4 g/kg) once every 6 weeks for multiple sclerosis and had a stable disease status for 30 months [7]. In another case report, a patient with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) experienced liver metastasis regression and stabilization of lung metastases for 9 months [5]. In a third report, nine patients with metastatic melanoma who failed prior chemotherapy and immunotherapy were treated with IVIG therapy (1 g/kg) every 3 weeks [6]. Two of the patients achieved stable disease status for 3 and 8 months, respectively, but the metastases progressed thereafter. To our knowledge, no other clinical reports have illustrated the substantial antimetastatic effect of IVIG therapy on solid tumors. In our case, a patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving only IVIG therapy achieved stable disease status for more than 2 years. This indicates that IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage cancer and has great potential for metastatic solid tumor treatment. https://ejbc.kr  https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8  256  \fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer  The mechanisms by which IVIG inhibits metastasis progression are multifactorial and not fully understood. IVIG may halt tumor progression by inducing tumor cell apoptosis [4,12]. IVIG was observed to enhance the apoptotic gene expression of p53, p21, and pRb in cancer cells and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation [3]. IVIG also induces interleukin-12 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 secretion, which potentiates natural killer cell activity and increases anticancer effects. Antiangiogenic effects and activity against tumor adhesion machinery have also been proposed [10]. IVIG protects the basement membrane and intercellular matrix integrity and prevents cell invasion by decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-9 mRNA expression and protein levels [7]. F(ab')2 fragments from IVIG have an affinity for binding to cancer cells and initiating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [13]. Dom\u00ednguez-Soto et al. observed that the dissemination of tumors depends on tumor-associated macrophages (M2), and IVIG could inhibit this process by modulating cytokines and inducing M2 (protumoral)-to-M1 (antitumoral) polarization [14]. The current study showed that IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer and metastases in the lungs and brain without any anticancer therapy, except for whole-brain radiotherapy. Although whole-brain radiotherapy may have contributed to the progression of brain metastases, it is noteworthy that a previous study reported that the intracranial progression-free duration was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5\u20138.5 months) in patients with multiple brain metastases [15]. Furthermore, the median survival after a diagnosis of brain metastases in patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy was 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.5\u20138.9 months) [16]. In another retrospective study, the median survival for patients with brain metastases who received whole-brain radiotherapy was 4.2 months [17]. Consequently, the improved survival might not be entirely attributable to wholebrain radiotherapy. It is possible that both IVIG and whole-brain radiotherapy provided a synergistic or additive effect on the stabilization of brain metastases. The effect of IVIG therapy and radiation therapy on brain metastases should be considered in further long-term follow-up studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In conclusion, we report the first case of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and brain that was incidentally stabilized by IVIG treatment. The administration of IVIG may play a role in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis with few side effects in patients with solid tumors.  REFERENCES 1. Kistangari G, McCrae KR.

ABSTRACT Background/Significance: Catatonia is common in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis (Espinola-Nadurille, 2019). The glutamate NMDAR antagonists amantadine and memantine are effective in catatonia (Beach, 2017), but data on their use in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is limited. We describe three patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis treated with NMDAR antagonists and propose a possible mechanism underlying differential outcomes. Case 1: A 20-year-old woman presented with catatonic symptoms after successful treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with immunotherapy and salpingo-oopherectomy for ovarian teratoma. Initial Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score was 22. Lorazepam 2.5 mg three times daily was partially effective, but increased doses caused sedation. Memantine was titrated to 10 mg twice daily with complete resolution of catatonia over two weeks. Case 2: A 26-year-old woman presented with catatonic with BFCRS score of 25, after successful immunotherapy for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Lorazepam 2 mg four times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused respiratory depression. Memantine 10 mg daily resulted in further improvement. Lorazepam titration to 4 mg four times daily was then possible, with complete resolution of catatonia over two weeks. Case 3: A 31-year-old woman with anti-NMDAR encephalitis presented with catatonic symptoms with BFCRS score of 22, after a hospital course significant for limited response to immunotherapy with persistently elevated serum anti-NMDAR antibody titers. Lorazepam 2 mg three times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused sedation. Both amantadine 100 mg twice daily and memantine 10 mg were trialed but were discontinued due to agitation. Mutism and negativism persisted, with a discharge BFCRS score of 12. Discussion: Memantine was effective for catatonia and well tolerated in two patients with successfully treated anti-NMDAR encephalitis, but both amantadine and memantine caused agitation in a third patient with active disease. NMDARs are reversibly internalized in the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies, leading to a compensatory increase in downstream glutamatergic tone. We hypothesize that NMDAR reemergence after successful treatment, in the context of excess extracellular glutamate, creates a state of excitotoxicity contributing to catatonic signs for which NMDAR blockade can be effective. In the third case, where NMDARs presumably remained internalized in the presence of persistent anti-NMDAR antibodies and a state of NMDAR hypofunction persisted, further NMDAR blockade caused clinical worsening. Conclusion/Implications: NMDAR antagonists can be safe and effective in patients with residual catatonia following successful treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis but may be less useful during active disease. More work is needed to clarify best practices for patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis. References: 1. Espinola-Nadurille M, Flores-Rivera J, Rivas-Alonso V, et al.

In the present research, we reported an acute myeloid leukemia subject. The patient was treated with Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6, and Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3. During treatment, the patient suffered from 3 life-threatening complications caused by chemotherapy drugs include sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), refractory thrombocytopenia, and pericardial effusion with pericardiocentesis limitation. To this end, we tried three novel approaches for patient management by Corticosteroid and Colchicine. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective in thrombocytopenia. However, eltrombopag (25 mg/kg/d) response was dramatic. Moreover, pericardial effusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed with Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d); meanwhile, the massive pericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed with Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) through the mentioned treatment. Fortunately, these approaches were effective and life-saving.

Received: September 08, 2020; Accepted: March 08, 2022  AML is treated via a highly potent chemotherapy regimen with severe complications. Its treatment complications could affect the main organs, including bone marrow, heart, liver, and kidney. The limitation of access to new drugs, in other words,  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  their unavailability in low- or middle-income countries, is known to be a challenge for pediatric oncologists.2 Critical conditions, such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, steatosis, and pseudocirrhosis, are more commonly associated with chemotherapy. It is important to anticipate and recognize these adverse effects so that appropriate clinical measures could be taken. Patients with these liver manifestations can be normally managed with supportive therapies and Defibrotide. Liver toxicity may also be resolved after discontinuation of chemotherapy. 3 Defibrotide is unavailable in Iran. Refractory thrombocytopenia limits many invasive procedures in oncologic patients, such as surgical operation or biopsy and other therapeutic or diagnostic actions. In this article, we solved three challenges of treatment employing new alternative treatment options.  Case Presentation Our subject was a four year-old male patient from Iran presenting pancytopenia, who was admitted to Shahid Madani hospital (Khoramabad in Lorestan province/Iran). There was no history of any hematological disorders. On examination, the patient had pallor and mild splenic enlargement, measuring 1.5 cm on the left below  the costal margin. Lymphadenopathy or any abnormal physical findings were unremarkable. The patient had been suffering from prolonged fever and nocturnal sweats along with weakness and fatigue. Morphology and immunophenotyping peripheral blood cells were examined with an automated hematologic analyzer (Sysmex, XE-5000, Vienna, Austria). Peripheral blood smear examination showed normocytic normochromic red blood cells, including a few nucleated red blood cells. White blood cells showed shift to the left with a significant number of myeloid blast cells. Several giant platelets and platelet aggregates were seen. The leukocyte differential count was eosinophils 3%, lymphocytes 70%, and neutrophils 27%, and band forms 1%. Coagulation tests indicated a prolonged prothrombin time of 16.3 sec (reference range, 10.2 to 13.8), a normal activated partial Thromboplastin time, normal fibrinogen, and an increased D-dimer concentration of 4.96 mg/mL (reference range, 0 to 0.35). Bone marrow smears were stained with Wright-Giemsa and analyzed according to the routine clinical laboratory procedures. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed an increased abnormal megakaryocytic. Monolobated and multinucleated megakaryocytic with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei were  Figure 1. Left side shows myeloblast in peripheral blood in Wright-Giemsa staining (\u00d7 100) and right side (\u00d7 10).  557  Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  also seen, which showed that the myeloblast cells (Figure 1) were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34, CD14, CD71, CD117, MPO, HLA-DR, CD3, CD15, CD235a, and human leukocyte antigenDR. The biochemical parameters, namely uric acid, bilirubin, creatinine, and liver enzymes, were normal. Serum LDH was highly increased. The diagnosis was confirmed as AML-M4. Cytogenetic study of bone marrow myeloblasts showed t (8,21). The patient was critically ill due to a high pulmonary pressure and respiratory distress. First echocardiography showed a high pulmonary pressure and a small amount of pericardial effusion. Lasix and Sildenafil were started for the patient. Based on this diagnosis and concerning the patient\u2019s severely compromised overall condition, we started the therapy with Dutch-Belgian pediatric AML protocol for children with newly diagnosed AML: First course: Ara-C Idarubicin Etoposide Thioguanin (AIET) induction 6-Thioguanin 100 mg/m2 orally every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 3, 4. Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4; Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4; Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6;  Triple intrathecal with Ara-C and MTX and Hydrocortisone was injected based on ageadjusted instruction. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Second course: Ara-C Mitoxantrone (AM) induction Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day as continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3; Triple intrathecal injection similar to the first induction course. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Consolidation therapy Cytarabine 2 g/m2 every 12 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3 (a total of six doses); Etoposide 100 mg/m 2 as a 60-minute IV infusion on days 2, 3, 4, 5; Triple intrathecal injection similar to the first and second induction courses. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Following the first chemotherapy course, the patient was involved in refractory thrombocytopenia. Frequent infusion of the random donor or single donor apheresis platelets were done, but platelet count was sometimes greater than 20000. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective. After the second chemotherapy course, we treated him with eltrombopag (EP) (25 mg/kg/d). Furthermore, following the initiation of  Figure 2. Left side shows cardiomegaly due to pericardial effusion and right side shows decreasing effusion after prednisolone and Colchicine.  Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  558  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  chemotherapy, in every course, the patient was involved in pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed via Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d). Nevertheless, massive pericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed using Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) with the mentioned treatment (Figure 2). After the third chemotherapy courses, the total and direct bilirubin increased, but transaminases were normal. Moderate Pitting edema and ascites were found in the patient. The liver looked large on examination. Serum albumin ranged from 2.5 to 3.5. Hepatic color Doppler sonography was normal. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) were suggested based on Baltimore criteria, but the liver biopsy was not done. The morning after the initiation of HDMT (Day +13), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were elevated to 459 U/L, 199 U/L, and 2.4 g/dL, respectively. Prothrombin time was further prolonged (16.5 seconds; INR=1.56). BUN was 3 mg/dL and Cr 0.4 mg/ dL. On the morning of Day +14, serum AST, ALT, total bilirubin, BUN, and Cr were 1108 U/L, 489 U/L, 2.9 g/ dL, 5 mg/dL, and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively. By Day +15, serum AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin had risen to 1494 U/L, 781 U/L, 3.4 g/dL, and 1.51 g/dL, respectively. Thereafter, the patient\u2019s condition improved gradually. One week later (Day +20), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin returned to 91 U/L, 197 U/L, and 1.4 g/dL, respectively. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Defibrotide is the standard treatment for hepatic VOD; however, this drug was not available in Iran. We treated him with an alternative protocol as follows: Methyl prednisolone pulse (30 mg/kg/d for three days) and UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) The Ethics Committee of the Lorestan University of Medical Sciences approved the present case presentation (Ethics Code: IR.LUMS.REC.1400.304). Written informed consent was received from the patient. 559  Discussion Cytoreductive chemotherapy regimen in AML causes certain life-threatening complications, such as refractory thrombocytopenia, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and cardiovascular problems. Therefore, using the classic treatment of these challenges face limitations in the Iranian AML patients. Defibrotide is believed to be one of effective drugs for SOS, which is not available in Iran. Moreover, the use of eltrombopag in AML patients is accompanied with a high risk of disease progression. Thrombocytopenia in AML is a life-threatening problem with a few treatment options. Platelet transfusions are limited by alloimmunization. Frequent transfusion of ABO-mismatched platelets leads to early platelet refractoriness. ABO-mismatched platelets are as effective as matched platelets in patients with low-titer isoagglutinins, such as oncologic patients or those requiring only a few transfusions. However, the greater incidence of early refractoriness induced in major mismatched group (MMG) patients indicates that ABO-mismatched platelets should not be given to patients with marrow failure requiring a long-term support.4 Concerning our patient, ABO-mismatched platelet was probably transfused due to the situation. Furthermore, Rituximab, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are new treatment strategies for severe HLA alloimmune platelet refractoriness. These options can overcome severe platelet refractoriness owing to polyspecific HLA alloimmunization.5 Our patient received IVIg without any response. We did not have any time for weekly Rituximab efficacy. EP is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which increases platelet counts and has preclinical antileukemic activity. In 2015, multi-center, randomized, placebocontrolled, trial patients aged 18 years or older, received EP doses up to 300 mg on a daily basis. There was an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.6 The treatment with EP results in a reduction in free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  dose-dependent manner. Increased intracellular iron eliminates the antiproliferative and induction effects of EP cell differentiation. Its antileukemic effects have been shown to be mediated by changes in the amount of intracellular iron.7 EP is also a safe and effective therapy for refractory thrombocytopenia after haplo-HSCT.8 It could reduce platelet transfusion requirements in thrombocytopenic patients with advanced MDS and AML. EP might also be a treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS, who are ineligible for other treatments and are not receiving disease-modifying treatment EP as escalated dose from 50 mg daily up to 200 mg daily up to 200 mg daily well-tolerated and has modest responses in heavily treated, predominantly higher-risk MDS patients or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or AML after HMA failure.9 Another use of EP in leukemia settings is in the treatment of severe refractory thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CML),10 and in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) secondary to chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLL).11 Therefore, we did not worry about leukemia relapse during the drug use. We treated our patient with dose 1 mg/kg/d because of the cost of drug. In addition, we utilized Prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/d for a synergistic effect as a synergistic drug. In 2016, a number of newly diagnosed AML patients aged >60 years (yrs) with ECOG scores of 0-2, no active second malignancy, and no evidence of marrow fibrosis at the time of AML diagnosis were treated with anthracycline (daunorubicin at 45_mg/m2 or Idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 x 3 days) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2 \u00d7 7 days). Eltrombopag was administered and started from day 15. This study suggested that eltrombopag can accelerate platelet recovery, potentially reduce platelet transfusions, and increase complete remission rate (CR) in older AML patients.12 Regarding our patient, we did not detect any signs of relapse during eltrombopag administration. Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  Nonetheless, in 2019, Dr. Frey reported that eltrombopag in combination with induction of chemotherapy in patients with AML did not have favorable outcomes.13 Despite this report, we should have used this drug herein since other treatments, such as platelet transfusion and IVIg, were not efficacious. Hepatic VOD, also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), rapidly progresses and involves life-threatening complications that can occur in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation after heavy chemotherapy regimens. K+-sparing diuretic, low protein diet, and non-absorbable oral antibiotics are the general strategies for the management of this situation. Hepatic VOD or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is one of the adverse effects of chemotherapy drugs or severe combined chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy-induced Sinusoidal Injury (CSI) score is a tool used as an immunohistochemical panel consisting of CD34, SMA, and GS. It may serve as an objective marker of chemotherapyinduced sinusoidal injury and could be conducive to diagnosis of this peculiar form of liver injury. Unfortunately, due to severe thrombocytopenia, pediatric gastrointestinal service rejects liver biopsy. Platelet transfusions should be limited as much as possible because repeated platelet transfusion increases the risk of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction. This was not possible in our patient because there was a risk of life-threatening bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia. Properly assessing fluid and electrolyte balance may be difficult due to the accumulation of ascites during SOS. In these cases, aggressive treatment with diuretics should be avoided due to the severe reduction in effective intravascular volume, which is prone to accumulation of sludge in the liver sinusoids. Defibrotide is now the first-line therapy IV during the first 17-21 days.14 However, Defibrotide is not available in Iran and our patient had a life-threatening situation. In 2008, Lun Chen and colleagues reported a case of rhabdomyosarcoma in a 21-month-old 560  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  boy who developed pancytopenia, dyspnea, jaundice, massive ascites, and body weight gain of more than 10% after receiving conventional chemotherapy. Hepatic VOD was diagnosed. He recovered after supportive care and treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone. He was diagnosed with VOD based on the abovementioned findings, and Solumedrol was administered (15 mg/kg, every 12 hours for six doses).15 In addition, the third challenging problem in our patient was the combination of severe thrombocytopenia and masssive pericardial effusion, which required pericardiocentesis, but due to severe thrombocytopenia, needle aspiration was not possible in this patient. Severe thrombocytopenia limited needle aspiration through the pericardium. Therefore, we had to treat our patient with medication. Moreover, there was counterindication concerning ASA and other NSAIDs in our case. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent used to treat gout and Beh\u00c1et's disease. In gout, it is less preferred to NSAIDs or steroids. Some of its other uses include the prevention of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever. Recent studies have reported that it is effective in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. In our patient, we administered a combination of prednisone (2 mg/kg/d) and Colchicine (0.5 mg/d). In 2013, Colchicine was used (at a dose of 0.5 mg) twice daily for 3 months for adult patients with acute pericarditis weighing >70 kg and 0.5 mg once a day for those weighing \u226470 kg. These patients treated with Colchicine added to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy, significantly reduced the rate of incessant or recurrent pericarditis.16 Experience with colchicine in the treatment of malignant pericardial effusion in solid tumors is relatively extensive, but experience with the use of this drug in the management of pericardial effusion due to leukemia is very limited. It is not a routine treatment. Colchicine was administered as an adjunctive therapy after pericardiocentesis and not as a primary treatment. 561  In patients with malignant pericardial effusion who underwent pericardiocentesis, the use of Colchicine was associated with less all-cause mortality and reduced the need for subsequent interventions. In our patient, we only used drug therapy without pericardiocentesis. Colchicine should be frequently administered in patients with adhesions and constriction after initial catheter drainage. Subsequently, the course of high-dose steroid should continue Colchicine for 4 months in order to prevent constriction.17 The concomitant occurrence of sinus obstruction syndrome (SOS) and refractory and severe thrombocytopenia, which requires repeated platelet transfusions, is a challenging and dangerous dilemma for the oncologist because repeated platelet transfusion cause platelets accumulation in the liver to repair sinusoidal cell damage, and these conditions creates critical and dangerous conditions for the patient while receiving myeloablative chemotherapeutic agents caused by SOS. This phenomenon also act as a platelet sequestration place. Endothelial protective therapy or antiplatelet therapy, such as ASA, may be helpful in treating SOS. However, antiplatelet therapy had counterindication in our patient due to severe thrombocytopenia, but the treatment of endothelial inflammation of the liver sinusoids with a steroid pulse could facilitate the management of SOS in the absence of the drug of choice (defibrothyde) and save the patient's life.18 The interaction between Colchicine and platelet function was another challenge in this patient. Colchicine may have a beneficial cardiovascular effect by targeting the platelet-inflammatory axis. Whether targeting this pathway in vivo can offer protection from atherothrombosis without increasing the bleeding risk observed with traditional platelet-directed therapies remains unknown, for which future investigation is required.19  Conclusion In acute myeloid leukemia drugs, the sideeffects are known to be a big challenge for oncologists. In developing countries, the use of Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  alternative therapies in the management of these complications instead of expensive and unattainable drugs is one of the most innovative treatment options for patients. The most important advantage of this solution is its cost-effectiveness and high efficacy. Steroids in various doses, along with Colchicine, have a life-saving role in improving the life-threatening side-effects of drugs in the liver (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome), heart (pericarditis), and bone marrow (transfusion-associated GVHD) of cancer patients.  7.  8.  9.

Email: m1153564@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp An 80-year-old male was referred to our hospital with dyspnea on effort. He had a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 2 years ago, for which he was treated with chemotherapy, including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisolone. His laboratory data included a white blood cell count of 1.9 \u00d7 109/L, a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dl, and a platelet count of 92 \u00d7 109/L. His serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 196 U/L. A bone marrow examination revealed a hypercellular bone mar\u0002row with a blast frequency of 23.4%. The blast cells were positive for both nonspecific esterase and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining (Figure 1). A cytogenetic study of the patient\u2019s bone marrow cells demonstrated the following karyotype: 47,XY, +8, der(10)t(X;10)(p11.2;p11.2)[7]/46,XY[13] (Figure 2). A diagnosis of therapy-related acute myelomonocytic leukemia was made due to his history of chemotherapy-treated lymphoma. Although the patient received two courses of azacitidine monotherapy, it was not effective, and he died 3 months after being diagnosed with leukemia. To the best of our knowledge, only five cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involving a translocation consisting of 10p11 and Xp11 breakpoints have been reported [1\u20135]. Of these, one case demon\u0002strated the t(X;10)(p11;p11) translocation as a sole abnormality [3]. This translocation has never been reported in other solid tumors. Hence, t(X;10)(p11;p11) is considered to be a rare, but recurrent, cyto\u0002genetic aberration in AML. The reported cases have several things in common, that is, they all involved balanced translocations, most of them involved therapy-related leukemia, and all of the patients except one (a 50-year-old [5]) were children.

As for the association between t(X;10)(p11;p11) and the pathogenesis of AML, our case involved der(10)t(X;10)(p11;p11), but lacked der(X)t(X;10)(p11;p11) due to the unbalanced nature of the translocation. Therefore, der(10)t(X;10)(p11;p11), rather than der(X)t(X;10)(p11;p11), is proposed to play a cru\u0002cial role in the leukemogenesis in t(X;10)(p11;p11)-harboring AML.

Along with the pandemic COVID-19 spreads, new clinical challenges have  emerged in the health care settings, among which there is a high risk of secondary  invasive fungal infections with significant mortality. Here, we  report a case of  invasive fungal rhino orbital sinusitis due to the simultaneous co-infection by  Rhizopus oryzae and Lomentospora prolificans, both identified by sequencing,  in a 70-year-old Afghanistanian female with COVID-19. The patient was  subjected to surgical debridement as well as taking liposomal amphotericin B,  voriconazole, and on discharge, her condition was good. As far as we know, this is  the first case of co-infection of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) and  Lomentospora prolificans infection. Multiple fungal co-infections in COVID-19  patients are reviewed. KEYWORDS Lomentospora prolificans, COVID-19, mucormycosis, multiple co-infection, antifungal  susceptibility testing Introduction Most COVID-19 patients present with mild or moderate disease, however, patients with  severe COVID-19, with comorbidities, or those receiving corticosteroid therapy and/or  mechanical ventilation and intensive care, are predisposed to secondary opportunistic fungal  infections (1) with high morbidity and mortality rate. Classical risk factors for invasive fungal  infections in healthcare settings include prolonged neutropenia, hematologic malignancy, bone  marrow, and solid organ transplantation, corticosteroid use, long stay in intensive care units  (ICU), and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (2).

TYPE Case Report PUBLISHED 16 March 2023 DOI 10.3389/fmed.2023.1078970 Erami et al. 10.3389/fmed.2023.1078970 Frontiers in Medicine 02 frontiersin.org Mucormycosis is an uncommon opportunistic life-threatening  aggressive infection in humans and animals that is characterized by  extensive angioinvasion that leads to vessel thrombosis and tissue  necrosis (3), preventing the penetration of immune cells and  antifungal agents to the infection site (4). The infection occurs in  immunocompromised patients especially those with uncontrolled  diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, immunosuppression, hematological  malignancy, and hematopoietic stem cell or solid-organ  transplantation (5). Rhizopus is the most common fungal agent of  human mucormycosis in most case series, followed by Mucor and  Lichtheimia, accounting for 70 to 80% of all mucormycosis cases (6, 7). Infections due to other genera such as Rhizomucor, Apophysomyces,  Saksenaea, Cunninghamella, Cokeromyces, and Syncephalastrum are  very rare (5). Lomentospora prolificans (formerly Scedosporium prolificans) is an  emerging invasive fungal opportunist that affects  immunocompromised patients and even immunocompetent  individuals (8), with a predilection for skin, sinuses, lungs, and central  nervous system (9). The respiratory tract is considered the main route  of entry for lomentosporiosis, but it may also occur via contaminated  catheters (10). The infection is difficult to treat and has a high mortality. There are numerous reports on co-infections of COVID-19 with  fungal pathogens, but the complication of two filamentous fungal  co-infections are rarely reported. As awareness and early diagnosis of  such co-infections are important to initiate appropriate antifungal  therapy and to prevent death (11), here, we report a simultaneous  multiple co-infection by the filamentous fungi Rhizopus oryzae and  Lomentospora prolificans in a COVID-19 patient. To better understand  the clinical characteristics of such infrequent symbiosis between  human fungal pathogens, we  have reviewed the reported  lomentosporiosis and the multiple fungal co-infections in  COVID-19 patients. Case report On 29 November 2021 (day 1), a 70-year-old Afghanistanian  female suspected of COVID-19 was hospitalized at Shahid-Beheshti  Hospital, Kashan, Iran. She had a one-month history of headache,  dizziness, dry cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, myalgia, and severe  weakness. In the physical examination, swelling over the right side of  her face and numbness of the right side of her upper lip, a body  temperature of 36\u00b0C, blood pressure of 90/60mm Hg, respiratory rate  of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% while the  patient was breathing ambient air, were observed. Laboratory  investigations were as followed: fasting blood sugar 76mg/ dL  (70\u2013115mg/dL), hemoglobin A1C 5.6% (Non-diabetic: 4.4\u20136.7%),  sodium 135  mmol/L (135\u2013145mmol/L), potassium 4.1mmol/L  (3.5\u20135.3mmol/L), calcium 8.6mg/dL (8.6\u201310.6mg/dL), blood urea  nitrogen 29mg/dL (7\u201323mg/dL), creatinine 1.4mg/dL (0.4\u20131.5mg/ dL), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 84mm in the 1st h,  hemoglobin 11.6g/dL (11.7\u201315.5g/dL), white cell count 11.7 cells/\u03bcL  (4\u201311 cells/\u03bcL), lymphocyte count 8.1 cells/\u03bcL (18\u201344 cells/\u03bcL), and  C-reactive protein (CRP) 130mg/L (normal <8). Her laboratory blood  analysis revealed lymphopenia and a significant increase in CRP. Blood  and urine cultures for fungi and bacteria were negative.  Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained and  subjected to reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction  (rt-RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 targeting the N and RdRp genes  (Pishtaz Teb, Tehran, Iran) tested by Light Cycler 96 system (Roche,  Germany) (12). The sample was positive with a high viral load (Ct  value=14.84 and 13.30 for the two targets). In computed tomography  (CT) scan of the chest, bilateral ground-glass opacities with a  predominantly peripheral and multilobar location were seen. The  largest infiltrate was found in the base of the left lung with a tendency  to consolidate, and in the right lung, opacities were located mainly in  the upper lobe. Bilateral pleural thickenings were also not reported  (Figure 1A). Since her admission, the patient received atorvastatin (40mg),  levomepromazine (7.5mL), and valacyclovir (500mg). After the CT  scan, and after the positive PCR results, hydroxychloroquine  (400mg/12h), remdesivir (100mg, 6 dosages), azithromycin (500mg/ day), dexamethasone (8mg intravenously/twice daily) and  vancomycin (IV, 1 gr) were added. On day 2, the patient was  transferred to the ICU due to the exacerbation of hypoxia and  respiratory distress and received mechanical ventilation assistance  with orotracheal intubation. Due to the progress of hypoxia and the  increase of inflammatory biomarkers, and the onset of the cytokine  storm, dexamethasone was stopped and methylprednisolone (125mg/ day) was started for 3days. After 3days, the patient developed right  periorbital edema and necrosis of the hard palate, and due to the  recent increased prevalence of CAM among COVID-19 patients in  the hospital, intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (5mg/kg/day) was  started as empirical treatment. CT scans of paranasal sinuses and  orbital demonstrated opacification and air-fluid level in the left  sphenoid sinus, and some anterior ethmoid sinus air cells in the right  septal deviation to the right mucosal thickening in the left maxillary  sinus. According to the mucosal thickening and accumulation of  secretions in paranasal sinuses (Figures 1B,C), the patient underwent  endoscopic sinus and nasal surgery on day 7. Endoscopy revealed  black necrotic lesions and tumefaction localized in the right middle  meatus. Necrotic lesions were mostly found in the maxillary and the  ethmoidal sinuses. Necrotic tissue and a part of its surrounding  healthy tissue were removed by surgery. Although there was not enough evidence that the patient was  immunocompromised, enough immunological tests to understand  her defense status were not performed, therefore, the immunological  status of the patient is unclear. Samples from sinusitis and tissue necrosis were taken and  subjected to direct microscopy using KOH preparation and also to  H&E histopathological examination, and broad aseptate and narrower  septate hyaline hyphae were seen in both of them (Figures 2A,B),  suggestive of proven invasive mucormycosis and hyalohyphomycosis.  Therefore, voriconazole 400mg/12h on the first day and then  200mg/12h were added to the treatment. On day 12, PCR for SARS\u0002CoV-2 was negative, and the same result was obtained again on day  20. Since then, the patient\u2019s respiratory status improved markedly; she  had no fever and the leukocyte count was lower than 11 cells/\u03bcL. On  day 20 and day 23 the patient was discharged from ICU and the  hospital, respectively. The patient began a 6-week course of oral  voriconazole with close clinical and radiological surveillance. She was  followed up for 15weeks, during which her presenting symptoms have  resolved, and is doing well. Tissue samples were cultured on two Sabouraud dextrose agar  (Merck, Germany) plates supplemented with 50mg/L chloramphenicol  with three inoculums on each plate, which resulted in the development  Erami et al. 10.3389/fmed.2023.1078970 Frontiers in Medicine 03 frontiersin.org of two different colonies on both plates. One of the colonies quickly  covered the agar surface with dense growth, was cotton candy-like,  white at first and then gray or yellowish-brown (Figure 3A), and its  reverse was white to pale shades of gray or brown (Figure 3B). In the  microscopic study of the slide culture prepared from the pure isolated  colonies, broad hyphae with no or very few septa, numerous stolons  running among the mycelia, and connecting groups of long  sporangiophores were seen (Figures 3C,D). The other isolated colonies  were cottony or moist and light gray to black (Figure 4A), and the  reverse was gray to black (Figure 4B). The mature colony became dark  gray to black and developed white mycelial tufts over time (Figure 4C).  In slide culture preparation, septate hyphae, conidiogenous cells  (annelids) having a swollen base and elongated neck, and small  clusters of olive to brown, one-celled, smooth, and ovoid with a  slightly narrowed, truncated base conidia at the apex were observed  (Figure 4D). For molecular identification, DNAs of the colonies were  extracted using physical destruction by glass-bead manipulation  followed by phenol-chloroform purification as described previously  (13), and the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was PCR-amplified using the  universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 (14). The PCR products were  purified and Sanger-sequenced by the forward primer (Core Facilities  Laboratory, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran). Based on  NCBI and ISHAM barcoding databases, the isolates were identified as  Rhizopus oryzae and Lomentospora prolificans with 100% sequence  identity. The sequences were deposited in GenBank under the  accession numbers ON220152 and ON220151, respectively. Antifungal susceptibility testing (AFST) was performed for  Rhizopus oryzae and Lomentospora prolificans isolated from the  patient, based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute  (CLSI, M38-A2) method for amphotericin B, isavuconazole,  posaconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, caspofungin  and terbinafine. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)/  minimum effective concentration (MEC) were determined visually  after 24 and 72h of incubation, respectively. Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as the quality control strain. The results of  AFST are seen in Table 1. Discussion This is the first case of COVID-associated mucormycosis (CAM)  co-infection with Lomentospora prolificans during the global  epidemics of SARS-CoV-2. The use of steroids in hospitalized  COVID-19 patients and the associated risk of hyperglycemia lead to  an increased risk for secondary infections such as invasive aspergillosis  and mucormycosis (15). There is an increase in the development of  invasive fungal infections in patients who received corticosteroid  therapy compared to patients who did not receive steroids (16, 17). In  our case, dexamethasone and methylprednisolone were incorporated  into cure protocols for COVID-19 infection. The cumulative dose of  glucocorticoids was 391mg. Muthu et al. reported that the cumulative  glucocorticoid dose is a contributory factor for CAM. Therefore, in  hypoxemic COVID-19 patients, glucocorticoids should be used with  caution (16), and should be  avoided in patients without  hypoxemia (18). Scedosporium spp./Lomentospora spp., and Fusarium spp. are also  emerging rare opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised  individuals with an incidence rate 3\u20138 times lower than the Mucorales  (19). The prognosis of the infections caused by L. prolificans is poor.  L. prolificans can be recognized by direct microscopy and culture,  however, laboratories are not familiar with its morphology. In  addition, in vitro antifungal susceptibility studies confirm that  L. prolificans is intrinsically resistant to current available systemic  antifungal agents (20) and the disease is often refractory to treatment,  yielding high mortality rates of up to 90% (21). It is reported that a  combination of terbinafine with miconazole, voriconazole, or  FIGURE 1 (A) Computed tomography scan of the chest in the case showing bilateral ground-glass opacities with a predominantly peripheral and multilobar  location.

Also, combinations  of voriconazole plus either liposomal amphotericin B or micafungin  are moderately supported. The ESCMID guidelines (2014)  recommended a combination therapy containing voriconazole and  terbinafine for L. prolificans infections (23). In a study, five out of eight  patients with Lomentospora infections, who received the combination  therapy with voriconazole plus at least one other agent (in 4/5 patients  the combination included voriconazole and terbinafine), but no  patients who received monotherapy, survived (24). In our case,  liposomal amphotericin B, voriconazole and surgical debridement  were used, and in surgery not only necrotic tissue but also healthy  surrounding tissue were removed to prevent spreading to other tissues. The epidemiology and outcomes of non-Aspergillus invasive mold  infections in 3years between 2014 to 2017 at a university hospital in  San Diego, California, United States, were reviewed (24), in which  eight cases of Lomentospora prolificans were found, two of them were  mixed with Scedosporium apiospermum and Mucor sp. (24). Also,  Lamaris et al. (25) reported a case of co-infection with Scedosporium and Rhizopus, but no clinical information is available. The global  epidemiological status of lomentosporiosis reported between 2000 to  2018 from more than 74 different countries was reviewed (21), which  56 patients with L. prolificans infection were identified in Australia  (n=14), Japan, the United States (each n=8), Spain (n=7), France,  Germany (each n=5), India, Italy, United  Kingdom (each n=2),  Brazil, Netherlands, and Poland (each n=1). Males (n=32, 57.14%)  were more frequently infected than females, ranging from 42 to  67 years. Three out of 56 were mixed with another mold including  Aspergillus spp., Exserohilum spp., and Scedosporium apiospermum (21). While L. prolificans is considered an emerging pathogen, it is  unknown if it is restricted to some countries in Europe, Australia, and  some Southern states of the USA (11) or if the diagnostic conditions  have influenced the epidemiology. As far as we know this is the first  case of L. prolificans isolated from human specimens in Iran. There are numerous reports on co-infections of COVID-19  with fungal pathogens, but the complication of multiple  filamentous fungal co-infections are rarely reported. As listed in  Table  2, fungus-fungus co-infections were mostly observed as  pulmonary (n = 14, 51.85%) followed by sinusitis and  rhinosinusitis (each n = 3, 10.7%) in which the frequency of  Aspergillus-Mucorales (n = 13, 46.42%) and Aspergillus-Aspergillus (n = 12, 42.85%) coexistence was almost similar. The present case  is the first report of multiple co-infections of R. oryzae and  L. prolificans in COVID-19 patients. We  reviewed 27 cases  (including the present case) of multiple fungal co-infections  published during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only six of the 27  patients were healthy, while the rest were diabetic or had other  underlying systemic illnesses. Males (n = 17, 62.96%) were more  frequently infected than females and the age range was 31\u201382 years  old, mostly 50\u201370 years (n = 20, 74.07%). Most patients were  treated with amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, or  voriconazole; 17 of 27 survived and 10 died among which only  two were previously healthy. The clinical overview of patients with  multiple fungal co-infections in COVID-19 is summarized in  Table 2.

Erami et al. 10.3389/fmed.2023.1078970 Frontiers in Medicine 06 frontiersin.org Conclusion We reported the first case of co-infection of COVID-19-associated  mucormycosis with Lomentospora prolificans infection and reviewed  the multiple fungal co-infections in COVID-19 patients, and also the  cases of lomentosporiosis. Despite frequent prescriptions of broad\u0002spectrum empirical antimicrobials in patients with COVID-19, there  is a paucity of data to support the association with two filamentous  fungal co-infections. Understanding the predictors of co-infection and  multiple infections may help to determine the appropriate interventions  to reduce mortality and morbidity. In addition, the generation of  prospective evidence to support the detection, identification,  development of antimicrobial policy, and appropriate stewardship  interventions specific to the COVID-19 pandemic is required.

Introduction Lidocaine-induced systemic toxicity can occur after admin\u0002istration of an excessive dose, rapid absorption or accidental intravenous injection. Managing local anesthetic (LA) toxicity is challenging, therefore understanding the circum\u0002stances and being prepared for treatment is essential to optimize patient outcomes. We present a case of lidocaine-induced systemic toxicity in a 53-year-old female with congestive heart failure (HF), who underwent an elective insertion of an implantable car\u0002dioverter defibrillator (ICD) as an outpatient. Our aim was to raise awareness among cardiologists of the warning signs of LA toxicity and create an understanding of the pathophysi\u0002ology behind its various clinical manifestations and the use of intravenous lipid infusion as the treatment of choice to reverse symptoms. Case report A 53-year-old female patient with congestive HF, whose pre-procedural echocardiogram revealed an ejection frac\u0002tion of 23% presented for an elective ICD at an outpatient hemodynamic center. She had a history of dilated cardiomy\u0002opathy post myocarditis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease and anxiety. Her outpatient medication was loop diuretics, angiotensin-receptor blockers and a benzodiazepine. She had received fully optimized medical therapy but had sustained HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and thus was referred for elective ICD insertion for the prevention of sudden cardiac death.1 At the pre-procedure assessment, her body weight was 37 kg, her blood pressure (BP) was 85/40 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate (RR) 12 per minute and temperature 36.6 \u25e6C. For the procedure, the patient was monitored with non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and electro\u0002cardiography. She received 2 mg midazolam prior to the procedure and had a Glasgow coma scale of 14. Lidocaine 1% subcutaneous infiltration was used for LA. Initially one ampoule 20 ml of lidocaine 1% (total 200 mg) was admin\u0002istered subcutaneously to enable dissection to create the pocket. Due to sustained patient discomfort during the pro\u0002cedure, additional lidocaine was given, total dose of 60 ml of lidocaine at 1% (3 lidocaine 20 ml ampoules, giving a total of 600 mg). There was a sudden loss of patient response to verbal and painful stimulus; an anaphylactic reaction was suspected, and an anesthesiologist was called for patient evaluation. In the initial evaluation the patient was breathing at room air, with O2 saturation of 99%, with oxygen at 3 L/min, bradypnea with resting rate of 9, normal chest expansion, no audible respiratory signs on auscultation, BP of 70/40 HR 69 and GCS of 3. Initially a bolus of 50 micrograms of adrenaline was given in order to increase cerebral per\u0002fusion pressure with increase of BP to 90/40 HR 97 with no neurological improvement. Local anesthetic toxicity was suspected and intralipid 20% 1.5 ml/kg bolus was given over the course of one minute. The patient became respon\u0002sive with improvement of neurological status to GCS 10 to (O2M5V3). Continuous infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/min was given until complete neurological recovery. The patient was then transferred to an intensive care unit for 24 hours for surveil\u0002lance and was discharged at 48 hours. Discussion Local anesthetics are widely used in daily medical practice. Their mechanism of action is through binding voltage-gated sodium channels, through which they inhibit the propagation of action potential, therefore enabling anesthesia. The main target organs are the central nervous system (CNS) and the cardiovascular system (CVS). Since the CNS is more sensitive to electrophysiological changes than the CVS, the dose that causes CNS symptoms is typically lower than the dose and concentration that results in cardiovascular toxicity. Practitioners who use LA need to be aware of which patients at high risk of toxicity, the early symptoms and signs of LA systemic toxicity, in order to implement preventative measures when using local anesthetics, and the initial mana\u0002gement of systemic toxicity with intravenous lipid emulsion. The most critical aspect of LA is appropriate dosing. The lowest effective dose should be used and patient weight and comorbidities need to be considered when calculating the dose. The maximum recommended dose for subcuta\u0002neous lidocaine without epinephrine is 4.5 mg per kilogram (mg/kg) and for lidocaine with epinephrine, it is 7 mg/kg2 as epinephrine acts by vasoconstricting the vessels at the administration site, thus reducing the absorption rate.3,4 A suitable adrenaline concentration is 5 \u0002g/ml (1:200 000), which reduces the peak plasma concentration of the LA by 30---60%. The choice of the LA is a critical step. Lidocaine has the safest profile and offers the fastest onset but the lowest duration of action. The available preparations are lidocaine 483.e2 Revista Portuguesa de Cardiologia 42 (2023) 483.e1---483.e4 1% (10 mg/ml), lidocaine 2% (20 mg/ml). Lidocaine 2% has, therefore, a lower safety margin when used subcutaneously in highly vascularized areas, such as the anterior thorax. Other available LAs are ropivacaine, levobupivacaine and bupivacaine. These have a slower onset of action but are longer in duration. Awareness of the cardiovascular col\u0002lapse/CNS (CC/CNS) ratio is important. This is the ratio of the LA dose to cause cardiovascular collapse in rela\u0002tion to the drug dose required to produce seizures.5 The lower the ratio, the more potentially hazardous the drug is. Among the commonly used LAs, bupivacaine has the lowest CC/CNS ratio, followed by levobupivacaine, ropiva\u0002caine, and lidocaine.6 LA with a higher CC/CNS ratios has a greater safety margin, as the earlier occurrence of con\u0002vulsions facilitates recognition of LA systemic toxicity and early intervention to prevent progression.7 Although local anesthetics are remarkably safe at ther\u0002apeutic doses, practitioners treating medically complex patients must address the existing systemic diseases that may exacerbate the risk of toxicity from the anesthetic agent, as well as the technique. Any factors that alter LA pharmacodynamics contribute to increasing its plasma concentration and toxicity. Regarding absorption, an injec\u0002tion site close to a highly vascularized area and the use of high pressure while injecting contributes to intravascular installation. It is advisable that when using a subcutaneous infiltration injection technique, frequent aspiration is used prior to injection to ensure there is no intra-vessel adminis\u0002tration as coupled with slow injection rate, it decreases the toxicity risk. Lidocaine is a weak base and is distributed in blood bound by \u00031-acid glycoprotein (AAG). Any condition that leads to low AAG titer results in a higher concentration of free LA. Reduced hepatic and renal function and thus clearance leads to accumulation with repeated doses and infusions. Special care is needed for patients with severe cardiac failure as they are particularly susceptible to LA-induced myocardial depression and arrhythmias. Characteristically systemic low perfusion leaves these patients with slower renal and liver clearance, slowing LA metabolism and elimi\u0002nation, thus posing the risk of drug accumulation. The use of LA with epinephrine needs be handled with care in patient with ischemic heart disease and arrhythmia. In renal dysfunction, AAG is increased in patients with uremia and offers protection against systemic toxicity. Nev\u0002ertheless, LA clearance is lower therefore the LA dose should be reduced by 10---20%.8 Patients with severe liver dysfunction often have other concomitant diseases such as renal and cardiac. Single\u0002dose LA can be administered without dose reduction in liver dysfunction. However, in repeat blocks, it needs to be reduced by 10---50%. Elderly patients frequently have multiple co-morbidities altering LA pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and there is a reduction in nerve mor\u0002phology. In combination, all these factors suggest there is a benefit, in terms of safety, of dose reduction without redu\u0002cing clinical efficacy. Initial subjective symptoms of CNS toxicity include signs of excitation, such as lightheadedness and dizziness, tinni\u0002tus, confusion, and peri oral numbness. The objective signs of LA toxicity are excitatory, including shivering, myoclonus, tremors, and sudden muscular contractions. As the LA level rises, tonic-clonic convulsions occur. Symptoms of CNS exci\u0002tation typically are followed by signs of CNS depression and ultimately respiratory depression and respiratory arrest. In the concomitant presence of other CNS depressant drugs, such as benzodiazepines, CNS depression can develop with\u0002out the preceding excitatory symptoms. Where there are higher plasmatic doses, CVS manifesta\u0002tions can occur such as rhythm changes, including a variety of arrhythmia presentations and negative inotropic effects and vasodilatation leading to a cardiovascular collapse. LA-induced cardiac toxicity is particularly resistant to treatment, and advance life support (ALS) efforts should be prolonged up to one hour.9,10 A diagnosis of LA systemic toxicity is usually clinical as serum levels are not readily available and they do not guide or change treatment. Once a patient develops symptoms of systemic toxicity, the only therapy that prevents death is lipid infusion. 20% lipid infusion is the first safe intravenous lipid emulsion used in medicine and was primarily use in parenteral nutrition. Intravenous lipid emulsion has been incorporated into safety guidelines over the last decade by anesthetic organizations all over the globe.11,12 The current agreed hypothesis for the efficacy of intra\u0002venous lipid emulsion in treating LA systemic toxicity, supported by in vitro studies, is the formation of an expanded intravascular lipid phase that absorbs the circu\u0002lating lipophilic LA, hence reducing the unbound free LA available to bind to the myocardium.13 The recommended approach from the Association of Anesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland14 for the management of severe LA toxicity involves four steps: (1) Recognition of the CNS symptoms such as sudden alter\u0002ation in mental status, severe agitation or loss of consciousness, with or without tonic-clonic convul\u0002sions as well as signs of cardiovascular collapse: sinus bradycardia, conduction blocks, asystole and ventricu\u0002lar tachyarrhythmias. (2) Immediate management by stopping the injection of LA, calling for help, maintenance of a permeable airway, giving 100% oxygen and ensuring adequate ventilation, confirmation of a patent intravenous access, assessment cardiovascular status, and if present, seizure control with a benzodiazepine or propofol in small incremental doses. If cardiac arrest, start ALS. (3) Treatment of the cause with an initial intravenous bolus injection of 20% lipid emulsion 1.5 ml/kg over 1 min and start an intravenous infusion of 20% lipid emulsion at 0.25 ml/kg/min associated with ALS. If cardiovascu\u0002lar stability has not been restored, a maximum of three boluses can be given (including the initial bolus) with 5 minutes interval. The infusion can be increased up to 0.5 ml/kg/min. Infusion should be continued until patient is stable and adequate circulation is restored. (4) Follow-up in a clinical area with appropriate equipment and suitable staff until sustained recovery is achieved. Exclusion of pancreatitis by regular clinical review, including daily amylase or lipase assays for 48 hours. When there is sudden altered mental status (AMS) during a medical procedure under LA, the physician should evaluate 483.e3 M. Nunes Silva, A. Ferro and I. Fragata the patient in a systemic \u2018\u2018ABCDE\u2019\u2019 approach to check for quickly reversible causes of AMS. Ideally this should happen as the patient is being placed on a monitor and intravenous access is being established. Rapidly reversible causes should be suspected and the patient checked for any causes for the hypoventilation and hypoxic state (hypercapnia, narcotic or benzodiazepine overdose), hypoperfusion state (cardio\u0002genic, hypovolemic, allergic, hemorrhagic), or neurological depressant factors (hypoglycemia, electrolyte disturbances, stroke, toxic effects of medication). Our patient weighed 37 kg and she received 60 ml of 1% solution. This totals 600 mg which is 3.6 times the amount of a recommended dose of 166 mg in her case. The anterior thorax is an area richly vascularized coupled with her low body weight and low ejection fraction caused her to be a high-risk patient for LA systemic toxicity. When such challenging patients for LA infiltration are identified and it is likely to be difficult for them to tolerate the procedure, one of the most effective preventive mea\u0002sure is to refer them to an anesthesiologist for the procedure to be done under sedation or even general anesthesia. Conclusion Systemic lidocaine-induced toxicity can be life threatening. Rapid identification of the clinical symptoms is key to pre\u0002venting death. For safer practice, it is advisable to calculate the highest tolerated patient-tailored dose prior to admin\u0002istration, opting for conservative conduct with LA doses in patients of an advanced age and those with poor cardiac function; to monitor BP HR and neurological status and to communicate with the patient, if feasible. A plan for managing systemic LA-induced toxicity should be established and 20% lipid emulsion should be stocked close to facilities where LA is used for an early infusion and prevention of cardiac toxicity.

Conly1,7,10*\u2020 and Alain Tremblay1,9*\u2020 Abstract Background: Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is completed through  reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) from either oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs, critically important for diag\u2011 nostics but also from an infection control lens. Recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 patients can demon\u2011 strate prolonged viral shedding with immunosuppression as a key risk factor. Case presentation: We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrat\u2011 ing prolonged infectious viral shedding for 189 days with virus cultivability and clinical relapse with an identical strain  based on whole genome sequencing, requiring a multi-modal therapeutic approach. We correlated clinical param\u2011 eters, PCR cycle thresholds and viral culture until eventual resolution. Conclusions: We successfully demonstrate resolution of viral shedding, administration of COVID-19 vaccination and  maintenance of viral clearance. This case highlights implications in the immunosuppressed patient towards infection  prevention and control that should consider those with prolonged viral shedding and may require ancillary testing  to fully elucidate viral activity. Furthermore, this case raises several stimulating questions around complex COVID-19  patients around the role of steroids, efect of antiviral therapies in absence of B-cells, role for vaccination and the  requirement of a multi-modal approach to eventually have successful clearance of the virus.

Background Te coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic  has had a global impact with signifcant morbidity and  mortality. A positive upper respiratory or nasopharyn\u0002geal (NP) swab reverse-transcription polymerase chain  reaction (RT-PCR) molecular amplifcation test is com\u0002monly used to confrm the presence of severe acute res\u0002piratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control (2022) 11:28 Page 2 of 6 Risk factors for severe disease include older age, medical  comorbidities, and immunosuppressed status [1]. Our understanding of COVID-19 has evolved as per\u0002sistence of SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral shedding and  recurrence of PCR positivity after one or more nega\u0002tive samples have been documented in both asympto\u0002matic and symptomatic patients [2]. While RT-PCR is a  rapid and easily accessible tool, limitations include pro\u0002longed positivity in the absence of infectious virus, thus  confounding clinical management around possible re\u0002infection or relapse. Understanding the natural progres\u0002sion of SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral shedding is critical  from both an individual\u2019s management but also for public  health and hospital infection control. Initial studies sug\u0002gest infectivity declines within ten days in immunocom\u0002petent individuals [3]. Immunocompromised patients  (ICPs) represent a unique population whereby prolonged  infectious viral shedding and infectivity may occur with  disease relapse. We present a complex ICP demonstrat\u0002ing protracted infectious viral shedding for 189 days with  three distinct COVID-19 clinical relapses associated with  waxing and waning of positive viral cultures and RT-PCR  cycle threshold (Ct) values. Methods Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected at regular  intervals beginning shortly after admission and tested  by RT-PCR, quantitative culture [4] and whole genome  sequencing (Additional fle  1: Supplementary Material).  Te patient provided informed consent with approval of  the University of Calgary\u2019s Health Research Ethics Board  (no. 20-0444). Case presentation Preceding availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a  58-year-old Caucasian male presented to his primary  care provider with one-week of cough, low-grade fever,  and general malaise. He was diagnosed with follicu\u0002lar lymphoma 10 months prior and received 6 cycles of  chemo-immunotherapy (bendamustine and rituximab),  achieving clinical remission, and received an additional  dose of maintenance rituximab one month prior. An oro\u0002pharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2, but he  did not require hospitalization at that time. Twenty-seven days after the initial positive swab, he  developed hypoxemia prompting hospital admission. Ini\u0002tial NP swab was negative (Fig. 1A) and computed tomog\u0002raphy (CT) imaging demonstrated recurrent ground  glass opacities (Fig.  1B) with bilateral interstitial pneu\u0002monia, compatible with COVID-19. Blood tests revealed  lymphopenia (0.1\u00d7 109 /L, normal: 0.7\u20133.5\u00d7 109 /L) with  increased C-reactive protein (57.0  mg/L, normal: 0.0\u2013 8.0 mg/L) and ferritin (2047 \u03bcg/L, normal: 30\u2013500ug/L).  He improved with dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 10 days.  However due to relapsing hypoxemia and radiographic  progression, a diagnosis of organizing pneumonia as  sequelae of COVID-19 was considered. Bronchoscopy  was declined, and oral prednisone 50 mg daily was initi\u0002ated with a planned dose taper. On day 90, 73 days post admission, following ongoing  reduction of prednisone (10  mg), the patient presented  with new onset of pyrexia and recurrence of hypoxemia.  RT-PCR testing was again positive by NP swab (Fig. 1A,  Ct 18.3). Te patient was re-initiated on dexametha\u0002sone with bronchoscopy performed. Bronchoalveolar  lavage was  both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Ct 18.7) and  culture positive (1.17\u00d7 104  pfu/mL, wild-type G clade)  and negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, other viral  and fungal growth. Transbronchial biopsies (Fig.  1C)  demonstrated active pneumonitis with occasional foci  of organizing pneumonia, and patchy interstitial fbro\u0002sis. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19 relapse  and remdesivir was given (200  mg intravenous loading  dose then 100  mg daily) for 5  days concurrently with  dexamethasone (Fig. 1A). On day 107, there was clinical  improvement with reduction in oxygen requirements to  room air and RT-PCR Ct of 24.4 Subsequent investiga\u0002tions revealed hypogammaglobinemia (IgA 0.48 g/L, IgG  3.29 g/L, IgM 0.05 g/L (normal: 0.6\u20134.2 g/L, 6.8\u201318.0 g/L,  0.4\u20133.00  g/L, respectively), likely secondary to prior  rituximab administration.

Cycle threshold values greater than 40 were  considered negative. B Serial CT scans show multifocal, patchy areas of predominantly ground-glass opacities. The frst CT scan shown (day 92) was  obtained at the time of the second relapse. The subsequent studies (days 118, 132 and 152) were obtained during the third relapse. On each of  the serial scans, some areas of involvement improve while there is worsening in other areas, consistent with migratory opacities. There are features  of organizing pneumonia, which is typical later in the course of COVID-19 pneumonia. C Transbronchial biopsy.

Thornton et al. Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control (2022) 11:28 Page 4 of 6 was discharged home on day 107 with an oral dexameth\u0002asone (4 mg) taper. Viral culture load at time of discharge  was not detectable. On day 118 the patient re-presented to hospital with  respiratory failure. A repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab  was positive with Ct of 23.7and a viral culture load of  1.25\u00d7 101  pfu/mL, suggestive of ongoing viral persistence  and a third COVID-19 relapse (Fig.  1A). SARS-CoV-2  testing failed to demonstrate remdesivir resistance (sup\u0002plementary material). He was re-treated with another  course of remdesivir for 5  days with modest clinical  improvement. Repeat CT scans demonstrated persistent,  migratory bilateral ground glass opacities (Fig. 1B). Sub\u0002sequent medical therapy included bamlanivimab 700 mg  (day 133; one dose), IVIG 75 mg (days 137, 165 and 193;  one dose each) and a third course of remdesivir (day 146;  ten-day course). Te patient demonstrated a gradual  clinical recovery with progressive reduction in oxygen  therapy and eventual negative swab by RT-PCR on day  189. On days 174 and 202, the mRNA-1273 COVID-19  vaccine was administered. On day 202 after initial pres\u0002entation, he was ultimately discharged home with repeat  COVID-19 swabs (days 209 and 224) negative. He has  continued to improve with gradually increasing exercise  tolerance. Notably, whole genome sequencing of the patient\u2019s viral  samples over the duration of the time-period demon\u0002strated an identical sequence belonging to SARS-CoV-2  clade D614G equivalent to the PANGO B.1 lineage viral  strain with a specifc sublineage of B.1.160. A review of  the local epidemiology during this period noted B.1.160  as the 12th highest lineage, accounting for only 1.4%  of the those sequenced from the general population.  Based on the sequencing results, relapse of infection by  an identical virus strain was demonstrated rather than  re-infection with diferent strains. Finally, serology test\u0002ing completed was negative to the nucleocapsid anti\u0002body, however positive for the spike antibody (value of  1515.3AU/mL; positive threshold of>50AU/mL). Discussion and conclusions Cases of prolonged infectious viral shedding are emerg\u0002ing in the literature, including B-cell defciency where  shedding of greater than 100 days has been reported [5,  6]. Te impact of COVID-19 on immune-defcient indi\u0002viduals and optimal treatment is unknown. Reports of  patients post B-cell depletion therapy with spontaneous  clearance of SARS-CoV-2 are known; however, others  undergoing rituximab therapy had severe and prolonged  COVID-19 infections with persistent detectable virus [7]. Tis case adds to emerging literature on COVID-19  relapse and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus  shedding in the ICP. Such individuals may pose important  infection prevention concerns for similar patient popula\u0002tions as they are often cared in clinical settings with other  ICPs and may serve as unrecognized viral reservoirs  for superspreading local transmission. Current CDC  guidelines recommend duration of isolation for severely  immunocompromised COVID-19 patients to be up to 20  days [1]. However, emerging reports have clearly demon\u0002strated prolonged infectious viral shedding far exceeding  this timeframe. In the hospital setting, isolation guide\u0002lines are of critical importance as prolonged infectious  viral shedding poses risk to both patients and healthcare  workers. Emerging data has highlighted the difculty in SARS\u0002CoV-2 eradication in those with blunted immune  responses, prolonged viral shedding, and protracted  clinical courses. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal  antibody that binds to the CD20 molecule on the surface  of B-cells leading to B-cell depletion lasting 6\u20139 months.  Teoretically, the CD20 surface molecule is lost during  B-cell diferentiation into plasma cells, the major source  of circulating immunoglobulins, and efects on immu\u0002noglobulin production after short courses of rituximab  should be a rare event but real-world experience has  demonstrated reduced response to vaccines and reac\u0002tivation of viral infections, such as COVID-19. A recent  retrospective study revealed up to a 45% incidence of  hypogammaglobinemia in rituximab-treated individu\u0002als, persisting up to 42 months, and 4% of patients failing  to recover CD20 cellular function [8]. Na\u00efve B-cells, dis\u0002proportionally depleted by rituximab, are critical to pro\u0002duce neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 [9]. Similarly,  rituximab-treated patients often fail to respond to SARS\u0002CoV2 vaccines, suggesting that B-cells are required not  only for viral clearance during natural infection but also  for adequate responses to vaccination [9]. Treatments including remdesivir and dexamethasone  have shown modest beneft in the general population, but  efcacy is unclear in ICPs. Te use of COVID-19 conva\u0002lescent plasma in severely ICPs due to prior treatment  with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies had early promise  with favourable safety efcacy early in disease course, but  a recent randomized control trial failed to demonstrate  beneft [10]. Similarly, while no strong evidence exists for  use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment  in ICPs, a rational argument for their use in such situa\u0002tions may be made, and in our case resulted in a signif\u0002cant but transient improvement in Ct values. Our study  was unique in utilizing a multimodal therapeutic targeted  approach and successfully allowing vaccination against  COVID-19, while highlighting the profound efect of  rituximab on the B cell lineage. Te patient\u2019s clinical course may also have been  impacted by corticosteroid treatment. While  Thornton et al. Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control (2022) 11:28 Page 5 of 6 dexamethasone can improve mortality in severe COVID\u000219 illness, evidence in immunosuppressed individuals  is lacking. Te development of organizing pneumonia  following COVID-19 illness and associated use of pro\u0002longed courses of corticosteroids have been described  [11], as highlighted in our case with hypoxemia improv\u0002ing with escalating steroid doses. However, despite initial  improvement, additional immunosuppression may have  contributed to prolonged viral replication with eventual  viral clearance coinciding with tapering of corticosteroid  treatment to physiologic doses. Regardless of the mecha\u0002nisms of viral clearance, all anti-viral therapies attempted  provided modest improvement in Ct values and cultivat\u0002able virus, although often with transient efect, highlight\u0002ing the underlying impact of host immune defects. In conclusion, our case describes a prolonged clinical  course with multiple COVID-19 relapses in an immuno\u0002suppressed lymphoma patient caused by the same strain  of SARS-CoV-2. Our fndings have larger implications  towards infection prevention and control guidelines that  should consider prolonged isolation and rigorous follow\u0002up. Use of quantitative PCR that are well validated and  correlated with viral culture titres in parallel with Ct  values may serve as a powerful clinical tool to elucidate  infectious viral shedding, guide treatments, and assess  outcomes. Response to specifc anti-viral treatments may  be seen, but repeated interventions are likely needed due  to relapse while waiting for efects of immunosuppressive  agents such as rituximab to diminish. Te use of corticos\u0002teroids for organizing pneumonia needs to be balanced  carefully with the risk of compounding pre-existing  immunosuppression.

Sasmith R. Menakuru *, Mona Atta, Vijaypal S. Dhillon and Ahmed Salih Department of Internal Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Muncie, IN 47306, USA * Correspondence: smenakur@iu.edu Abstract: Androgen usage has widely increased in recent times via prescribed and unprescribed means. Testosterone is a popular androgen taken by both athletes and the general population. While there is some evidence of androgens being thrombogenic, we report on a 19-year-old male who presented to the hospital after the usage of testosterone for one month, leading to the development of multiple pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis. The authors hope to elucidate the relationship between testosterone usage and thrombosis formation. Keywords: pulmonary embolism; testosterone; deep vein thrombosis; androgens 1. Introduction Androgens are utilized by bodybuilders and nonathletes alike to increase muscle mass, improve performance, and enhance physical appearance. Androgen use has spread from the realm of competitive sports to everyday individuals wanting to gain a competitive edge. Unfortunately, this practice has not been without consequences. The usage of androgenic steroids poses a serious global health concern in current times. In a meta-analysis of 187 studies, the prevalence of usage was 3.3% and was higher in males (6.4%) compared to females (1.6%) [1]. The study also revealed that usage was higher among recreational athletes than professional athletes (18.4% compared to 13.3% respectively) [1]. In the United States, the average age of androgen usage is in the early 20s, and it is estimated that at least one million men have experienced dependence on androgens [2]. Studies by Buckman et al. and Ip et al. found that individuals who were dependent on androgens were more likely to have coexisting substance abuse and mental health disorders [3,4]. The clinical impact of androgen therapy is multifold, beginning with the unsafe means of accessing steroids. People who use androgens may obtain products from the Internet or via illegal means. The unsafe means of access include obtaining steroids via laboratories, prescribed steroids meant for other individuals, and obtaining those intended for veterinary purposes. The method of steroid administration varies among users. Athletes who use the drugs will typically use them in two different patterns known as pyramiding (taking the steroid in escalating doses) and/or stacking (combining two or more steroids) [5]. Some users may take additional medications to counteract the side effects of steroid use. These include human growth hormones used to counteract a reduction in testicular size, aromatase inhibitors to prevent gynecomastia, and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors to prevent balding [6]. Multiple types of androgens are utilized, including testosterone esters (enanthate and cypionate, taken by injection), 17-alpha-alkylated androgens (known as androgen-anabolic steroids (AAS), such as oral stanozolol or parenteral nandrolone), and androgen precursors (androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone). The most commonly utilized androgens are testosterone, trenbolone, and a veterinary steroid called boldenone [6]. Additionally, selective androgen receptor modulators are nonsteroidal drugs developed to increase binding at androgen receptors in certain tissues, such as muscles. These compounds have not been approved by any country; however, they are widely available on the Internet. Hematol. Rep. 2023, 15, 290\u2013297. https://doi.org/10.3390/hematolrep15020029 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/hematolrep Hematol. Rep. 2023, 15 291 Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a seemingly unrelated condition that occurs at a rate of over ten million cases per year, with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. PE has a mortality rate of more than 15% in the first 3 months following diagnosis [7]. The incidence of PE is higher in males compared to females and much higher in the elderly above the age of 75 [8]. The common presenting symptoms of PE are tachycardia, dyspnea, calf pain due to associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT), syncope, pleuritic chest pain, and cough with hemoptysis [9]. Wells criteria and the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) are tools utilized to determine the pretest probability of patients with PEs. D-dimer elevation can also point towards the possibility of PE or DVT because it is a breakdown product of blood clotting. If the pretest probability is high, the evaluation of a PE should be performed by utilizing computed tomography pulmonary angiography or a ventilation-perfusion scan, which is preferred in patients with elevated creatinine. Patients with a high pretest probability should be provided supplemental oxygen and stabilized. After a diagnosis is made via imaging, anticoagulation should be started. Heparin is the treatment of choice in a hospital setting. Patients can be discharged on warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants such as apixaban. In patients with life-threatening PEs, reperfusion therapy via thrombolysis or embolectomy is performed with consideration of the patient\u2019s bleeding risk [10]. In patients with unprovoked PE or those with increased risk factors, anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely [10]. There have been several case reports in which patients who were taking androgenic steroids developed pulmonary embolisms, but the relationship is still poorly defined [11\u201313]. The typical risk factors for PE and DVTs are advanced age, malignancy, pregnancy, venous stasis, obesity, and heritable hypercoagulation disorders. The typical adverse effects of androgens have been well documented, including liver toxicity, polycythemia, cardiac dys\u0002function, psychiatric symptoms, acne, testicular atrophy, and gynecomastia [2]. Here, the authors report a case of a 19-year-old male who had been taking intramuscular testosterone for one month, which was obtained via illicit means to gain muscle mass. The patient presented complaints of shortness of breath, tachycardia, and calf pain to the hospital and was subsequently found to have multiple pulmonary emboli and a deep vein thrombosis. The authors hope that this case informs clinicians and athletes about the possible side effects of exogenous androgen use. 2. Case Report A 19-year-old male with no past medical history presented complaints of shortness of breath, fatigue, and severe calf pain to the emergency department. He had a muscular build and said that he was a mixed martial arts fighter who was training diligently for an upcoming tournament. He denied the use of any medications, either prescribed or over the counter. He denied any travel history, trauma, recent surgeries, prolonged immobilization, sick contacts, or any significant family history. Routine laboratory investigations were performed, and an immediate CTPA was taken. An electrocardiogram was also performed, which revealed sinus tachycardia. The CT demonstrated extensive segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli throughout all lobes of the lungs. There were also findings of pulmonary arterial hy\u0002pertension and right heart strain. Bilateral upper lobe perihilar nodular consolidations with surrounding ground glass attenuation favoring pulmonary infarcts were observed (Figures 1 and 2). A Doppler of the patient\u2019s left lower extremity revealed deep vein throm\u0002bosis (DVT) in the peroneal vein. Given his findings of multiple PEs and a DVT, he was started on a continuous heparin infusion. Hematol. Rep. 2023, 15 292 Hematol.

He had a D-dimer  of 3235 ng/mL (<500), ferritin of 494 ng/mL (24\u2013336), and erythropoietin of 117.4 mIU/mL  (4\u201326), but all other values were within normal limits. His prothrombin time (PT) was 12.0  s (11\u201313.5), his international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.07 (<1.1), and his activated par\u0002tial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 30.4 s (21\u201335). Results were negative for factor V Lei\u0002den, antiphospholipid antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, protein C, protein S, and factor  VIII, and he did not have an antithrombin deficiency. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene testing  to rule out polycythemia vera was also negative. Due to his young age, with no significant  past medical history, no oncological risk factors, and no smoking history, the overall risk  of malignancy was determined to be low. In addition, the patient did not have any under\u0002lying cardiopulmonary or renal disease.  Upon examination, the patient appeared muscular in build; however, he had gyne\u0002comastia. Apart from tachycardia, other exam findings were benign, including non-en\u0002larged lymph nodes. When the patient was asked if he was taking any supplements, he  was initially adamant in denying the use of performance-enhancing drugs. However, after  admission, he asked to speak with his physician team again, at which point he admitted  to using intramuscular testosterone that he had acquired illicitly while abroad.  Figure 1.

Discussion Testosterone and other androgen usage have increased in the 21st century due to widespread use ranging from athletes to adolescents with the aim of increasing athleticism and muscularity [14,15]. As this practice continues to grow in popularity, clinicians should be aware of the potential side effects of steroid use. In current clinical practice, androgens are utilized in males with primary hypogonadism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, androgen deficiency, and postpubertal cryptorchidism. In females, androgens can be utilized in the treatment of breast cancer, endometriosis, postpartum breast pain, and Hematol. Rep. 2023, 15 294 fibrocystic breast disease. In both males and females, androgens can be utilized in hereditary angioedema, bone pain due to osteoporosis, human immunodeficiency virus wasting syndrome, muscular dystrophy, and to promote weight gain after illness. The use of testosterone and other androgens has been found to cause polycythemia due to the stimulation of erythropoiesis, as observed in the current case. Erythrocytosis and polycythemia can be used interchangeably, and they are defined by an increase in the absolute red blood cell mass in the body [16]. Polycythemia leads to increased blood viscosity, which can have negative outcomes such as increased thromboembolic risk and major adverse cardiac events. However, there is less evidence of the adverse effects of polycythemia due to testosterone therapy [17]. Studies have shown that polycythemia may also have systemic effects on venous return and cardiac function [18]. Testosterone-induced polycythemia must be differentiated from polycythemia vera, which can be performed by first checking an EPO level. If the EPO level is high, then secondary causes of polycythemia should be looked for; however, if levels are low, JAK2 mutation testing should be performed. If JAK2 is positive, then polycythemia vera can be considered, but if it is negative, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy can be carried out. There are multiple proposed hypotheses as to how polycythemia occurs with the use of testosterone. Initially, it was thought to be caused solely by the stimulation of erythropoietin (EPO) production by the kidneys. However, several recent studies have disproved this, including one by Maggio et al., which showed that people who took testosterone had an increase in hemoglobin without a significant elevation of EPO [19]. Therefore, there is growing evidence that erythrocytosis is due to a multifactorial process. Bachman et al. suspected that the mechanism of erythrocytosis was due to the suppression of hepcidin and ferritin, leading to increased iron absorption, transport, and subsequent erythropoiesis [20]. Bachman et al. further researched this and proposed that testosterone stimulates EPO transiently and suppresses hepcidin, creating a new EPO set point at a higher level than one set at the physiologic hemoglobin [20]. The authors have concluded that the red cell mass was increased by testosterone via the inhibition of BMP-Smad signaling in hepatocytes, leading to the suppression of hepcidin. Testosterone stimulates the renal secretion of EPO, stimulating erythropoiesis, which then further suppresses hepcidin. This, in turn, causes a cascade of upregulation of GATA-1 (erythroid transcription factor) and GATA-dependent genes, which may increase EPO sensitivity and stimulate stress erythropoiesis [21]. Estradiol, a breakdown product of testosterone via aromatase, is also thought to be a cause of polycythemia. A study conducted by Calado et al. found that estradiol increased hematopoietic telomerase [22]. In patients taking testosterone, its breakdown would lead to increased estradiol and increased telomerase, leading to increased hematopoietic proliferation [23]. A study carried out by Ory et al. showed that men who were on testosterone therapy and developed secondary polycythemia had a higher risk of major cardiac adverse events and venous thromboembolism during the first year of therapy [24]. A literature review per\u0002formed by Jones Jr. et al. revealed that men who were undergoing testosterone replacement therapy had a 315% increased risk of the development of erythrocytosis as compared to the control group, but the investigation of its association with VTE was inconclusive [23]. In a review conducted by Ohlander et al., there was evidence that short-acting injectable for\u0002mulations of testosterone led to the highest incidence of erythrocytosis, and the associated high blood viscosity increased the potential for vascular complications [25]. In a study of transgender men using testosterone by Madsen et al., it was found that erythrocytosis was common, with a particularly increased occurrence in individuals who used tobacco [26]. There was also an increase associated in transgender men with an increased body mass index, and in those who injected testosterone [26]. Another study conducted by Martinez et al. with a case\u2013control study of 928,745 patients showed a significantly increased inci\u0002dence rate of venous thromboembolism within the first six months of testosterone therapy in men without a prior history of thromboembolic risk [27]. Hematol. Rep. 2023, 15 295 The other mechanism by which testosterone and other androgens could possibly lead to thrombogenesis is through platelet activity; however, current data on this is sparse. In a study conducted by Ajayi et al., there was a demonstration of testosterone-increasing thromboxane A2 (TxA2), which acts through membrane surface receptors to aggregate platelets and constrict vascular smooth muscle in both in vitro and in vivo studies [28]. Ajayi et al. found that the peak level of TXA2 was noted four weeks after testosterone treatment and would return to baseline in the eighth week; this increase in platelet density was statistically significant [28]. A study conducted by Banerjee et al., comparing the effects of testosterone on healthy male and female volunteers, concluded an increase in ADP-2, decreased platelet nitric oxide, and increased platelet TxA2 synthesis only in male volunteers [29]. Exogenous androgens lead to platelet activation and aggregation via the enhancement of platelet cyclooxygenase activity, an increase in platelet TxA2 receptor density and synthesis, an increase in platelet-activating factor, and a decrease in platelet nitric oxide level [30]. Polycythemia in patients utilizing testosterone therapy may be observed with in\u0002creases in hematocrit after one month of therapy and further increases in a dose-dependent fashion [31]. The side effects of polycythemia are due to hyperviscosity and include blurry vision, paresthesia, fatigue, and headaches, the most significant of which is thrombosis [32]. Studies by Basaria et al. [33], Finkle et al. [34], and Vigen et al. [35] all found there was a higher risk of major cardiac adverse events with testosterone, which prompted the FDA to issue a label change to reflect increased risks of myocardial infarction and stroke for patients taking testosterone. Considering the aforementioned studies, the DVT and multiple PEs occurring in the current case were likely multifactorial\u2014as a result of decreased hepcidin, the stimulation of platelets through TXA2, increased estradiol, and increased EPO\u2014leading to polycythemia and consequent thrombosis. Currently, there is no data to support the need for prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with secondary erythrocytosis due to testosterone. In patients presenting with polycythemia secondary to the use of testosterone, reducing the dose of testosterone or utilizing phlebotomy may be implemented. Patients with an essential need for testosterone and thrombosis would require anticoagulation. The authors of this case hope that there will be further research on the effects of testosterone therapy on thrombosis, given the increase in usage via both prescribed and illicit means. In patients with unexplained thrombosis, the possibility of using testosterone or other androgens cannot be excluded.

Memunatu Kamara and Grace Branjerdporn* Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia The following paper described two cases of patients with catatonic depression in bipolar disorder (BD) referred to our electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) service. Both were deemed not medically fit for ECT, and were, instead, treated with intravenous (IV) ketamine. Both responded with a resolution of symptoms, returning to baseline level of functioning. During the COVID-19 pandemic, given the risks associated with providing ECT (an aerosol generating procedure) and, in the context of limited resources, ketamine therapy for catatonia is a potentially beneficial alternative or supportive treatment to ECT that merits additional research. KEYWORDS ketamine, catatonia, COVID-19, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), depression, bipolar disorder 1. Introduction Catatonia is a severe but treatable neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a number of distinctive psychomotor disturbances, including mutism, stupor, immobility, excessive motor activity, echolalia or echopraxia (1, 2). Currently, the gold standard of treatment for catatonia is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), with an efficacy rate of 80 \u2013 100% (2, 3). The COVID-19 pandemic presented a number of new and unique challenges regarding infection control and safety when delivering ECT. Bag-mask ventilation during ECT produces aerosolization of respiratory secretions that pose a high risk of disease transmission during the outbreak of a contagious, airborne virus (4). Clinicians have attempted to overcome these issues in a number of ways; using adjusted PPE protocols, or delaying and reducing ECT treatments (5, 6). Patients may also be considered medically unfit to receive ECT, and alternative treatments for catatonia must be delivered. In recent years, the fast-acting anesthetic, ketamine, has been given wider use in psychiatric pharmacology. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, believed to work by acting on abnormal NMDA signaling and elevated glutamate often observed in major depressive disorder (MDD) and BD (7). A number of studies have found that low dose infusions (0.5 mg/kg) of ketamine significantly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidality in treatment resistant depression (8, 9). These effects have a rapid onset and are maintained for a number of days (10). Increased infusion rates have been observed to increase the response and duration of antidepressant activity (9). Frontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org fpsyt-14-1138772 April 11, 2023 Time: 6:26 # 2 Sarma et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1138772 Originally considered a catatonia-inducing drug, recent advances in knowledge around the role of glutamate and NMDA receptor activity in catatonia have pointed to ketamine as a promising treatment (11). However, few studies to date have investigated its use in catatonia. Only two case studies have been published that describe the use of ketamine in catatonic subjects; both presenting promising findings (11, 12). The current paper presents the case studies of two patients with bipolar disorder (BD) presenting with catatonic depression, describing their successful treatment with ketamine. 2. Case presentation 2.1. Case 1 2.1.1. Chief complaints The patient, an 81-year-old woman with BD, presented with depressive catatonia associated with stupor, mutism, and extreme negativism. 2.1.2. History of present illness Her family described a 3-month history of worsening mood, characterized by social withdrawal and anhedonia, spending most of her time in her room in bed. This occurred after the patientx decided to stop taking her medications. She reported difficulties falling asleep and early morning wakening, and would lie in bed worrying about how she would get through each day. This was associated with a decreased appetite resulting in a ten-kilogram weight loss. On admission, pressure areas were evident on her sacrum. 2.1.3. Past Psychiatric History She had a long history of BD first diagnosed at age 24 characterized by multiple depressive and several manic episodes, with good inter-episodic functioning, and previous response to ECT when depressed. Her last episode had been 5 years prior. Psychiatric medications were Venlafaxine 150 mg mane, Mirtazapine 30 mg nocte, Sodium Valproate 500 mg nocte, 200 mg mane and Olanzapine 10 mg nocte. 2.1.4. Past medical history Past medical history included diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic stroke, hyperlipidemia, and ischemic heart disease. 2.1.5. Psycho-social history Prior to the current episode, she enjoyed neighborhood strolls with an aid, socializing with family, and playing bingo. She had no cognitive impairment and lived in residential aged care due to poor mobility. 2.1.6. Laboratory examinations Admission investigations were unremarkable [neuroimaging revealed an old posterior right Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) territory infarct, blood investigations were normal including thyroid function tests]. An echo performed revealed severe Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient of 99 mmHg, deeming her medically high-risk for ECT. 2.1.7. Diagnostic assessment and treatment The patient was admitted medically for rehydration and nasogastric (NG) feeding. Venlafaxine XR was increased up to 300 mg daily, Mirtazapine was increased to 60 mg via NG. An IV lorazepam challenge test, titrated up to 3 mg, was administered with no response. A cardiology review was conducted, and the patient was placed on a beta\u0002adrenergic blocking agent. As an alternative treatment to ECT for her severe depression, trial of IV ketamine was commenced. Prior to commencement, Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was 50 and Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFRS) was 18. Ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (40 mg) administered IV over 40 min was delivered twice weekly. 2.1.8. Outcome and follow-up Within 2 h of first treatment, the patient started communicating verbally, expressing an improvement in mood. She received a total of 11 treatments (see Figure 1) and once improvement plateaued (MADRS = 5), ketamine ceased, and she continued on oral antidepressants. Her appetite returned, she expressed improvement in her mood and increased enjoyment -enjoying watching sports on television. She started to engage in physical rehabilitation. She was followed-up in the community for 6 months and remained euthymic and was able to be referred back to her general practitioner (GP) for ongoing management. 2.2. Case 2 2.2.1. Chief complaints The patient, a 76-year-old woman with BD, was admitted with catatonic depression, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturations (80\u2013 90% on room air). 2.2.2. History of present illness The depressive episode commenced 6 weeks prior, triggered by a course of oral steroids following surgical removal of cataracts. The patient started to become more anxious and tearful, losing confidence in mobilizing independently and became withdrawn, remaining in bed. She was no longer enjoying reading or speaking with her friends, and had become mute. There was neurovegetative disturbance with loss of 8 kilograms. She displayed negativism when attempts were made to examine her. 2.2.3. Past psychiatric history The patient had a long history of BD, characterized by brief manic episodes and long depressive episodes with catatonia, which had responded to ECT previously. She was cognitively intact and her inter-episodic functioning was good. The patient\u2019s psychiatric medications were nortriptyline 50 mg nocte, lithium 250 mg bd, and temazepam 10 mg nocte. 2.2.4. Past medical history Past medical history included bronchiectasis, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis requiring a home oxygen concentrator, pulmonary embolus, hypertension, Gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. Frontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org fpsyt-14-1138772 April 11, 2023 Time: 6:26 # 3 Sarma et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1138772 FIGURE 1 Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale and BFRS scores and IV ketamine treatment course. 2.2.5. Psycho-social history The patient was a retired librarian and remained cognitively intact. She was independent with activities of Daily Living (ADLs), enjoyed social outings, and had supportive children. 2.2.6. Further diagnostic work-up Admission investigations revealed a small pulmonary embolus. Despite optimizing her medical condition, she required ongoing supplemental oxygen and NG feeding. 2.2.7. Treatment Despite an IV lorazepam challenge, there was no improvement in the catatonic symptoms and ECT was commenced. At her first ECT treatment, she desaturated significantly, resulting in critical saturation levels and deeming her high risk for further anesthetics. Due to the patient\u2019s pulmonary history and intermittent home oxygen saturation fluctuating around 90%, treatment of the PE was considered unlikely to provide an adequate or timely response in order to recommence her ECT. Treatment of her catatonic depressive symptoms was the priority so a trial of ketamine was commenced. Prior to treatment, her MADRS was 42 and BFCRS was 9. Ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg was administered IV over 40 min twice weekly. 2.2.8. Outcome and follow-up There was a noticeable improvement following the first treatment, with a reduction in agitation, increased reactivity, and improvement in appetite (see Figure 1). Following her second treatment, the patient\u2019s wry sense of humor returned, and she enjoyed spending time with her children and grandchildren. She described the treatments \u201csurreal,\u201d experiencing herself standing outside her body. Following her third treatment, she reported no further depressive symptoms, and requested to stop ketamine due to dissociative symptoms experienced during treatment. Her mood continued to improve over the next several days, with MADRS decreasing to 11. The patient was followed up in the community for over a year with no relapse of catatonic or depressive symptoms and was discharged from community psychiatric services. 3. Discussion The use of ketamine for depression (both unipolar and bipolar) is rapidly expanding. Ketamine is a rapid-acting anesthetic that disrupts association pathways in the brain causing dissociative anesthesia (13). Clinical studies have demonstrated that a single sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine induces rapid and sustained antidepressant actions (14). Studies supporting the safety and efficacy of repeated ketamine dosing are emerging (15). Antagonism of NMDA-type glutamate receptors in the central nervous system may be a possible mechanism for ketamine\u2019s action in catatonia (16). To our knowledge, there are only two other case reports documenting the use of ketamine to treat catatonia (12). The response was rapid and complete; however, the underlying cause of catatonia was unclear. The two cases discussed in this report were both bipolar in nature and it remains unclear how catatonias of alternative underlying pathology would respond. Given that ketamine can induce or exacerbate symptoms of psychosis in healthy and schizophrenic participants (17, 18), these findings do not provide evidence of the efficacy or safety of ketamine in catatonia secondary to other conditions, such as catatonic schizophrenia. Both presentations were complicated by multiple medical co-morbidities. The number of treatments required varied between the patients, however, both showed a significant response within the first few treatments. The treatment was well tolerated by Frontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org fpsyt-14-1138772 April 11, 2023 Time: 6:26 # 4 Sarma et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1138772 the first patient, and the second patient requested to stop treatments due to dissociative side-effects. These cases indicate ketamine is worthy of further investigation as a rapidly acting treatment for catatonia in bipolar depression, especially given the increased risks associated with ECT and limited access in some areas during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Col4a1 mutations are rare, most frequently affect neonates, and occur at a de novo mutation rate between  27% and 40%. Mutations are commonly missense and pleiotropic, presenting with cerebrovascular, renal, oph\u0002thalmological, and muscular abnormalities, collectively known as Gould Syndrome. Cerebral small vessel dis\u0002ease is commonly associated with Gould Syndrome and Col4a1 mutations. Children can present with infantile  hemiplegia/quadriplegia, stroke, epilepsy, motor dysfunction, or white matter changes of the eye. Case Report: A male infant at 38-week, 4-day gestation presented with microcephaly, scattered multifocal hemorrhagic/ ischemic infarcts, ex-vacuo dilatation, polymicrogyria, ventricular septal defect, and narrowed aortic arch, seen  on prenatal ultrasound and confirmed by fetal echocardiogram and fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI). Electroencephalogram showed frequent subclinical seizures that were difficult to control, requiring mul\u0002tiple agents. Ophthalmology evaluation demonstrated small, hypoplastic optic nerves of both eyes, concerning  for septo-optic dysplasia. Postnatal brain MRI confirmed fetal findings. Postnatal genetic testing showed a de  novo heterozygous variant of Col4a1 and 1 nonspecific contiguous region of copy neutral absence of hetero\u0002zygosity on chromosome 11. Conclusions: This neonate was prenatally diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities and postnatally found  to have a de novo heterozygous Col4a1 variant. CNS, cardiac, renal, and hematological findings were likely as\u0002sociated with the Col4a1 mutation and, possibly, a recessive genetic disorder of chromosome 11. Col4a1 mu\u0002tations are rare and have no definitive treatments. Subspecialist follow-up and supportive care are essential  to reduce long-term complications.

Mutations in the Col4a1 gene are inherited  in an autosomal dominant pattern, commonly affecting neo\u0002nates more than children or adults [1]. The de novo rate of  Col4a1 mutations is between 27% and 40% [2,3]. Reported  Col4a1 mutations are commonly missense variants of a glycine  residue in the collagenous Gly-Xaa-Yaa helical domain of the  COL4A1 protein [4,5]. Mutations are pleiotropic and present  with a broad spectrum of abnormalities in the cerebrovascu\u0002lar, renal, ophthalmological, and muscular systems, collective\u0002ly referred to as Gould Syndrome [6]. Phenotypic presentation  associated with Col4a1 mutations and Gould Syndrome is vari\u0002able [3,4]. One study cites tissue-specific mechanistic heteroge\u0002neity as a possible cause of variability, with integrin signaling  affecting ocular and muscular variability more specifically [7]. Diagnoses associated with the Col4a1 mutation most common\u0002ly include hereditary porencephaly or parenchymal hemorrhage  more broadly [3] and genetic cerebral small vessel disease [8],  which affects the small arteries, capillaries, arterioles, and ve\u0002nules of the cerebrovascular system. In children, the Col4a1 mutation is associated with infantile hemiplegia or quadriple\u0002gia, stroke or epilepsy, motor dysfunction, and white matter  changes of the eye on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [9]. Case Report A male infant born at 38 weeks and 4 days gestation present\u0002ed to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with microcephaly, cen\u0002tral nervous system (CNS) anomalies, and a hypoplastic aor\u0002tic arch. The mother was a 24-year-old, gravida 2 para 1, who  received prenatal care. Prenatal ultrasound showed multiple  fetal anomalies, including microcephaly, scattered multifocal  hemorrhagic/ischemic infarcts, ex-vacuo dilatation, polymi\u0002crogyria, moderate ventricular septal defect (VSD), and a nar\u0002rowed aortic arch. The mother subsequently underwent a fe\u0002tal MRI of the brain, which confirmed suspected ultrasound  findings. Fetal echocardiogram showed a dilated right cardi\u0002ac chamber and mild hypoplasia of the left cardiac chambers,  along with a moderate muscular VSD and narrow aortic arch.  She was then seen by the Cardiology, Palliative Medicine, and  Neonatology Departments for prenatal care. The infant was born via cephalic vaginal delivery, with me\u0002conium-stained amniotic fluid. The birth weight was 2.45 kg.  The APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min were 4 and 8, respective\u0002ly. On physical examination, the infant had a dusky appear\u0002ance of the bilateral feet and cool extremities. No other phys\u0002ical abnormalities were seen. The baby was limp at birth with  no spontaneous respiratory effort, required positive pressure  ventilation at birth, and was then transitioned to continuous  positive airway pressure. Postnatal echocardiography showed  a fenestrated atrial septum and moderate mid-muscular VSD,  mild to moderate hypoplastic left ventricle, moderately hypo\u0002plastic left aortic arch, small to moderate patent ductus arte\u0002riosus, and suprasystemic right ventricular systolic pressure.  The infant was started on intravenous (i.v.) prostaglandin E1  owing to suspected coarctation of the aorta. He was then giv\u0002en i.v. epinephrine and dopamine drips because of hypoten\u0002sion. Respiratory support was escalated from nasal continuous  positive airway pressure to noninvasive positive pressure ven\u0002tilation as a result of apnea, presumably secondary to prosta\u0002glandin administration. An echocardiogram obtained after ini\u0002tiation of prostaglandin E demonstrated a widely patent aortic  arch with a VSD. A subsequent echocardiogram showed no ev\u0002idence of coarctation, and prostaglandin E was discontinued. Electroencephalogram showed frequent subclinical seizures.  Seizures were difficult to control, requiring multiple agents, in\u0002cluding i.v. levetiracetam 75 to 150 mg, i.v. lacosamide 6 mg  every 12 h, and i.v. phenobarbital 13 to 50 mg. A subsequent  electroencephalogram after treatment showed no additional  seizures. An ophthalmology evaluation showed small, hypo\u0002plastic optic nerves of both eyes, concerning for septo-optic  dysplasia. The left eye showed a posterior polar cataract with  microspherophakia. Postnatal MRI of the brain (Figures 1, 2)  confirmed findings of multifocal infarcts of unknown etiolo\u0002gy, diffuse mild polymicrogyria, dysgenesis of the corpus cal\u0002losum, optic nerve hypoplasia, a defect within the intraven\u0002tricular septum, and inferior vermian hypoplasia. Genetic analysis with rapid whole exome sequencing and chro\u0002mosomal microarray were obtained owing to concern for pa\u0002rental consanguinity. XomeDxXpress Clinical Exome Sequence  Analysis showed a de novo heterozygous variant at c. 2771  G>A of the Col4a1 gene. Chromosomal microarray analysis re\u0002vealed a normal male sex chromosome with no other clinically  significant abnormalities and a nonspecific contiguous region  of copy neutral absence of heterozygosity on chromosome 11. Postnatal renal ultrasound showed mild calyceal dilatation of  the left kidney. Cytomegalovirus workup was negative. The infant was weaned to room air and continued to improve  on oral feeds. By the time of discharge, the infant was taking  most of the feeds orally. The infant was discharged on room  air and oral hydrochlorothiazide-spironolactone 3 mg, given  the VSD with the pulmonary over-circulation. Oral phenobarbi\u0002tal 20 mg/5 mL, oral levetiracetam 100 mg/mL, and oral lacos\u0002amide 10 mg/mL were continued for seizure management with  the Neurology Department. Patel H. et al: CNS and cardiac abnormalities with a Col4a1 variant \u00a9 Am J Case Rep, 2023; 24: e938651 e938651-2 Indexed in: [PMC] [PubMed] [Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)] [Web of Science by Clarivate] This work is licensed under Creative Common Attribution\u0002NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) Discussion Col4a1 mutations constitute a wide range of phenotypic pre\u0002sentations that are categorized under Gould Syndrome, includ\u0002ing cerebral small vessel disease, which has histopathologic  findings including reduced vessel lumens and wall thickening  that cause reduced perfusion [8]. Common manifestations of  the Col4a1 variants include leukoaraisosis, strokes, and peri\u0002natal intracerebral hemorrhage with consequent porenceph\u0002aly, all of which constitute the \u201cCOL4A1 stroke syndrome\u201d [2].  Cerebral small vessel disease is commonly associated with isch\u0002emic strokes in 20% to 30% of cases [8]. Hereditary angiopa\u0002thy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle vessel involve\u0002ment are associated with asymptomatic cerebral small vessel  disease, large vessel cerebral involvement, and systemic in\u0002volvement (eg, kidney, muscle, and eye) in the setting of Col4a1 mutations [10]. Diagnosis is determined by the various clini\u0002cal findings, along with genetic testing for the Col4a1 variant. No specific treatment is available for the sequelae of Col4a1 ge\u0002netic variants. Stroke risk reduction, especially in the presence  of hypertension, and neuroprotection are important to reduce  the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or other CNS complica\u0002tions [2]. Additional supportive care and follow-up with sub\u0002specialists for systemic involvement are necessary to prevent  progression. Counseling to avoid risk factors such as smok\u0002ing, anticoagulants, and potentials for head trauma should be  provided [11]. Other individualized needs regarding home care  and minimizing emotional, physical, and financial burden on  caregivers are important to consider. Genetic counseling is needed to identify the mechanism of in\u0002heritance and potential downstream effects on family mem\u0002bers and descendants. Prenatal testing is a consideration when  the familial pathogenic variant is known [11]. Lastly, previous cases of Col4a1 variants are consistent with  the neurological presentation in this case, including cerebral  small vessel disease and optic nerve defects, broadly catego\u0002rized under Gould Syndrome. Another study identified a sin\u0002gle nucleotide polymorphism in the Col4a1 gene associated  with arterial stiffness [12]. The cardiac findings in our patient,  namely aortic coarctation and VSD, have not previously been  associated with Gould Syndrome or a Col4a1 variant and po\u0002tentially convey the presence of multiple disorders. One pos\u0002sible causative factor for an additional disorder in this patient  is the nonspecific contiguous region of copy neutral absence  of heterozygosity on chromosome 11. The presence of this re\u0002gion in both parents may be indicative of a recessive disorder  caused by a gene within the absence of heterozygosity region. Conclusions This case presents a neonatal patient who was prenatally di\u0002agnosed with CNS and cardiac abnormalities and postnatally  found to have a de novo heterozygous variant of the Col4a1 gene and a nonspecific contiguous region on chromosome  Figure 1.

Allergic follicular or papillary conjunctivitis is a well-known side effect of brimonidine. Brimonidine is associated  with ocular allergic symptoms such as conjunctival hyperemia, stinging sensation, photophobia and, in severe  cases, corneal erosions. Here, we report a case of atypical conjunctival lesion following long-term administration  of brimonidine.  Case presentation: We report the clinical findings of a 72-year-old female presenting with a salmon patch-like  conjunctival lesion affecting the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva after long-term use of brimonidine. The  finding was suspicious of conjunctival lymphoproliferative disorders. However, upon cessation of brimonidine,  along with the administration of short-course topical steroid, a complete resolution of the lesion was evident.  Biopsy was not performed as the clinical picture improved with conservative management. No recurrence was  observed over 1 year follow up.  Discussion: Atypical conjunctival lesions have been described after long-term use of brimonidine. These lesions  can mimic the appearance of conjunctival tumors, specifically conjunctival lymphoproliferative disorders, for  which multiple investigations are required including invasive conjunctival biopsy.  Conclusion: Careful observation is recommended for patients with a history of long-term use of brimonidine for  the development of atypical conjunctival lesions which may simulate the appearance of conjunctival lympho\u0002proliferative disorders.  1. Introduction  Brimonidine, a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is a widely used  intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering agent for various types of glaucoma  and ocular hypertension. It decreases IOP by reducing the production of  aqueous humor and increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through  the uveoscleral route. Brimonidine is associated with significant ocular  side effects, especially with chronic use. Allergic follicular or papillary  conjunctivitis affecting mainly the inferior bulbar and palpebral con\u0002junctiva is the most common side effect of brimonidine [1]. Brimonidine  is associated with ocular allergic symptoms such as conjunctival hy\u0002peremia, stinging sensation, photophobia and, in severe cases, corneal  erosions [1]. However, these symptoms typically improve, and the  conjunctival follicles vanish after stopping the offending agent.  Atypical conjunctival lesions have been described after long-term use  of brimonidine [2\u20134]. These lesions can mimic the appearance of  conjunctival tumors, specifically conjunctival lymphoproliferative dis\u0002orders, for which multiple investigations are required including invasive  conjunctival biopsy. Here, we report a case of atypical conjunctival  lesion following long-term administration of brimonidine. This case  report has been prepared and written in line with the SCARE criteria [5].  2.

She has been using 0.15 % brimonidine tartrate (Alphagan P; Allergan  Inc., Irvine, Calif) three times daily in the RE for the last two years. The  patient denied systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss and night  sweat. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 in RE  and no light perception LE. Her intraocular pressure (IOP) was 18 mmHg  with central corneal thickness of 535 um in RE. Anterior segment ex\u0002amination of the RE showed hyperemic conjunctiva, diffuse, elevated,  salmon patch-like lesions affecting the bulbar conjunctiva temporal to  the limbus (Fig. 1A) and the palpebral conjunctiva (Fig. 1B), clear  cornea, deep anterior chamber, and posterior subcapsular cataract.  Optic disc examination showed cup-disc ratio of 0.4 with unremarkable  fundus exam in RE. Anterior segment examination of the LE showed  conjunctivalized cornea with dense corneal scarring and severe limbal  stem cell deficiency. The clinical picture of the RE was suspicious for  conjunctival lymphoproliferative disorders and conjunctival biopsy was  considered. Prior to proceeding with biopsy, brimonidine was dis\u0002continued and preservative-free dorzolamide 2 % eye drop twice daily  was commenced. In addition, a short course of fluorometholone acetate  0.1 % eye drops with a tapering dose over one month was also initiated  along with close follow up. After 3 weeks, the bulbar and palpebral  conjunctival lesions resolved entirely resulting in quiet looking con\u0002junctiva (Fig. 2A, B). The IOP was maintained with dorzolamide eye  drops. The ocular symptoms improved significantly and the patient  remained symptom-free throughout. Biopsy was not performed as the  clinical picture improved with conservative management. No recurrence  was observed over 1 year follow up.  3. Discussion  Glaucoma is a chronic disorder that typically requires long-term use  of IOP-lowering agents to prevent the progression of optic nerve dam\u0002age. Brimonidine is a commonly used antiglaucoma drop in clinical  practice. Brimonidine is known to cause significant allergic reactions in  the cornea and conjunctiva after long-term use [6]. Ocular side effects  associated with brimonidine use include conjunctival hyperemia, pru\u0002ritus, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, and stinging sensation [6].  Ocular allergic reaction has been observed in 9.6 % of patients after  long-term use of brimonidine [7].  Conjunctival lymphoproliferative disorders refer to a diverse group  of lesions ranging from reactive lymphoid hyperplasia to malignant  lymphoma [8]. Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia results from chronic in\u0002flammatory response of lymphoid tissues to various antigenic stimuli  and irritations [9]. Hwang et al. identified 19 patients with suspected  conjunctival lymphoproliferative lesions following long-term adminis\u0002tration of 0.15 % brimonidine after a mean duration of 29 months of use  [3]. Among the 19 patients, five patients agreed to undergo conjunctival  biopsy. Histopathological findings of conjunctival lymphoproliferative  disorders were evident in 4 patients. In our case, although the lesion was  suspicious for conjunctival lymphoproliferative disorders, the biopsy  was deferred and a more stepwise management approach was executed.  Atypical conjunctival follicular or papillary reactions after long-term  Fig. 1.

International Journal of Surgery Case Reports 108 (2023) 108421 3 use of brimonidine have been described in a few case reports. Bae et al.  reported 2 cases of atypical conjunctival lesions in patients using bri\u0002monidine; one of which required conjunctival biopsy to rule out  conjunctival lymphoma [4]. Both cases resolved after the discontinua\u0002tion of brimonidine. Gupta and Vernon have described unusual limbal  follicles on the conjunctiva of a patient treated with brimonidine and  dorzolamide which has resolved after stopping the topical medications  [2]. Similarly, the atypical conjunctival lesion in our case resolved after  discontinuing brimonidine along with administering a short course of  topical steroid. Preservative-free topical dorzolamide was started to  reduce surface toxicity along with controlling the IOP.  Brimonidine has been reported to be associated with the develop\u0002ment of anterior granulomatous uveitis [10]. Brimonidine-induced  uveitis typically presents with corneal endothelial keratic precipitates  and anterior chamber cells and flare [11]. Most of the brimonidine\u0002induced uveitis cases were documented in patients above the age of  75 years following long-term application of brimonidine [11]. In most  cases, the uveitis resolved only on cessation of brimonidine with or  without topical steroid administration [12]. In our case, the patient did  not develop any signs of anterior or posterior uveitis.  4. Conclusion  We described a patient with an atypical conjunctival lesion after  long-term administration of brimonidine. The finding was suspicious of  conjunctival lymphoproliferative disorders. However, upon cessation of  brimonidine, along with the administration of short-course topical ste\u0002roid, a complete resolution of the lesion was evident. Careful observa\u0002tion is recommended for patients with a history of long-term use of  brimonidine for the development of atypical conjunctival lesions which  may simulate the appearance of conjunctival lymphoproliferative  disorders.

Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment, but their responses are variable and relapses are  frequent. Thus, many experts have sought to replace corticosteroids with immunosuppressive agents. Patient concerns: A 35-year-old woman experienced a progressive hearing impairment, initially on the left side and later  becoming bilateral. Her response to corticosteroid monotherapy was temporary, and there have been two relapse episodes over  several months. Diagnoses: Autoimmune inner ear disease was considered due to evidence of autoimmunity combined with a clinical course  of bilateral and recurrent sensorineural hearing loss and a partial response to corticosteroid therapy. Interventions: The patient received a 3-day mini-pulse of methylprednisolone at 250mg/d, followed by 12mg/d maintenance,  and concurrently began an azathioprine regimen gradually increasing to 100mg/day as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. Outcomes: Three weeks after immunosuppressive therapy, hearing and pure-tone audiometry improved, and after 7 weeks,  methylprednisolone was tapered to 8mg/d. The dosage was further reduced by adding methotrexate at 7.5mg/week, resulting  in a reduction to 4mg/d as maintenance therapy after 4 weeks. Lessons: For patients who are unresponsive to corticosteroids or experience difficulty tolerating them, a combination therapy  of methotrexate and azathioprine is recommended as a viable alternative as this regimen is well-tolerated and yields positive  outcomes.

Introduction Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) typically presents with  bilateral hearing loss that progresses over weeks or months,  but the mechanisms underlying AIED remain unknown.  Corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone, intratympanic methyl\u0002prednisolone, intratympanic dexamethasone) are considered the  first-line treatment; however, treatment responses are variable.  Besides, many patients experience frequent relapses when using  corticosteroid monotherapy. Due to the above reasons, many  experts tried to use immunosuppressive agents to replace the  use of corticosteroids. This article reports a woman with AIED,  whose response to corticosteroid monotherapy was transient,  accompanied by 2 relapse episodes over months. We prescribed  methotrexate and azathioprine as combination therapy, which  led to a significant improvement in her pure-tone average. We  recorded all pure-tone audiometry (PTA) data to evaluate the  response to treatment. In addition, we reviewed the literature to  assess the effects of current immunosuppressant therapy options  for improving AIED. K-HH and H-CL contributed equally to this work.

Case description A 35-year-old woman experienced progressive left-sided hear\u0002ing impairment, which started in October 2014. At the time of  initial symptom presentation, the patient was pregnant at 16  weeks of gestation and refused to accept medical treatment  after seeking medical attention due to fears that the medication  posed a pregnancy risk. Her left hearing function deteriorated  gradually until she reported profound left-sided hearing loss at  31 weeks of gestation. She delivered a healthy full-term baby  in April 2015. Due to her concern about the potential adverse  effects of drug treatment on breastfeeding infants and her pres\u0002ervation of normal hearing in her right ear at that time, she did  not seek any treatment postpartum until progressive right-side  hearing impairment developed starting in March 2018 (Fig. 1).  A physical examination revealed bilateral intact eardrums, posi\u0002tive Rinne test in both ears and no obvious sound lateralization  in Weber test due to both ear hearing loss. Also, no joint tender\u0002ness, swelling, deformity, or motion limitation was observed. No  erythema, petechiae, blisters, objective pulsatile tinnitus, trau\u0002matic scar, or focal neurologic signs were identified. Magnetic  resonance imaging of the internal auditory canal revealed no  lesions in the paranasal sinuses, mastoids, ventricular system,  or brain parenchyma. She received treatment starting on March  26, 2018, which included an intratympanic dexamethasone  injection at 5mg/mL in her right ear and 3 days of intravenous  hydrocortisone at 300mg/d. Then, the dosage was reduced to  oral prednisolone at 60mg/d. The corticosteroid dosage was  gradually tapered daily and eventually reduced to 20mg/d  of prednisolone (Fig.  2A). However, corticosteroid therapy  only partially improved hearing function (from 65 to 40 dB).  Moreover, her hearing deteriorated again after 16 days (from 40  to 60 dB) (Fig. 1), so she received a second course of treatment  with intratympanic dexamethasone and systemic corticosteroid  therapy starting on April 19, 2018. After this course of treat\u0002ment, her hearing improved again (from 60 to 45 dB) (Fig. 1).  Therefore, she started maintenance treatment with oral prednis\u0002olone at 15mg/d starting on April 26, 2018 (Fig. 2A). Over the  next 4 months, she experienced many side effects of corticoste\u0002roids, including moon face, weight gain, acne, easy bruising, and  intermittent urinary tract infections. However, because her hear\u0002ing did not worsen during this period, she did not actively seek  medical care or continued monitoring after September 8, 2018.  Nevertheless, she reported profound right-sided hearing loss in  late June 2019, and oral prednisolone at 15mg/d was resumed.  When she showed no significant improvement, she was referred  to a rheumatology clinic in August 2019. On August 24, 2019, a PTA test indicated a severe sensori\u0002neural hearing impairment, with a baseline of 71 dB in the right  ear and 120 dB in the left ear (Fig. 1). Serology tests were unre\u0002markable, except for borderline positive lupus anticoagulant and  Figure 1. Pure-tone audiometry for both ears by air conduction at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz.

(D) Treatment initiated on December 19, 2019, consisting of oral corticosteroids (8mg/d methylprednisolone,  tapered to 4mg/d starting January 10, 2020), 100mg/d azathioprine, 400mg/d hydroxychloroquine, and 7.5mg/week methotrexate. (C) Pure-tone audiometry  and (D) pure-tone average of the left ear. Left ear air conduction was poor since her first episode during pregnancy in October 2014. Without timely medical  treatment, her left ear hearing function deteriorated gradually.

Pure-tone average of the right ear. (A) Medical treatment in the ENT (Otolaryngology) Department in April. Treatment began on March 26, 2018, with  an intratympanic injection of dexamethasone at 5mg/mL in the right ear and 3 days of intravenous hydrocortisone 300mg/d, then reduced to 60mg/d of oral  prednisolone. Corticosteroid therapy only partially improved her hearing (from 65 to 40 dB), which declined again after 16 days (from 40 to 60 dB). A second  course of treatment (intratympanic dexamethasone and systemic corticosteroid therapy) began on April 19 and improved her hearing (from 60 to 45 dB).  Maintenance treatment with 15mg/d of oral prednisolone started on April 26, 2018. (B) Medical treatment in the Rheumatology Department (from September  2019 to February 2020). In September 2019, the patient received a 3-day mini-pulse of methylprednisolone at 250mg/d, followed by 12mg/d maintenance, and  concurrently began an azathioprine regimen gradually increasing to 100mg/day as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. Aspirin (100mg/d) and hydroxychloroquine  (400mg/d) were added due to weakly positive lupus anticoagulants in the patient\u2019s blood. Three weeks after immunosuppressive therapy, hearing and PTA  improved, and after 7 weeks, methylprednisolone was tapered to 8mg/d. The dosage was further reduced by adding methotrexate at 7.5mg/week, resulting  in a reduction to 4mg/d as maintenance therapy after 4 weeks. PTA = pure-tone audiometry. 4 Huang et al. \u2022 Medicine (2023) 102:23 Medicine antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody (Table 1). A  diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was excluded  due to the patient\u2019s negative antinuclear antibody test and lack  of clinical manifestations associated with SLE, such as skin rash,  arthritis, cytopenia, nephritis, proteinuria, and other SLE-specific  autoantibodies. A diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis was also  excluded due to the lack of any clinical symptoms or signs of  hyperthyroidism. AIED was considered due to evidence of autoim\u0002munity combined with a clinical course of bilateral and recurrent  sensorineural hearing loss and a partial response to corticosteroid  therapy (Tables 2 and 3). The patient was administered 250mg/d  of mini-pulse methylprednisolone for 3 days in September 2019,  followed by 12mg/d of methylprednisolone. We also administered  azathioprine and gradually increased the dosage to 100mg/d to  serve as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. While the patient had no  history of thrombotic events or pregnancy-related complications,  which do not fulfill the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome,  the presence of weakly positive lupus anticoagulants in their  blood led us to administer 100mg/d of aspirin and 400mg/d of  hydroxychloroquine as adjuvant therapy (Fig. 2B). Three weeks  after the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, the patient\u2019s  hearing function improved significantly (Fig. 1), and a follow-up  PTA also showed improvement. Seven weeks after starting  immunosuppressive therapy, the methylprednisolone dosage was  tapered to 8mg/d (Fig. 2B). Due to the patient\u2019s prior experience  of enduring many side effects of corticosteroids, to reduce the  methylprednisolone dosage even further, we added methotrexate  at 7.5mg/week as a corticosteroid-sparing agent with a full aza\u0002thioprine dose (100mg/d). After 4 weeks of administering meth\u0002otrexate at 7.5mg/week, the patient\u2019s methylprednisolone was  reduced to 4mg/d as maintenance therapy (Fig. 2B). 3. Discussion AIED is an uncommon disease that typically presents with bilat\u0002eral hearing loss but is sometimes asymmetrical.[1] The disease  course progresses over weeks or months rather than days or  years, unlike other hearing loss diseases, such as sudden deaf\u0002ness (occurs in minutes or hours), cochlear Meniere disease  (sudden hearing loss with fluctuation), or cochlear (otosclerotic)  deafness (progresses in years).[2] Corticosteroids are the first\u0002line treatment for AIE.[2,3] Although about 70% of patients may  initially respond to corticosteroid therapy, the treatment effect  often decreases over time. Finally, only 14% of patients had real  therapeutic responses to corticosteroids.[4\u20138] McCabe first described the term AIED in 1979.[2] The clin\u0002ical features of AIED are variable and can include fluctuating  or progressive hearing loss (over a period of weeks or months),  sometimes accompanied by functional vestibular impairment.[1] AIED can present as an isolated inner ear disease or as second\u0002ary to systemic autoimmune disorders.[6,9,10] An AIED diagnosis  depends on the clinical presentation and responsiveness to cor\u0002ticosteroid treatment,[11] with no currently available serologic  marker (Tables  2 and 3).[12] Although many biomarkers have  been reported to detect AIED, including myelin P0 protein,[13] the 58-kDa protein,[14] and the 68-kDa protein,[15] they are all  in the inner ear and limited to use as research tools due to low  sensitivity.[16] In this case, these biomarkers were not utilized to  diagnose the patient. The precise mechanisms underlying AIED have not yet been  established in humans due to the lack of available histological tis\u0002sue specimens. Most studies use an animal model to test hypoth\u0002eses related to AIED.[17,18] Recent studies have reported that  immune-competent cells and macrophages found in the endolym\u0002phatic sac of the inner ear may represent the primary site of the  immune response.[1,18\u201322] Many clinical cases have demonstrated  a relationship between progressive hearing loss and autoimmune  diseases, suggesting that immunocomplexes may damage the  inner ear tissue.[20] Lymphocyte and immunoglobulins have also  been shown to enter the ear and cause immune reactions in some  animal studies, suggesting that both cell- and antibody-mediated  immunity are involved in AIED pathogenesis.[17,18,23] Table 1 Laboratory data in August 2019.

Table 2 Common differential diagnosis and clinical presentations of sensorineural hearing loss. Laterality Clinical manifestations  Autoimmune  disease Usually bilateral  and asymmetric This condition may have a fluctuating or progressive clinical course, and its symptoms may be  localized to the ear or indicative of systemic autoimmune disease. Vascular  disease Unilateral This condition typically presents with sudden onset and may be accompanied by other neurological  signs or symptoms such as diplopia, nystagmus, facial asymmetry, limb clumsiness, or ataxia. Infections Unilateral or  bilateral This condition typically presents with sudden onset and may be accompanied by symptoms such  as vertigo, facial pain, or paralysis. Neoplasms Unilateral or asym\u0002metric In addition to its primary symptoms, this condition may also be accompanied by other manifesta\u0002tions such as unilateral tinnitus, disequilibrium, dizziness, or headaches. 5 Huang et al. \u2022 Medicine (2023) 102:23 www.md-journal.com Corticosteroids remain the mainstay treatment for AIED.[24] Intratympanic steroid injections have emerged as a viable  alternative treatment with greater long-term tolerability.[24\u201328] However, nonsteroidal immunosuppressants (cyclophospha\u0002mide, methotrexate, and azathioprine) and biological agents  (TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors, antiCD20 antibody, and IL-1 receptor antag\u0002onists) are potential options for refractory AIED. Cyclophosphamide is no longer frequently used to treat  AIED due to its side effect profile and poor results in hearing  improvement.[24,29\u201332] Methotrexate has been used as an alternative treatment for  refractory AIED due to better long-term tolerability than cyclo\u0002phosphamide and fewer side effects than corticosteroids.[32,33] While methotrexate appears effective for treating vestibular  symptoms, the hearing response to methotrexate can vary, with  0 to 70% of cases experiencing hearing improvements.[3\u201337] Azathioprine was found to result in significant hearing  improvements in most patients when administered with  concomitant prednisone therapy.[37] Noguchi et al suggested  that azathioprine combined with oral corticosteroids could  be used for hearing losses that preferentially compromise  low frequencies and gradual deterioration, such as in patients  with hearing loss and Bechet disease.[38] A longitudinal and  observational descriptive study showed that the relapse rate  of patients treated with azathioprine was 0.52 relapses/year,  with 50% relapsing by 9.70 months. In contrast, the relapse  rate of patients treated with corticosteroid therapy was 2.01  relapses/year, with patients relapsing at 5.25 months on aver\u0002age (Table 4).[39] Regarding biological agents, some treatment studies of  anakinra and infliximab show higher percentages of hearing  improvement.[40] Systemic injection of etanercept exerted its  effects through decreasing cochlear inflammation and fibrosis  with reduced cochlear infiltrating cell numbers in animal stud\u0002ies,[41\u201343] and showed its equivalence to corticosteroids in treat\u0002ing induced labyrinthitis.[44] Table 3 Diagnosis approach and treatment.

In addition, improvement in vestibular symptoms is more signif\u0002icant than hearing symptoms. The patient in our case report showed only transient responses  to oral corticosteroids and intratympanic corticosteroid injec\u0002tions, experiencing 2 relapses at 3 and 14 months. Due to the  refractory nature of this disease, immunosuppressant combina\u0002tion therapy was administered, consisting of methotrexate and  azathioprine, which resulted in a significant response, leading  to the stable return of the ability to detect low- and middle-fre\u0002quency pure tones (500 and 1000 Hz). The response was defined  in line with the recent consensus on hearing improvement as a  threshold shift of \u226515 dB at 1 frequency, \u226510 dB at 2 or more  consecutive frequencies, or a 12% change in discrimination score  within 3 months of commencing the therapy.[3] No side effects  were noted in response to methotrexate and azathioprine com\u0002bination therapy, and the corticosteroid dose was successfully  tapered to a maintenance dose of 4mg/d methylprednisolone. There are some limitations in this case. First, the diagnosis of  AIED is very challenging due to the lack of clear serological tests  and biomarkers. We diagnosed AIED based on its typical clinical  presentation, disease course, and the exclusion of other possi\u0002ble diseases. Second, although the patient had a good response  under methotrexate and azathioprine combination therapy, we  can\u2019t well illustrate the special prognostic factors in this patient.  Third, we didn\u2019t try other immunosuppressive agents as ste\u0002roid-sparing agents due to the awareness of possible side effects. AIED is an uncommon disease. Although corticosteroids are  often prescribed as the first-line treatment, treatment responses  are variable, and many patients experience a relapse when using  corticosteroid monotherapy. We recommend using combination  therapy with methotrexate and azathioprine as steroid-sparing  agents for patients who are refractory to corticosteroids alone  in treatment or have poor tolerability of corticosteroids, as this  regimen is well-tolerated with good treatment response.

This case describes a pediatric female who was diagnosed with early-onset  schizophrenia and catatonia in her early adolescence, and was later found to have DLG4-related synaptopathy, also  known as SHINE syndrome. SHINE syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dysfunction of the  postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded by the DLG4 gene. After failing three antipsychotic drug treat\u0002ments, the patient was started on clozapine, which resulted in signifcant improvements in positive and negative  symptoms. This case illustrates the impact of clozapine in treatment-resistant early-onset psychosis and exemplifes  practical implications for genetic testing in early-onset schizophrenia. Keywords Synaptopathy, Clozapine, Early-onset, Treatment-resistant, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Genetic testing,  Pediatric Background Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), schizophrenia with  onset before 18 years old, Very Early Onset Schizophre\u0002nia (VEOS), schizophrenia with onset before 13  years  old, and psychotic symptoms in pediatric patients are  rare and require further workup to exclude primary psy\u0002chiatric and neurologic conditions, infectious processes,  and toxic or metabolic causes. While adult-onset schiz\u0002ophrenia has been studied in detail, research on EOS  is limited, partly due to its low prevalence and because  EOS was not recognized in the diagnostic systems before  the introduction of DSM-III in 1980. Te prevalence of  schizophrenia in children and adolescents is low, about  1.4 in 10,000 before the age of 15 [1, 2]. Te etiology of  EOS is not well understood because of the scant data on  this condition, and even less is known about the role of  genetic variations in EOS, which leads to the low inci\u0002dence of genetic testing in patient workup unless the  patient\u2019s family history includes schizophrenia [3]. One  rare genetic cause of EOS is SHINE syndrome. SHINE syndrome, also known as DLG4-related syn\u0002aptopathy, is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to dys\u0002function of the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95),  encoded by  DLG4. Te prevalence of this disorder is  unknown, with 53 patients confrmed in global literature  reviews [4]. PSD-95 regulates excitatory synaptic func\u0002tion, strength, and plasticity in the brain. It plays a key  role in brain development and function with major mod\u0002ulatory efects on glutamatergic synapses.

Developmental regression is also a common symptom  amongst SHINE patients. In addition, several behavioral  issues including self-aggression, behavioral outbursts,  bipolar disorder, catatonia, and obsessive\u2013compulsive  disorder (OCD), have been described in conditions that  afect glutamatergic neuron activity [5, 6]. SHINE syndrome is an acronym for a common set  of symptoms seen in afected patients, including Sleep  disturbances, Hypotonia, Intellectual disability, Neu\u0002rological disorders, and Epilepsy [7]. Autistic features,  regression in motor and language skills, and psychosis  have been reported in less than half of cases. Psychosis  is not considered a cardinal feature of the condition. Our  understanding of the relationship between SHINE syn\u0002drome and early onset psychosis is limited, with fewer  than 10 documented cases in the literature. Case presentation An early-adolescent female with a past medical history  of learning disability diagnosed in 1st grade, presented to  the psychiatry clinic with a 7-month history of selective  mutism and depressed mood. She had an unremarkable birth history and had met  her motor milestones. She did not start speaking until  23 months, when she reportedly started speaking in age\u0002appropriate full sentences. In addition, she was reported  not to smile or interact as much as other children but  was still \u201ca happy and social child and made friends\u201d. Her  mother reported that she was diagnosed with a learning  disability in 1st grade and placed on an Individualized  Education Plan (IEP) for math and reading, but excelled  in those classes with A\u2019s and B\u2019s. At the time of the ini\u0002tial visit, she had recently started 8th grade. She enjoyed  gymnastics, tumbling, and cheerleading until October  of 2019. Menarche occurred at 13 years old, and menses  were irregular, with only 8 periods from 2019\u20132021. She  has a family history of bipolar I with psychotic features in  her paternal grandmother that responded well to quetia\u0002pine. Otherwise, family psychiatric history was negative.  She lives with her parents and 18-year-old brother and  has no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. At the initial visit, the patient softly told her parents  that \u201cTe Voice\u201d told her not to talk. She was diagnosed  with selective mutism and adjustment disorder at pres\u0002entation, started on sertraline and Cognitive Behavioral  Terapy (CBT). She continued to withdraw with ongoing  refusal to speak to family and peers. She began whisper\u0002ing to internal stimuli and displayed physical aggression  to her parents. Within a few months, she stopped par\u0002ticipating in self-care/hygiene and developed mixed cat\u0002atonia, with mutism, posturing, and agitation. She was  hospitalized and worked up for new-onset psychosis with  EEG, MRI, CT Abdomen, CT Chest, CT Pelvis, and CSF  studies with encephalitis panel, lysosomal enzyme panel,  CRP, ESR, and TPO antibody tests. All results were nor\u0002mal, and she was started on clonazepam and risperidone.  Risperidone 1  mg worsened her mutism, stereotypical  movements, and odd behaviors, and she stopped eat\u0002ing and drinking. Te risperidone was stopped while the  clonazepam continued. During this time, she minimally  interacted with others, and still responded to internal  stimuli. Tere was minimal improvement in her symp\u0002toms with clonazepam, but she was unable to tolerate  increased doses as it made her louder and more dif\u0002cult to manage. Decreasing clonazepam made her less  verbal, more withdrawn, and agitated. Oanzapine 5  mg  was added  with improvements in aggression and was  discharged with residual catatonia. However, at home  she would pace the house for hours, and frequently  tried to elope. She had a good appetite but was still fre\u0002quently responding to internal stimuli. Her catatonia  improved, and clonazepam was tapered of. Olanzapine  was increased with mild improvements in speech pro\u0002duction, and she was able to answer questions with one  to two-word responses. However, she was reported to  start throwing objects and screaming daily, particularly  at night, which interfered with her sleep. Her appetite  increased and her weight subsequently increased. She  was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia in March  2021. In June 2021, due to olanzapine\u2019s metabolic side  efects, she began metformin treatment to help with  weight gain, hyperlipidemia and elevated HgA1c. In November 2021, she started on a cross-titration  from olanzapine 7.5 mg daily to aripiprazole 20 mg daily  due to ongoing internal preoccupation and psychotic  symptoms. She also presented with signifcant side  efects of Parkinsonism and had a 30  lb weight gain on  olanzapine, limiting further titration. Although cross\u0002titration to aripiprazole helped her lose 5 lbs and normal\u0002ized her appetite, she began to have insomnia, regression  of speech, and worsening episodes of physical aggression.  In March 2022, she was restarted on olanzapine, which  stabilized her aggression but resulted in another 10  lb  weight gain. She was still responding to internal stimuli  and displayed prominent negative symptoms. She was evaluated in genetics clinic where she was  noted to be normally grown and minimally dysmor\u0002phic, with hypertelorism and a prominent nose. Her  early development history suggested that an underlying  genetic neurodevelopmental syndrome was responsible  for her psychosis. Te diferential diagnosis included  many chromosome disorders, most prominently  22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Neurometabolic disor\u0002ders other than Wilson disease, were also of concern as  Yang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 3 of 5 many are treatable. Genetic testing was ordered, includ\u0002ing a chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and  whole exome sequencing. Te CMA was normal but  the whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo muta\u0002tion in the gene DLG4, consistent with DLG4-related  synaptopathy also known as SHINE syndrome. Spe\u0002cifcally, she carries thep. (Arg660Ter) (CGA >TGA):  c. 1978 C>T in exon 19 of the DLG4 gene which is a  nonsense variant that is predicted to result in protein  truncation or decay. Tis variant has been observed de  novo without confrmed parentage in multiple unre\u0002lated patients with DLG4-related neurodevelopmental  disorder in the published literature [4]. Te patient also  carries a likely pathogenic variant in the MT-TA gene at  a 2% heteroplasmy level. Due to the low level of hetero\u0002plasmy, it is unknown whether she will exhibit symp\u0002toms of a mitochondrial disorder, although the typical  lower threshold for the presence of any mitochondrial  disease symptoms is 5% heteroplasmy. In May 2022, her parents consented to clozapine treat\u0002ment due to her treatment-refractory schizophrenia,  having trialed risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine.  Metformin was increased to 2000  mg daily, and poly\u0002ethylene glycol was started. Baseline studies for clozap\u0002ine safety monitoring were obtained. Troponin, ANC,  and CRP were within normal limits. EKG showed con\u0002cern for Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, and  after subsequent Holter monitoring for 30 days, she was  cleared by cardiology in July 2022 to begin clozapine  therapy. Because of the prevalence of autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) in SHINE syndrome, she was referred  for a formal autism evaluation and psychological test\u0002ing. Her mother had suspected she had high-functioning  ASD since she was 3 years old as she struggled to relate  socially to children of the same age. At the time of test\u0002ing, she demonstrated moderate to severe intellectual  disability and was diagnosed with co-morbid ASD. To objectively measure the patient\u2019s improvement while  on clozapine, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales  (VABS) (Vineland-3) Comprehensive Interview Form  was used as a reference to assess parent-reported changes  in adaptive functioning. Te VABS is a measure of adapt\u0002able behavior used to assess individuals with intellectual  and developmental disabilities by scoring the patient\u2019s  adaptive behavior abilities in the domains of communi\u0002cation, daily living, and socialization. A baseline assess\u0002ment was obtained prior to clozapine initiation, and she  was scored again 8 months into the clozapine treatment,  to track her improvements. Her VABS Composite score  ranked below the frst percentile throughout treatment,  however, she showed improvements in raw scores across  multiple subdomains, consistent with newly acquired  skills while on clozapine. Improvements in the daily living skills subdomain  included acquiring self-sufciency in areas of feeding,  dressing and hygiene, with the personal daily living  skills raw score improving from 81 to 87. Her interper\u0002sonal relationships, part of subdomain socialization,  demonstrated improvements in social appropriateness,  behavioral and emotional control, with a raw score  increase from 18 to 22. Receptive language raw score  improved from 43 to 51, and included improved ability  to follow instructions and improved attention. Written  skills raw score improved from 29 to 34, with greater  written vocabulary and word recall from memory. Her  expressive language skills remained unchanged, with  pre- and post-clozapine treatment scores at 23. Her  domestic skills raw score improved from 14 to 20, with  the patient now able to make her bed daily and prepare  simple meals for herself. Her mother reports that the patient seems to expe\u0002rience decreased frequency, intensity, and duration  of hallucinations. She is less internally distracted and  more engaged socially, wanting to participate in family  activities and able to participate in testing to return to  in-person school. She has been experiencing a broader  range of afect since the clozapine treatment, with more  frequent smiling. Her sleep and appetite have also  normalized. Te patient was monitored for clozapine side efects  and toxicity weekly for the frst 6  months and biweekly  thereafter. While on clozapine, the patient experienced  increased abdominal girth, which is a well-documented  side efect of clozapine [8]. She did not experience other  metabolic side efects. She did experience sedation dur\u0002ing initial titration, which resolved. During the initial  months of treatment, the patient exhibited tachycardia  of approximately 115 beats per minute. As the clozapine  dose was increased above 200 mg, the patient\u2019s heart rate  rose to 130 beats per minute, with associated symptom  of fatigue. Following extensive evaluation that included  EKG, echocardiogram, serum troponin and CRP moni\u0002toring, and cardiology consult, the tachycardia was attrib\u0002uted to the use of clozapine, which is a known side efect  of the atypical antipsychotic [8]. Te patient was started  on atenolol 12.5  mg daily, which resolved the tachycar\u0002dia and alleviated the associated fatigue. Te patient was  prophylactically prescribed polyethylene glycol as a stool  softener prior to the onset of clozapine titration, and had  no reported constipation during treatment. Te patient  did not experience orthostatic hypotension, myocarditis,  alterations in absolute neutrophil count or other blood  cell counts, extrapyramidal symptoms, sialorrhea, or  other side efects. Overall, the patient\u2019s side efect profle  on clozapine appears similar to those of patients without  SHINE syndrome. Yang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 4 of 5 Discussion Tis report alerts health professionals to the existence of  SHINE syndrome and the need to include it in the dif\u0002ferential diagnosis for acute psychotic symptoms in chil\u0002dren. We also call for more research on synaptopathies  to better understand and treat this disease. SHINE syn\u0002drome, also known as DLG4-related synaptopathy, is  a neurodevelopmental disorder due to dysfunction of  the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded  by  DLG4. Te prevalence of this disorder is unknown,  with only 53 patient cases in global literature reviews [4].  PSD-95 regulates excitatory synaptic function, strength,  and plasticity in the brain. It plays a key role in brain  development and function with major modulatory efects  on glutamatergic synapses. Dysfunction in these recep\u0002tors leads to altered excitatory synaptic transmission.  PSD-95 has a unique role in uncoupling dopamine-glu\u0002tamate and dampening the interaction between them.  Malfunction of this receptor may result in concomitant  overactivation of both D1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA) receptors, jeopardizing neuronal integrity and  triggering neurotoxicity. An important consequence of  the failure of this feedback loop is increased dopamine  levels in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine  pathways, leading to positive, negative and cognitive  symptoms, respectively [5, 8]. Our case study shows that SHINE syndrome may pre\u0002sent with treatment-resistant psychosis in youth. Our  patient\u2019s treatment-resistant schizophrenia second\u0002ary to SHINE syndrome is a rare presentation and is  also uniquely responsive to clozapine therapy. It should  be noted that the patient does have a family history of a  paternal grandmother with adult-onset bipolar disor\u0002der with psychotic features. However, both her parents,  including her father, as well as extended family members,  are free from psychosis and other psychiatric symptoms.  Tis suggests overall low genetic loading for typical psy\u0002chotic illness. Moreover, unlike her grandparent\u2019s illness,  the patient\u2019s psychosis was early-onset, associated with  profound regression and was initially treatment resistant.  Additionally, while psychosis is not considered a cardinal  feature of SHINE syndrome, 10% of the 53 documented  cases had reported psychosis [4]. Terefore, although an  interaction between genetic factors cannot be excluded, it  is highly likely that this child\u2019s mutation related to SHINE  syndrome is the most signifcant contributing cause of her  psychosis. We hypothesize that our patient\u2019s treatment-resistant  psychosis was related to the NMDA dysfunction second\u0002ary to SHINE syndrome, and therefore responsive to glu\u0002tamatergic modulation using clozapine. Clozapine is the  gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Prior  studies have found neurons from clozapine-responsive  patients that exhibited a reciprocal dysregulation of gene  expression, particularly related to glutamatergic and  downstream signaling, which was possibly reversed by  clozapine treatment. Clozapine treatment decreased the  intensity and distress of internal stimuli, afective lability,  aggression, social withdrawal, isolation, thought blocking,  world salad, and afect blunting in our patient. In addition,  the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale showed notable  improvements in executive function, receptive language,  daily living skills, and socialization. Understanding the  unique pathophysiological mechanisms of psychosis in  SHINE syndrome is necessary to better predict who is at  risk for treatment-resistant psychosis and when to con\u0002sider clozapine. Tis case also highlights the importance  of interdisciplinary care in pediatric patients with psy\u0002chosis by illustrating the critical role of genetic specialists  in providing specifc diagnoses which thereby facilitate  appropriate medical treatment. Currently, treatment strategies due to genetic vari\u0002ants for psychosis remain limited. Our decision to use  clozapine as a treatment for resistant schizophrenia was  aided by the knowledge of the patient\u2019s SHINE syndrome  diagnosis, due to a mutation in synapse proteins related  to glutamate. Te ability of clozapine to modulate glu\u0002tamatergic activity made it particularly suitable for this  case. Identifcation of the glutamate protein mutation  helped build our understanding of other mechanisms,  and ultimately enabled us to arrive at the treatment deci\u0002sion for clozapine for this patient. Tese results can pro\u0002vide information regarding how genetic changes afect  neural pathways and proteins, consequently furthering  research capabilities in creating unique interventions  and personalized care. Tis can help to bridge the knowl\u0002edge gap present today, leading to more tailored health  care solutions for those living with SHINE syndrome and  other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion Tis study illustrates the role of SHINE syndrome in the  diferential diagnosis for acute psychotic symptoms in  pediatric patients, and how clozapine can be used as a  treatment, especially for the positive and negative cogni\u0002tive symptoms domains of psychosis secondary to SHINE  syndrome. By describing this unique presentation of  SHINE syndrome, we hope to contribute towards appro\u0002priate clinical suspicion, to disseminate knowledge of the  existence of this condition, and to call for studies on the  possible endocrinologic efects on this disease process.  Tis report also highlights the importance of genetic  screening within the diagnosis of Early Onset Schizo\u0002phrenia. Lastly, the inclusion of genetic testing within  the work up of EOS could provide researchers with new  Yang et al.

Metformin-induced lactic acidosis, management with different renal replacement strategies. Med Int M\u00e9x 2022; 38 (2): 457-466. [bilingual text]                 PAST HISTORY Most severe cases of metabolic acidosis are caused by lactic acid or ketones (diabetic ketoacidosis) and to a lesser extent by methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates, and drugs such as metformin.1 The standard definition of lactic acidosis is a pH <7.35 with lactate concentrations ]exceeding 4 mmol/L on an arterial or venous blood gas test.2,3,4 However, under conditions in which tissue perfusion is impaired, such as in hypovolemic shock, measurement of acid-base status from central venous blood may be more effective.1 An increase in the anion gap, particularly one higher than 30, may be suggestive of lactic acidosis, as well as an increase in the delta AG, although it is not specific.2 High lactate concentrations result from the accumulation of this substrate in bodily fluids and are associated with a poor clinical prognosis. This occurs when lactate production exceeds its consumption or there is a decrease in its excretion.2 Under conditions of tissue hypoxia, whether generalized or localized, lactate increases and accumulates as a result of the inability of the mitochondria to metabolize this substrate. . In addition, the simultaneous presence of acidosis makes it difficult for the liver to eliminate lactate.2 Hyperlactatemia has typically been divided into two [types]: type A, associated with hypoxia, and type B, which may be related to the toxic effects of drugs such as metformin.2,5 Table 1 CASE REPORTS Case one A 70-year-old female patient, who had type 2 diabetes with 20 years of evolution as relevant history, treated with metformin 850 mg every 8 hours and linagliptin 5 mg every 24 hours. She was admitted to the emergency room of our hospital due to sudden neurological deterioration characterized by drowsiness and disorientation, on physical examination she presented with a Glasgow score of 12, hemodynamically unstable, hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure of 50.6 mmHg, which improved after the administration of amines. vasoactive, bradycardic in sinus rhythm according to an electrocardiogram with data compatible with hyperkalemia due to serum potassium of 8.32 mEq/L, initially treated with anti-hyperkalemia measures without dialysis. On the arterial blood gas test the patient was found to have a mixed acid-base disorder characterized by hyperlactatemic pure metabolic acidosis with an albumin-corrected high anion gap of 41.12, compensated by a respiratory alkalosis with expected CO2 calculated with Winter\u2019s formula of 11.3 \u00b1 2; lactate of 17 mmol/L and delta gap of 4.86 (calculated with an ideal AG of 12, an ideal HCO3- of 24 mmol/L and multiplying the final result by 0.6,6 compatible with a pure metabolic disorder). With the central laboratory studies on admission, it was determined that the patient had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 8 mL/min/1.73 m2 (BUN 67.4 mg/dL, urea 144.2 mg/dL, creatinine 5.04 mg/ dL, uric acid 8.5 mg/dL, albumin 2.4 g/dL, calcium 9.9 mEq/L, phosphorus 9.44 mEq/L, sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 8.32 mEq/L, and chloride 105 mEq/L). The patient was admitted to intensive care to start renal replacement therapy with intermittent dialysis modality due to the severity of the metabolic acidosis for three hours with poor tolerance due to hemodynamic instability and increased amine requirement. The decision was made to test metformin concentrations due to suspicion of hyperlactatemic metabolic acidosis secondary to the administration of biguanides due to the poor response to treatment with intermittent renal replacement therapy, obtaining concentrations of 41 \u00b5g/mL (therapeutic range: 1-2 \u00b5g/mL). Table 2 shows the monitoring of arterial blood gas tests that include lactate concentrations, since the patient's admission, during intermittent hemodialysis therapy and during therapy with CRRT (Prismaflex\u00ae). Figures 1 and 2 Case 2 A 63-year-old male patient with a significant history of systemic arterial hypertension with 20 years of evolution, ischemic heart disease treated with percutaneous coronary angioplasty with 20 years of evolution, and type 2 diabetes with 20 years of evolution, treated with an unspecified dose of metformin. He was admitted to the emergency room suffering from severe abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. On physical examination he was found to be hemodynamically unstable, hypotensive, and bradycardic. Subsequently, the patient required advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers, orotracheal intubation and vasoactive amine support, obtaining sinus rhythm, after two cycles, according to an electrocardiogram where data suggestive of an extensive subendocardial lesion on the anterior face was observed. On an arterial blood gas test, the patient was found to have a mixed acid-base disorder characterized by hyperlactatemic pure metabolic acidosis with a non-albumin-corrected high anion gap of 45.43, not compensated by respiratory acidosis with an expected CO2 calculated using Winter\u2019s formula of 14.15 \u00b1 2. Lactate of 15 mmol/L and delta gap of 4.8 (calculated with an ideal AG of 12, ideal HCO3 of 24 mmol/L and multiplying the final result by 0.6),6 compatible with a pure metabolic disorder.  Table 2.

The decision was made to start renal replacement therapy with intermittent hemodialysis due to the severity of the acidosis resistant to the initial treatment for approximately 5.5 hours, with good tolerance and partial relief of the acidosis, which is why the decision was made to monitor the patient hourly with venous blood gas tests every hour, observing rebound and increased metabolic acidosis one hour after finishing the first hemodialysis session. The decision was made to restart renal replacement therapy (IHD) for approximately eight hours, again obtaining relief from the metabolic acidosis. Table 3 shows the monitoring of arterial blood gas tests that include lactate concentrations, since the patient's admission and during intermittent hemodialysis therapy. Figures 3 and 4 LACTIC ACIDOSIS Metformin-induced lactic acidosis Metformin is the first-line oral medication for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [sic: Endocrinology], the American College of Endocrinology, and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. for its acronym in English: ADA, AACE, ACE and EFSD [sic: EASD], respectively.7,8 The prevalence of metformin-induced lactic acidosis varies according to the reviewed literature and can be as low as 0.09 cases per 1,000,000 patient-years and as high as 4.3 cases per 100,000 patient-years, according to a Cochrane study.4,9 The main mechanism of action of metformin is to reduce glucose production at the hepatic and intestinal level, increase its peripheral sensitivity, in addition to decreasing lipolysis and somewhat modulate the incretin axis.3,10 In addition, metformin also has a pleiotropic vasoprotective effect, including improving endothelial function, decreasing oxidative stress, and stimulating fibrinolysis.11 Elimination of the drug is predominantly renal, it has a short half-life of between two and six hours in patients with normal renal function.4,10,11,12 Metformin increases the rate of anaerobic metabolism of glucose, since it decreases the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase even in the presence of oxygen, therefore, it increases the net production of lactic acid (Figure 5).3,5,12 The excess lactate produced by the metabolism of glucose in the presence of metformin passes from the splanchnic bed directly to the liver, where it is metabolized, decreasing the rate of gluconeogenesis.3 The risk of developing type B (non-hypoxic) lactic acidosis during metformin therapy has been the subject of much debate.

Pyruvate pathways.3,5,12 lactic acidosis in patients treated with metformin varies according to several comparative studies, obtaining a risk similar to that observed in patients who do not take this drug.10,12 Therefore, taking into account the availability of the drug worldwide, lactic acidosis produced by metformin is a very rare adverse event.3 During the approach for suspected lactic acidosis, causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis should be ruled out, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, ingestion of toxic substances or shock secondary to sepsis, among others.12 The relationship between metformin and lactic acidosis is complex, since metformin administration can be a cause or a coincidence.3 The prognosis of patients does not seem to be related to the plasma concentrations of metformin or lactate, although, according to a systematic review, mortality in patients with metformin overdose and serum concentrations greater than 50 mg/L is close to 40%.11,12 Decreased kidney function is the most important risk factor of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, followed by liver failure. Traditionally, metformin has been contraindicated based on serum creatinine concentrations, being higher than 1.4 mg/dL (MDRD <38 mL/min) and 1.5 mg/dL (MDRD <47 mL/min) in women and men, respectively (Table 4).3,7,10 Other risk factors that may contraindicate the administration of metformin include: decompensated heart failure, tissue hypoxia, respiratory failure, alcoholism, exposure to contrast media, shock, severe infections, dehydration, administration of NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors or diseases that decrease lactate clearance, such as cirrhosis of the liver.3,10,13 Recommendations from the FDA, the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), the Kidney Diseases Initiative and Global Outcomes [sic: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes] (KDIGO), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NIHCE) allow treatment with metformin in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of up to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, all these guidelines also recommend evaluating the dose of the drug in patients with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.11 Table 4. Contraindications and guidelines for metformin withdrawal10,12 Review metformin dose \u2022 Glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Discontinue \u2022 Serum creatinine >1.4 mg in women \u2022 Serum creatinine >1.5 mg in men Glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 Temporary withdrawal \u2022 Suspected temporary hypoxia (acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, respiratory failure, etc.) \u2022 For three days after the use of iodinated contrast media \u2022 Two days before general anesthesia Lactic acidosis produced by metformin results from the combination of anaerobic stimulation derived from the production of lactate by the intestine, which is poorly metabolized and accumulates due to renal failure.3 The most common symptoms related to metformin poisoning are gastrointestinal, although they are not specific.11 Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin is clinically characterized by abdominal pain, drowsiness, and hyperventilation, secondary to metabolic acidosis.5 The fact that no cases of metformin-related lactic acidosis have been reported does not rule out the possibility of drug accumulation in the general population, in whom the contraindications or care for the administration of this drug are not respected.3 It is estimated that around 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes who are hospitalized are treated with metformin despite having contraindications for it.10 Measurement of metformin plasma concentrations is important to confirm suspicion of lactic acidosis in patients taking metformin. Mean plasma concentrations in patients without comorbidities range between 0.5 and 1 mg/L when fasting and between 1 and 2 mg/dL after food.10 Treatment In addition to supportive treatment, such as maintaining adequate renal perfusion and ventilation, the first step in treatment is aimed at finding the precipitating cause of decreased lactate production.5 Specific treatment of metformin-induced lactic acidosis involves stimulating urination or using renal replacement therapies, such as hemodialysis, both with the purpose of eliminating the drug, since there is no specific antidote for the administration of this biguanide.3,4,10,14 The administration of crystalloid solutions or balanced solutions, as well as vasoactive amines, is also part of the treatment, taking care not to overstimulate \u03b22 receptors because they are related to increased lactate concentrations.14 In addition to basic supportive therapies, the treatment of acidosis has included the administration of bases, mainly sodium bicarbonate. However, this measure has not been shown to reduce mortality, even when the pH is corrected.1,14 One of the explanations for this failure is the exacerbation of intracellular acidosis (paradoxical acidosis), decrease in Ca2+ ionized calcium, leftward shift of hemoglobin, hypernatremia, and increased serum osmolarity.1,4 Some of the indications for starting renal replacement therapy in patients with acute kidney injury include: treatment-resistant severe metabolic acidosis (pH <7.2); treatment-resistant severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L); treatment-resistant fluid overload, uremia (BUN >110 mg/dL), and alcohol, drug, or medication poisoning, such as with metformin.15 Although there are no randomized clinical trials establishing the best replacement therapy for patients with metformin-induced lactic acidosis, there are recommendations for starting it, such as lactate >20 mmol/L and pH \u22647.0.4 In the case of metformin-induced lactic acidosis, renal replacement therapy allows for simultaneous elimination of the drug and correction of the acid-base state. However, the modality of dialysis in this disease has not been established.11 On the one hand, conventional intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) should be chosen in hemodynamically stable patients. On the other hand, continuous renal replacement therapy is preferred in hemodynamically unstable patients, despite the decreased rate of drug elimination.11,15 The recommendation by EXTRIP (Extracorporeal Treatments In Poisoning Workgroup) is to start the intermittent modality early, because it is superior to other therapies for acidosis correction and drug elimination, as well as being more available, cheaper and is associated with fewer complications.4 Due to the accumulation of metformin in peripheral tissues, there is a rebound in drug concentrations after a standard four-hour session of intermittent hemodialysis. Sustained low-efficiency therapy [sic: dialysis] (SLED) may be considered the best therapy, because it allows for better hemodynamic stability compared to continuous renal replacement therapies. However, experience with SLED therapies in metformin poisoning is anecdotal.11 DISCUSSION Treating a patient with metformin-induced lactic acidosis can be complex if the patient's history or the clinical context in which this acid-base disorder develops is unknown, especially a history of chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, liver disease, and aggregated poisonings. Although few cases of hyperlactatemic metabolic acidosis secondary to the administration of metformin are reported in the literature, the statistics and incidence of this disease may be underestimated due to low suspicion by physicians when dealing with metabolic acidosis, especially in patients receiving metformin for any indication and in whom the dose has not been previously adjusted. In the cases reported, after ruling out other causes, the suspicion of lactic acidosis secondary to the administration of metformin in case number 1 was obtained due to the poor response to the initial treatment with renal replacement therapy, persisting with an acid pH and high lactate concentrations. In case number 2, the suspicion of lactic acidosis secondary to metformin was obtained because the patient had very high lactate concentrations on admission. The renal function of the two patients was most likely decreased prior to their hospital admission due to the time of evolution of their relevant history with more than 15 years of type 2 diabetes and systemic arterial hypertension. Although metformin concentrations were requested after the first hemodialysis session in case number 1 (41 \u00b5g/mL) and during the first hemodialysis session in case number 2 (12 \u00b5g/mL), we did not find another cause to explain such pronounced hyperlactatemia, such as sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, mesenteric thrombosis, uremia, poisoning by some other substance, etc. The decision to use CRRT as a second therapy option for the patient in case number 1 was mainly based on hemodynamic instability with good results from our experience. To date, there are no protocols that include CRRT dialysis as first-line treatment, probably due to the low availability and cost of the therapy in different medical centers. CONCLUSIONS Establishing an accurate and timely diagnosis of lactic acidosis due to metformin requires, as a first step, knowing the patient\u2019s most relevant history, especially that which includes diseases that affect renal or hepatic function. Second, it is important to rule out any other condition that manifests in conjunction with high anion gap metabolic acidosis in the diagnostic approach. There is no doubt that the treatment of choice for this disease is renal replacement therapy. Choosing the best treatment modality depends on the availability of the different therapies, the patient's hemodynamic status, costs, and experience of the different types of dialysis treatment in the different care centers.

Pedro(1); S\u00f3nia Duarte(1); Teresa Leal(1) (1) Centro Hospitalar do Porto, EPE / Hospital Geral de Santo Ant\u00f3nio    Background: Anaphylatic shock is a truly life-threatning medical emergency and its succefully approach depends on its early recognition and treatment Patient's history may be crucial in identifying the causative agent. Case description: 54-year-old female, ASA III, known allergies to paracetamol, diclofenac and nimesulide and a history of nickel\u2019s contact dermatitis, with no reports of complicated anesthesia. She was admitted for cervical conization, and the procedure was successful and uneventful under monitored anaesthesia care with fentanyl and propofol as well as analgesia with tramadol. During conization, adrenaline was infiltrated in the cervix and hemostasis was performed with packing soaked in Monsel\u00b4s solution. The immediate postoperative period in the PACU were uneventful and no drugs were administered during this period; the patient was discharged to the ward. 3 hours later, she reported progressive dyspnea, with desaturation and maculopapular exanthema. Anesthesia medical emergency was activated. On arrival the patient presented: A \u2013 marked oedema of the lips and tongue; B - respiratory distress, SpO2 82% (with MAC), vesicular murmur audible but diminished in all fields, without bronchospasm; C \u2013 BP:60/40mmHg; increased capillary refill time (4-5seg); D \u2013 GCS 14; E - generalized maculopapular exanthema and oedema of the eyelids. Anaphylactic shock was immediately diagnosed without identified causative agent. 0.5mg adrenaline im, 200mg hydrocortisone ev, 2mg clemastine ev and profuse fluid therapy were administered. There was initial slight improvement followed by subsequent worsening. Additional administration of 0.5mg adrenaline im and 125mg methylprednisolone ev provided similar results.  Considering that no new drugs were administered in the ward, the emergency team and the attending gynecologist assumed an association between nickel allergy and the chemical composition of Monsel's solute, remained for hemostasis after the surgery. Thus, it was decided to remove the packing soaked in Monsel\u00b4s solute from the vaginal cavity and washed it with saline solution. After the removal the packing with solution and further administration of 0.5mg adrenaline im, there was progressive improvement of the blood pressure and SpO2. Tryptases collected 1h latter were increased (23,9ug/L, N <11,4ug/L). The patient was transported to the ICU for surveillance, from which she was discharged 2 days, with scheduled immunoallergology consultation, that is waiting. Discussion: The identification of the causative agent represents a key point in the resolution of the anaphylactic shock. When specific materials are used, like Monsel\u00b4s solution, discussion among professionals is critical for the correct interpretation and resolution of the case. It is important to keep in mind that topical agents might be the cause. Monsel\u00b4s solution is a topic hemostatic agent, based on ferrous sulfate, which can be applied directly to the surgical site after excision of the lesion. Learning Points:  \u2022 approach to the patient with anaphylactic shock; \u2022 importance of peer discussion for the correct diagnosis and treatment of the patient; \u2022 importance of clinical history in diagnosing the causal agent of anaphylaxis; \u2022 importance of monitoring patients in the postoperative period and after the administration of any drug.

Methods: A 53-year-old female (68 in, 72 kg, BMI 24 kg/m2) presents to an academic tertiary care hospital for management of gastroparesis in the setting of an abdominal wall fluid collection. Pertinent past medical history includes chronic vomiting, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adrenal insufficiency, and enterocutaneous fistula. Of note, the patient was taking hydrocortisone 2.5 mg PO TID prior to admission and received varying doses of hydrocortisone and prednisone from POD0 through POD8 for stress dosing and pre-medication for contrast allergy. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, gastrostomy tube placement, and feeding jejunostomy tube (J-tube) placement. On POD6 she returned to surgery for an exploratory laparotomy to remove a dysfunctional J-tube and takedown of her jejunal-cutaneous fistula. On POD7 from her index surgery, 3-in-1 PN was initiated for persistent enteric leak and need for bowel rest. Baseline serum triglyceride (TG) level prior to PN initiation was 162 mg/dL. Goal PN formulation contained 94 grams of amino acids, 365 g of dextrose, and 58 grams of soy ILE providing 30 kcal/kg/day. On PN Day 5, TG rose to 423 mg/dL, and ILE was removed from the PN formulation. On PN Day 8, levocarnitine (300 mg) was added to the 2-in-1 PN. On PN Day 9, fenofibrate was initiated (160 mg). TG continued to rise despite withholding ILE, peaking at 1959 mg/dL on PN Day 11. TG began to downtrend on PN Day 12, reaching a nadir of 198 mg/dL on PN Day 21. Results: Visschers and colleagues describe a cohort of 40 patients receiving PN with serum triglycerides >400 mg/dL. The average TG level while receiving ILE-based PN was 471 mg/dL. ILE was subsequently withheld in these patients for a median of 5 days (range of 1-23 days) resulting in a decrease in average serum triglycerides to 265 mg/dL. Our patient's PN contained soy-based ILE at a dose of 0.8mg/kg actual body weight and continued to rise despite ILE removal, reaching <400mg/dL on PN Day 21. Potential causes of this persistent rising hypertriglyceridemia include long-term steroid therapy; high-dose steroids perioperatively; stress-induced state of carnitine deficiency; idiopathic response to intralipid; or some combination of the above. Corticosteroid therapy has been shown to increase triglycerides. Hormone-sensitive lipase prevalent in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and adrenal tissue converts triglycerides in the liver into cholesterol. Like dietary triglycerides, clearance of soy ILE is dependent on lipoprotein lipase concentrations and typically clears from serum within 60-80 minutes. Carnitine functions as a carrier molecule that facilitates transport of fatty acids into cells. Fenofibrate increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase. Conclusion: Routine monitoring of TG is imperative for patients initiated on ILE-based PN formulations. Unfortunately, there is a lack of management algorithm for treatment of PN-induced Record downloaded - Tue May 30 04:21:22 UTC 2023 Page 3 hypertriglyceridemia.

Effects of phenobarbital, potassium bromide and topiramate on intractable epilepsies in two cases of holoprosencephaly. Epilepsy and Seizure. 2023;15(1):35-41 on 31 May 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Japan and concerns a 03-year-old female patient (case 1) who experienced serious adverse reactions of increased salivation, aggravation of aspiration pneumonia, and diabetes insipidus associated with diazepam, nitrazepam, and clonazepam. The patient with semi lobar holoprosencephaly (HPE) and cleft lip/ palate had onset of epilepsy since birth and had been treated with levetiracetam (LEV) 300 mg and zonisamide (ZNS) 60 mg. Clusters of tonic seizures occurred weekly in her infancy, necessitating abortive medications of rectal diazepam (DZP) 3 mg and/or chloral hydrate. At three years of age, the patient had profound psychomotor developmental delay and spastic tetraplegia. However, she was able to make eye contact with caregivers and smile and would cry with vocalization when uncomfortable events occurred. Tonic seizures with desaturation became more common during this period but were reduced after increasing the dose of nitrazepam (NZP) (2 mg from 1.2 mg) and starting clonazepam (CZP) 0.4 mg. However, possibly as a result of increased salivation due to benzodiazepines, the patient experienced repeated aspiration pneumonia, which further led to the development of diabetes insipidus (DI). Convulsive status epilepticus (SE) occurred in several occasions, and phenobarbital (PB) was added to the antiepileptic regimen. Seizures manifested at this time as repetitive blinking, eye fixation and/or upward gaze, vertical (upbeat) or horizontal nystagmus, grinning facial distortion, and facial flushing, in various combinations lasting up to one minute, evolving to generalized tonic seizures several times per day. These seizures were frequently triggered by auditory or soma-to-sensory stimuli, such as oropharyngeal suctioning. Ictal electroencephalography (EEG) revealed bilateral frontopolar fast activity at seizure onset with blinking, ocular fixation, and eyelid flutter; followed by desynchronization and the emergence of wide-spread 1.5\u20132 Hz slow activity during the generalized tonic phase with upward gaze. Furthermore, the patient frequently displayed irregular horizontal nystagmus at 0.5\u20132 Hz frequency. The patient\u2019s responsiveness appeared to be partially impaired and salivation increased during nystagmus lasting several seconds or longer. The EEG during this state revealed epileptiform paroxysms with frontopolar predominance, occurring simultaneously with each beat of nystagmus. This condition was uncountable due to the insidious onset and lingering nature, occupying up to half of the daytime. In retrospect, this symptom had been present daily since her infancy and could be classified as SE with minor focal seizures. The patient experienced varying degrees of unconsciousness daily, due to (1) the minor SE, (2) changes in sodium levels caused by DI, (3) somnolence from antiepileptics (please refer to the linked case # JP-MLMSERVICE-20230605-4324792-2), and/or (4) sleep-wake cycle disorder as a complication of HPE. Consciousness and epilepsy control could be improved by CZP, ZNS, and LEV discontinuation, DZP dose reduction, PB dosage adjustment, and DI management. However, frequent convulsive and nonconvulsive SE have been exacerbated again after PB dosage reduction, and the effects of lamotrigine (LTG) and lacosamide (LCM) were equivocal. Finally, administration of potassium bromide (KBr) 50 mg/kg/day and topiramate (TPM) 3 mg/ kg/day resulted in the disappearance of convulsive SE, reduced frequency of minor SE, and sustained wakefulness during daytime. Up to 70% of HPE patients have central DI, which is caused by disturbed hypothalamic separation and/or dysgenesis. This complication may progress over time, as seen in this case. Disturbed consciousness caused by sodium level changes prompted aspiration of excessive saliva, which was caused by either the adverse effect of benzodiazepines or the peri-ictal phenomenon associated with non-convulsive SE. Aggravation of pneumonia then worsened the central DI. This vicious cycle could be ended by reducing benzodiazepine dosage and maintaining a prone position for sputum expectoration during the daytime. This allowed adequate evaluation of somnolence caused by antiepileptic drugs and prompted further trials for epilepsy control and alertness enhancement. Follow-up information has been requested.

A) 75 year-old Chinese female with type 2 diabetes was admitted in April 2020 with Covid-19 and diabetic ketoacidosis. Glucose was 35mmol/l and HbA1c 150mmol/mol with previous HbA1c of 45mmol/mol on metformin and alogliptin. She was treated for ketoacidosis and once-daily Lantus introduced along with supportive management of viral illness. B) 68 year-old Afro- Caribbean with type 2 diabetes on metformin before admission, presented with new onset, jerky ballistic movements of high amplitude in right arm, 10-15 movements every 5 min. Admission glucose was >33mmol/l, ketones 1.8mmol/l and HbA1c >217mmol/ mol. Hemichorea-hemiballism, a hyperglycaemia related movement was diagnosed and insulin commenced. Glucose decreased to 8-20mmol/ l, reaching 5-15mmol/ l by time of discharge. Ballistic movements resolved when glycaemic control improved with HbA1c 169mmol/mol, 25 days after discharge. C) Several days before admission, a female with diabetes over 20 years required attention from paramedics on four occasions for hypoglycaemia. Months beforehand metformin was replaced by gliclazide due to chronic kidney disease with HbA1c 50mmol/mol, and she was transfused six weeks before admission for microcytic anaemia. Gliclazide was discontinued and her diet modified which prevented further hypoglycaemic episodes. Variant haemoglobin, \u03b2- thalassaemia which can overestimate glycaemia; undetected by HbA1c HPLC method, invalidated HbA1c as did the blood transfusion. These cases highlight that inadequate Record downloaded - Fri Jun 09 05:32:49 UTC 2023 Page 3 understanding of HbA1c can lead to acute presentations of dysglycaemia.

Patients diagnosed with UC often have a poor prognosis. To date, there is no standardized treatment. Our objective is to present two cases of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) secondary to an UC, who were treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic peroperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). A review of the literature on CRS and HIPEC in UC suggests CRS and HIPEC to be a safe and viable treatment option. Two patients with PC of UC underwent CRS and HIPEC in our institution. All available data were gathered and reported on. A literary search was carried out to find all available cases of patients with PC secondary to UC treated with CRS and HIPEC. Both patients underwent CRS and HIPEC and are currently free of recurrence. Literature research revealed nine other publications adding up to a total of 68 additional cases. CRS and HIPEC can provide satisfactory long-term oncological outcome with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates in patients with PC of urachal origin. It should be considered as a safe and feasible treatment option with curative potential. Keywords Urachal carcinoma \u00b7 Peritoneal carcinomatosis \u00b7 Cytoreductive surgery \u00b7 HIPEC Introduction Urachal carcinoma (UC) is a rare and aggressive cancer that often presents in advanced stages of disease. It accounts for only 0.35\u20130.70% of all bladder cancers and 0.01% of all adult malignancies and has an incidence of approximately one case per million per year [1]\u2013[5]. UC can present at any age. A review with meta-analysis of 1010 cases by Szarvas et al. [1] showed a median age at presentation of 52 years (range 20\u201390 years). In addition, there are a few cases where UC is described in newborns and children. The extravesical and extraperitoneal locations of UC make for a clinically silent character, resulting in diagnosis often at advanced tumor stages. The meta-analysis by Szarvas et al. reported lymph node metastasis in 17% and primary metastatic disease in 21% of patients [1, 6]. Most often distant organ metastases present in the lungs, the bones, and the peritoneum [1, 6]. The aim of this manuscript is to present two cases of patients with an UC with isolated peritoneal metastases. Both patients were treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic peroperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Second, a review of the available medical literature on the treatment of this entity is presented. Case Presentation 1 A 49-year-old man was referred to our institution because of findings of a large, mostly preperitoneal located, mass. In his surgical history, we only withheld vasectomy. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large (approximately 8 cm) circumscript mass lesion in the hypogastrium.

Hernandez-Cruz B, Munoz AHA, Machuca-Aguado J, Gallardo SR, et al. Refractory multisystemic sarcoidosis, a diagnosis and treatment challenge: a case report. Journal of Medical Case Reports. 2023;17(1):303 on 10 Jul 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Spain and concerns a 38-year-old Spanish female patient who experienced a serious adverse reaction of hepatotoxicity associated with methotrexate. The patient was a current smoker, with hypothyroidism and obesity (90 kg, BMI 35) and was referred in March 2021 from Primary Care to the Internal Medicine Department. She had a persistent fever for 5 days (38\u00b0-39 \u00b0C) and asthenia. The first evaluation revealed the presence of fever, parotid enlargement, bilateral anterior uveitis, and peripheral facial palsy on the left side. In the chest X-ray, it was noticed the presence of bilateral hilar adenopathies, with better visualization in the thorax tomography. The blood tests showed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) value of 77 U/L (normal value 12-40); the rest of parameters: hemogram, liver and renal test, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c reactive protein (CRP), serum calcium, ferritin, proteinogram, serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test, antinuclear antibodies and several autoimmune tests were negative. Urine, blood, and sputum cultures were negative. With the clinical manifestations and the complementary tests, the diagnosis of Heerfordt syndrome as a manifestation of acute sarcoidosis was established. Since the syndrome with pulmonary hilar adenopathies is considered pathognomonic of sarcoidosis, it was decided to treat without histopathology confirmation. Oral prednisone was prescribed at a dose of 30 mg/day, for two months with subsequent control. In the first evaluation after a month of treatment, she was better. The fever and the parotid enlargement had subsided, and the left facial palsy improved. The ophthalmological evaluation showed resolution of the uveitis, with normal ocular examination. However, she had new clinical data: headache, dizziness, and upper limb paresthesia. Her blood count, chemistry tests, ESR, CRP, urine and thorax X-Ray were normal. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal results. In addition, the upper limb electroneurogram showed sensitive involvement in the median nerve at the level of the right carpal tunnel. As no neurological involvement of sarcoidosis was demonstrated and other possible causes of the symptoms were ruled out, prednisone was continued at 30 mg/day for a month more with subsequent taper until discontinuation in 2 months. In June 2021 she was evaluated, and all her symptoms had resolved. However, four days after discontinuing glucocorticoids, she consulted again for decreased vision, pain, and ocular erythema. A bilateral panuveitis was diagnosed (positive Tyndall, posterior synechiae, vitreous condensation and papilla thickening) by eye fundus examination and Optical Coherence Tomography. She was treated with topical glucocorticoids and cycloplegics. One week later, the patient presented worsening of her uveitis symptoms in addition to a fever of 38 \u00b0C. The patient was admitted and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulses at a dose of 500 mg/day for 3 days. The ophthalmologic response was very satisfactory, with remission of pain, and almost complete recovery of visual acuity. After discussing the case in the Multidisciplinary Committee of Autoimmune Diseases, it was decided to add to the treatment methotrexate (20 mg/week SC) and adalimumab (40 mg/2 weeks SC), in addition to prednisone (20 mg/day PO). A month later the patient reported improvement of her symptoms: no fever, improvement of her visual acuity. Her paresthesias had also improved. It was decided to maintain the dosage of the prescribed medication. In August 2021 she consulted several times due to persistent headache, fever, and asthenia. It was decided to increase the daily dose of oral prednisone from 20 to 1 mg/Kg/day (80 mg) for 10 days in addition to methotrexate and adalimumab. A month later she continued with the same symptoms and was admitted for monitoring and to rule out other possible etiology (i. e. central nervous system infection). During the admission the patient presented with a fever of 38 C and a persistent holocranial headache. Occasionally she presented anomia and paraphasias. Ophthalmological examination showed new signs of uveitis. The patient reported adequate compliance with methotrexate and adalimumab treatment. Her blood tests showed hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL (normal value 13-16), ESR 46 mm/h (normal value 0-20), CRP 0.7 mg/L (normal value\u2009<\u20095) aspartate transaminase (AST) 140 IU/L (normal value 0-37), alanine transaminase (ALT) 225 IU/L (normal value 0-40), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 20 U/L (normal value 12-40) Ca 3.9 mEq/L (normal value 8.5-10.5). Urine, blood, and sputum cultures were negative. Other tests: ferritin, proteinogram, serology for HIV, HBV, HCV, HEV, QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test, antinuclear antibodies and autoimmune tests were normal or negative. Lumbar puncture was performed with 30 leukocytes (90% mononuclear), glucose, proteins, and normal adenosine deaminase. In addition to negativity for Gram, acid, and alcohol fast bacilli (AAFB), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for enterovirus and mycobacteria, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella herpes virus (VHZ); antineuronal antibodies were negative. The electroencephalogram was normal. Brain MRI and AngioMRI showed scarce punctate images with a signal of hyperintensity in the subcortical white matter of frontal predominance in relation to possible demyelination/nonspecific gliosis, without foci of restriction, space-occupying lesions, or hemorrhagic foci. Echobronchoscopy showed subcarinal lymphadenopathies. A needle aspiration biopsy of hiliar thoracic lymphadenopathies was performed, and the result showed granulomatous lymphadenitis of sarcoid type. Cytology and microbiology samples were negative. Flow cytometry showed no alteration of the T lymphocytes, and non-Hodgkin B lymphoma was ruled out. The case was discussed again in the Multidisciplinary Committee of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases. It was decided to discontinue methotrexate, due to hepatotoxicity. Given the suspicion of neurological sarcoidosis, adalimumab was changed to cyclophosphamide plus infliximab. After obtaining informed consent, methylprednisolone boluses were prescribed (500 mg/day for 3 days IV), followed by cyclophosphamide (500 mg/ each 2 weeks IV) and infliximab (450 mg/each cycle IV-5 mg/Kg weight-at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 8 weeks. A subsequent dose of prednisone of 15 mg/day PO. After 3 months of this treatment, she had no fever normal, normal visual acuity and headache decreased. As a sequel, her right eye had mydriasis and snowballs in the eye fundus examination. The patient noticed an improvement in the intensity of the initial symptoms of her disease with the treatments administered. However, she noticed a decrease in her quality of life. The patient follow-up continues. The author reported a case of sarcoidosis with pulmonary, ocular, and probable nervous system involvement, with poor response to conventional treatment. In whom more than one biologic therapy was used until an acceptable response was achieved. Most cases of sarcoidosis are mild, and its treatment does not entail a major problem for the physician. On other occasions, the involvement can be multisystemic and severe. In this situation it is important to make a correct diagnosis and early treatment directed according to the affected organ, the patient must have close monitoring to avoid complications and sequelae leading to decreased quality.

Journal of Medical Case Reports Refractory multisystemic sarcoidosis, a diagnosis and treatment challenge: a case report Jorge Luis Rodas Flores1*, Enrique Peral Guti\u00e9rrez de Ceballos2, Blanca Hern\u00e1ndez\u2011Cruz1 , Alejandro Hern\u00e1n Alvarez Mu\u00f1oz3, Jes\u00fas Machuca\u2011Aguado3, Salvador Recio Gallardo4 and Jos\u00e9 Javier Perez Venegas1 Abstract Background Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown origin. It is characterized by abnormal activation of lymphocytes and macrophages with the formation of granulomas. Most cases have asymptomatic pulmonary involvement. In case of symptoms, they have an excellent response to glucocorticoid therapy. We present a case of sarcoidosis with multi-organ involvement, refractory to multiple treatments including biological. Partial remission was achieved in it. Case presentation We report an interesting case of a 38-years-old Spanish woman treated by Heerfordt\u2019s syndrome (uveitis, parotiditis, fever and facial palsy) plus pulmonary hiliar adenopathy. A sarcoidosis diagnosis was confirmed by lung biopsy. She was initially treated with an 8 weeks course of medium dose oral glucocorticoids and tapered over 8 weeks with improvement. After the suspension of glucocorticoids a relapse occurs with severe ocular involvement and suspicion of neurological involvement. The patient received multiple lines of treatment with poor response. Finally, after the combination of cyclophosphamide with infliximab, the uveitis resolved, improving the neurological symptoms. Conclusions Sarcoidosis is a benign disease in most cases. In a small percentage of cases behaves aggressively, requiring early diagnosis and immunosuppressive treatment to avoid sequelae. An adequate immunosuppressive therapy based on Anti TNF drugs should be started to minimize damage and improve the quality of life.The choice of treatment depends on the type and severity of the disease. Keywords Refractory sarcoidosis, Methotrexate, Adalimumab, Infliximab, Case report Background Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology [1]. It is characterized by the abnormal activation of CD4 T lymphocytes and macrophages. These cells accumulate in the affected tissues, where they lead to the formation of granulomas. These cells produce various proinflammatory cytokines responsible for the clinical manifestations and complications of the disease. Sarcoidosis can affect several organs and systems, and the lungs are the most frequently affected [2, 3]. *Correspondence: Jorge Luis Rodas Flores jor_gerodas@outlook.com 1 Rheumatology Department,

This case was also detected by PFIZERINC on 22/06/2023 and transmitted to Eudravigilance on 28/06/2023 with case number FR-PFIZER INC-202300232462. In accordance with the MLM service duplicate management process, this case is based on that first E2B transmission. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from France and concerns a 40-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of renal function deteriorated, increased creatinine levels at 270-290 umol/L and new onset proteinuria associated with tacrolimus and posaconazole interactions. The patient was referred to the Department of Infectious Diseases of the hospital, Paris, France, with a suspicion of lower limb subcutaneous fungal infection. Her medical history was significant for renal transplantation 8 years previously, due to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and for chronic idiopathic liver disease. She received mycophenolic acid (360 mg bid), tacrolimus (2 mg qd), and prednisone (5 mg qd) for post-transplant prophylaxis. Post-transplant follow-up had been notable for acute humoral rejection and BK virus nephropathy and baseline creatinine levels were 200 umol/L (estimated renal clearance 25 mL/min). Five months prior to the presentation, the patient had returned from a 10-day trip to India, during which she reported falling in a sewage ditch and wounding her right leg. Upon her return, the patient was given a 5-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Over the ensuing 3 months, the wound had reportedly healed. One month later, the patient reported skin redness and a discharge of pus. A skin swab sample performed in an outpatient setting yielded growth of Scedosporium spp. On admission, the patient was afebrile and in good overall condition. Dermatological examination revealed a 5 cm-long heterogeneous erythematous and pigmented infiltrated plaque of the right tibial crest area, with a single ecchymotic nodule. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen revealed suppurative granulomas in the subcutaneous fat associating 2 morphologically distinct fungal pathogens, including small, pigmented hyphae evocative of phaeohyphomycosis and larger yeast-like pathogens with budding and internal septation. No mycetoma grains were observed. Mycological cultures yielded the growth of Exophiala spp., which was identified as Exophiala jeanselmei by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) locus. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) broth microdilution method following the E.DEF 9.3.2 procedure (1), with some modifications (2), and showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, and caspofungin of 0.5 mg/l, 0.06 mg/l, 0.25 mg/l, and 4 mg/l, respectively. Computed tomography of the leg showed no evidence of osteitis, and full-body imaging showed no dissemination. The patient was started on oral voriconazole (200 mg bid). Within 48 h, the patient\u2019s liver function deteriorated (alanine transaminase (ALT) levels 11 times the upper normal limit), and voriconazole was suspended. After 10 days, treatment was switched to posaconazole (200 mg qd). Despite 2 months of antifungals and with trough levels of posaconazole within the therapeutic range, pus was still discharging from the lesion, and skin biopsies showed persistent granulomatous inflammation. Mycological cultures yielded growth of Scedosporium apiospermum (MIC 0.5, 0.5, 0.125 and 1 mg/L for voriconazole, posaconazole, micafungin, and caspofungin, respectively). In addition, the patient\u2019s renal function had deteriorated, partly due to drug-drug interactions between tacrolimus and posaconazole, with increased creatinine levels at 270-290 umol/L and new-onset proteinuria. Surgical debridement of the lesion was not deemed a viable option, due to the large surface of the affected area. Instead, antifungal treatment was intensified, with a 3-week course of intravenous caspofungin (50 mg qd) in addition to the posaconazole treatment, and daily topical 1% voriconazole cream was applied with an occlusive patch (details of this procedure were described previously. Antifungal treatment was stopped at the end of a 6-month treatment course. Ten months later, local inflammatory symptoms relapsed. Mycological cultures from new skin biopsy specimens once again yielded colonies of Exophiala jeanselmei. In the absence of locoregional invasion and dissemination, it opted to treat the patient exclusively with topical voriconazole. Over 6 months, local inflammatory signs progressively abated, leaving a heterogeneously hyperpigmented scar. The patient is currently without treatment and has reported no signs of relapse after more than 1 year of follow-up. Scedosporium apiospermum and Exophiala jeanselmei are ubiquitous fungi commonly isolated from environmental substrates, such as soil (S. apiospermum and E. jeanselmei), sewage, and polluted waters (S. apiospermum), and have been reported as causing chronic subcutaneous lesions after direct inoculation. Management of these infections in immunocompromised individuals generally relies on surgical debridement when lesions are small and localized, in association with systemic triazoles to prevent dissemination. Although usually not life-threatening, these infections may be challenging to manage in immunocompromised patients, especially when long-term systemic antifungals cannot be administered due to toxicity or to concerns regarding drug-drug interactions. In this case, the use of triazole treatment was limited by renal and liver toxicity and was only partially effective. Subcutaneous hyalohyphomycoses and phaeohyphomycoses can be challenging to manage in solid-organ transplant recipients because of drug toxicities and drug-drug interactions. The author reported a case of mixed subcutaneous infection caused by Scedosporium and Exophiala, which was successfully managed using a combination of systemic antifungals and a topical 1% voriconazole preparation.

We report here a case of mixed subcutaneous infection caused by Scedosporium and Exophiala, which was successfully managed using a combination of systemic antifungals and a topical 1% voriconazole preparation. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old woman was referred to the department of Infectious Diseases of Necker - Enfants Malades hospital, Paris, France, with a suspicion of lower limb subcutaneous fungal infection. Her medical history was significant for renal transplantation 8 years previously, due to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and for chronic idiopathic liver disease. She received mycophenolic acid (360 mg bid), tacrolimus (2 mg qd), and prednisone (5 mg qd) for post-transplant prophylaxis. Post-transplant follow-up had been notable for acute humoral rejection and BK virus nephropathy, and baseline creatinine levels were 200 \u03bcmol/L (estimated renal clearance 25 mL/min). Five months prior to presentation, the patient had returned from a 10-day trip to India, during which she reported falling in a sewage ditch and wounding her right leg. Upon her return, the patient was given a 5-day course of amoxicillinclavulanic acid. Over the ensuing 3 months, the wound had reportedly healed. One month later, the patient reported skin redness and a discharge of pus. A skin swab sample performed in an outpatient setting yielded growth of Scedosporium spp. On admission, the patient was afebrile and in good overall condition. Dermatological examination revealed a 5 cm-long heterogeneous erythematous and pigmented infiltrated plaque of the right tibial crest area, with a single ecchymotic nodule (Fig. 1A). Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen revealed suppurative granulomas in the subcutaneous fat associating 2 morphologically distinct fungal pathogens, including small pigmented hyphae evocative of phaeohyphomycosis and larger yeast-like pathogens with budding and internal septation (Fig. 1D\u2013F). No mycetoma grains were observed. Mycological cultures yielded growth of Exophiala spp., which was identified as Exophiala jeanselmei by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) locus. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) broth microdilution method following the E.DEF 9.3.2 procedure (1), with some modifications (2), and showed minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole, and caspofungin of 0.5 mg/l, 0.06 mg/l, 0.25 mg/l, and 4 mg/l, respectively. Computed tomography of the leg showed no evidence of osteitis, and full-body imaging showed no dissemination.

Advances in dermatology and venereology ActaDV Acta Dermato-Venereologica ActaDV 2/3 Short communication Acta Derm Venereol 2023 started on oral voriconazole (200 mg bid). Within 48 h, the patient\u2019s liver function deteriorated (alanine transaminase (ALT) levels 11 times the upper normal limit), and voriconazole was suspended. After 10 days, treatment was switched to posaconazole (200 mg qd). Despite 2 months of antifungals and with trough levels of posaconazole within therapeutic range, pus was still discharging from the lesion, and skin biopsies showed persistent granulomatous inflammation. Mycological cultures yielded growth of Scedosporium apiospermum (MIC 0.5, 0.5, 0.125 and 1 mg/L for voriconazole, posaconazole, micafungin, and caspofungin, respectively). In addition, the patient\u2019s renal function had deteriorated, partly due to drug-drug interactions between tacrolimus and posaconazole, with increased creatinine levels at 270\u2013290 \u03bcmol/L and new-onset proteinuria. Surgical debridement of the lesion was not deemed a viable option, due to the large surface of the affected area. Instead, antifungal treatment was intensified, with a 3-week course of intravenous caspofungin (50 mg qd) in addition to the posaconazole treatment, and daily topical 1% voriconazole cream was applied with an occlusive patch (details of this procedure were described previously (3)). Antifungal treatment was stopped at the end of a 6-month treatment course. Ten months later, local inflammatory symptoms relapsed. Mycological cultures from new skin biopsy specimen once again yielded colonies of Exophiala jeanselmei. In the absence of locoregional invasion and dissemination, it was opted to treat the patient exclusively with topical voriconazole. Over 6 months, local inflammatory signs progressively abated, leaving a heterogeneously hyperpigmented scar (Fig. 1C). The patient is currently without treatment, and has reported no signs of relapse after more than 1 year of follow-up. DISCUSSION Scedosporium apiospermum and Exophiala jeanselmei are ubiquitous fungi commonly isolated from environmental substrates, such as soil (S. apiospermum and E. jeanselmei), sewage, and polluted waters (S. apiospermum), and have been reported as causing chronic subcutaneous lesions after direct inoculation (4, 5). Management of these infections in immunocompromised individuals generally relies on surgical debridement when lesions are small and localized, in association with systemic triazoles to prevent dissemination (4\u20136). Although usually not life-threatening, these infections may be challenging to manage in immunocompromised patients (5), especially when long-term systemic antifungals cannot be administered due to toxicity or to concerns regarding drug-drug interactions (7). In this case, the use of triazole treatment was limited by renal and liver toxicity, and was only partially effective. Our group recently reported a case of cutaneous infection by Fusarium spp. in a patient with hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome, linked to STAT3 deficiency, managed using this novel topical voriconazole formulation, combined with oral treatment (3). This voriconazole skin cream formulation was shown to be stable over time, and allowed for successful management of infection first in combination with oral voriconazole, and then alone as maintenance therapy (3). We believe that the topical formulation of voriconazole could allow for sustained release of high concentrations of antifungals at the site of infection, which could explain why it may have been more effective than the initial systemic treatment. It is, however, unclear at present whether clinical improvement was solely due to the topical formulation, or rather to the combination of topical and systemic antifungals. It is also important to note that the use of topical formulations of voriconazole should be reserved for the treatment of limited cutaneous mycoses, as its penetration into deep tissue planes is expected to be limited. We consider that, in the absence of locoregional dissemination, topical voriconazole may be of value in the tailored management of localized phaeohyphomycoses or hyalohyphomycoses in immunocompromised patients, in association with systemic antifungals during initial treatment or in place of long-term systemic antifungals when these are poorly tolerated. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We would like to thank Dea Garcia-Hermoso and Marie-Elisabeth Bougnoux for their assistance with the identification of the fungal species, Pr Dany Anglicheau for helping care for the patient, and Pr Salvatore Cisternino and Dr Joel Schlatter for their participation in providing the topical voriconazole formulation.

Secondary Hypertension Induced by Vitamin D3: A Case Report and Literature Review. Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Research. 2023;9(2):163-8 on 10 July 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Iran and concerns a 37-year-old male patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of secondary hypertension, acute hypercalcemia and renal failure due to colecalciferol intoxication. The patient was a bodybuilder and was referred to the emergency department with acute headache as the major complaint. The blood pressure was measured at 180/100 mmHg during the routine examinations. Further investigations revealed that he had weekly taken vitamin, testosterone, and corticosteroid injections for a few months. He was admitted to the hospital for better control of hypertension and an investigation of renal function. According to the initial physical examination, weight, height, and heart rate were 120 kg, 1.83 cm, and 60 bpm, respectively. Initial laboratory tests, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, blood sugar, calcium, albumin, ionized calcium, total bilirubin, potassium, sodium, C-reactive protein, and parathyroid hormone levels were requested. All these tests were in the normal situation except for the calcium and the serum creatinine levels. Laboratory tests before hospitalization and on the day of hospitalization 30 days before hospitalization: Creatinine: 4.34 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL). 14 days before hospitalization: Calcium: 11 mg/dL (8.4-10.4 mg/dL), Ionized Calcium: 1.38 mmol/L (1.14-1.31 mmol/L), Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL). Day of hospitalization: Calcium: 11.9 mg/dL (8.4-10.4 mg/dL), Ionized Calcium: 1.38 mmol/L (1.14-1.31 mmol/L), Parathyroid Hormone: 10.3 pg/mL (12.0-65.0 pg/mL), Creatinine: 2.4 mg/dL (0.6-1.2 mg/dL). Considering the increase of creatinine in serum, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the modification of diet in the renal disease equation and the result was 30.6 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2. On the other hand, the eGFR was calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation with the adjusted body weight and the result was 46.3 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2. The patient was reported for ultrasonography and hydronephrosis grade I in both kidneys. Acute renal failure (ARF) was initially considered because of the decrease in the eGFR, the increase in the calcium level, and the hydronephrosis diagnosed in ultrasonography; however, other symptoms of renal failure, such as fluid retention, confusion, nausea, uremia, and irregular heartbeat were not observed. The laboratory tests for bone metabolism were inconclusive, and PTH inappropriately persisted at normal levels even with hypercalcemia. Considering that the patient had taken 300000 IU vitamin D3 (intramuscular injection) per week for a few months before admission to the hospital, the laboratory diagnosis was probably influenced by renal failure or the possible vitamin D3 intoxication. Therefore, the 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 level was measured, and the result was 160 ng/mL. Labetalol was used for the hypertension crisis and after controlling the blood pressure, the following managements were prescribed: Hyperhydration, administration of furosemide, and corticosteroid (prednisolone 25 mg once a day). This treatment was useful, and the serum creatinine decreased slowly. Amlodipine (5 mg twice a day) was also used to control hypertension during the hospitalization and the patient was discharged after 5 days by the same drug (amlodipine 5 mg once a day). During the follow-up and the evaluation of the patient for one year, his blood pressure was controlled by amlodipine. The laboratory results dropped and the vitamin D3 level decreased slowly as expected because of its elimination profile. After one year, amlodipine was discontinued, and the blood pressure was in the normal range for 2 months following the drug discontinuation. Laboratory tests after discharge from the hospital (during follow-up): Reference Range: Calcium: 8.4-10.4 mg/dL, Ionized Calcium: 1.14-1.31 mmol/L, Parathyroid Hormone: 12.0-65.0 pg/mL, Creatinine: 0.6-1.2 mg/dL, 1,25(OH)D: 30-100 ng/mL One month after discharge: Calcium: 9.5 mg/dL, Ionized Calcium: 1.19 mmol/L, Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL. Two months after discharge: Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL, Ionized Calcium: 1.15 mmol/L, Parathyroid Hormone: 19.3 pg/mL, Creatinine: 1.54 mg/dL, 1,25(OH)D: 126 ng/mL. Five months after discharge: Calcium: 9.8 mg/dL, Ionized Calcium: 1.30 mmol/L, Parathyroid Hormone: 9.14 pg/mL, Creatinine: 1.34 mg/dL, 1,25(OH)D: 70 ng/mL Ten months after discharge: Calcium: 9.8 mg/dL, Ionized Calcium: 1.30 mmol/L, Parathyroid Hormone: 20 pg/mL, Creatinine: 1.51 mg/dL, 1,25(OH)D: 88 ng/mL The level of vitamin D3 in this patient was 160 ng/mL; therefore, he had intoxication. While vitamin D3 intoxication is reported to be rare, the potential toxicity of high-dose vitamin D3 is not well understood or recognized among the general population. Vitamin D3 intoxication can usually occur when the vitamin D3 supplementation is overused, just like this patient. Symptoms of vitamin D3 intoxication include hypercalcemia (as in this case), hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, and headache. Hypertension and headache were the main symptoms of the presented case which were caused by hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia causes an increase in vascular resistance, especially in renal vascular. This mechanism is related to the direct effects of calcium on the calcium channel in vascular smooth muscle. Also, calcium induces hypercatecholaminemia. This condition can eventually lead to hypertension. At the beginning of vitamin D3 intoxication, tests show an elevated calcium level and an undetectable level of PTH. As over 100 ng/mL of the level of vitamin D3 in serum confirms intoxication, the major step in the treatment of vitamin D3 intoxication is to stop the intake of vitamin D3 and proscribes all foods, including calcium, such as milk. Patients with asymptomatic or mild symptomatic hypercalcemia (calcium < 12 mg/dL [3 mmol/L]) do not require immediate treatments. However, additional therapy depends mostly on the cause of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia is caused by the excess vitamin D3 lasting long; therefore, more aggressive therapies, such as glucocorticoids, zoledronic acid, or other bisphosphonates may be necessary. Clinical conditions that are often associated with vitamin D3 intoxication are related to ARF. Signs and symptoms of an acute kidney injury differ from fatigue, confusion, and nausea.

This case describes a pediatric female who was diagnosed with early-onset  schizophrenia and catatonia in her early adolescence, and was later found to have DLG4-related synaptopathy, also  known as SHINE syndrome. SHINE syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dysfunction of the  postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded by the DLG4 gene. After failing three antipsychotic drug treat\u0002ments, the patient was started on clozapine, which resulted in signifcant improvements in positive and negative  symptoms. This case illustrates the impact of clozapine in treatment-resistant early-onset psychosis and exemplifes  practical implications for genetic testing in early-onset schizophrenia. Keywords Synaptopathy, Clozapine, Early-onset, Treatment-resistant, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Genetic testing,  Pediatric Background Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), schizophrenia with  onset before 18 years old, Very Early Onset Schizophre\u0002nia (VEOS), schizophrenia with onset before 13  years  old, and psychotic symptoms in pediatric patients are  rare and require further workup to exclude primary psy\u0002chiatric and neurologic conditions, infectious processes,  and toxic or metabolic causes. While adult-onset schiz\u0002ophrenia has been studied in detail, research on EOS  is limited, partly due to its low prevalence and because  EOS was not recognized in the diagnostic systems before  the introduction of DSM-III in 1980. Te prevalence of  schizophrenia in children and adolescents is low, about  1.4 in 10,000 before the age of 15 [1, 2]. Te etiology of  EOS is not well understood because of the scant data on  this condition, and even less is known about the role of  genetic variations in EOS, which leads to the low inci\u0002dence of genetic testing in patient workup unless the  patient\u2019s family history includes schizophrenia [3]. One  rare genetic cause of EOS is SHINE syndrome. SHINE syndrome, also known as DLG4-related syn\u0002aptopathy, is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to dys\u0002function of the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95),  encoded by  DLG4. Te prevalence of this disorder is  unknown, with 53 patients confrmed in global literature  reviews [4]. PSD-95 regulates excitatory synaptic func\u0002tion, strength, and plasticity in the brain. It plays a key  role in brain development and function with major mod\u0002ulatory efects on glutamatergic synapses.

BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 2 of 5 these receptors alters excitatory synaptic transmission,  leading to positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.  Developmental regression is also a common symptom  amongst SHINE patients. In addition, several behavioral  issues including self-aggression, behavioral outbursts,  bipolar disorder, catatonia, and obsessive\u2013compulsive  disorder (OCD), have been described in conditions that  afect glutamatergic neuron activity [5, 6]. SHINE syndrome is an acronym for a common set  of symptoms seen in afected patients, including Sleep  disturbances, Hypotonia, Intellectual disability, Neu\u0002rological disorders, and Epilepsy [7]. Autistic features,  regression in motor and language skills, and psychosis  have been reported in less than half of cases. Psychosis  is not considered a cardinal feature of the condition. Our  understanding of the relationship between SHINE syn\u0002drome and early onset psychosis is limited, with fewer  than 10 documented cases in the literature. Case presentation An early-adolescent female with a past medical history  of learning disability diagnosed in 1st grade, presented to  the psychiatry clinic with a 7-month history of selective  mutism and depressed mood. She had an unremarkable birth history and had met  her motor milestones. She did not start speaking until  23 months, when she reportedly started speaking in age\u0002appropriate full sentences. In addition, she was reported  not to smile or interact as much as other children but  was still \u201ca happy and social child and made friends\u201d. Her  mother reported that she was diagnosed with a learning  disability in 1st grade and placed on an Individualized  Education Plan (IEP) for math and reading, but excelled  in those classes with A\u2019s and B\u2019s. At the time of the ini\u0002tial visit, she had recently started 8th grade. She enjoyed  gymnastics, tumbling, and cheerleading until October  of 2019. Menarche occurred at 13 years old, and menses  were irregular, with only 8 periods from 2019\u20132021. She  has a family history of bipolar I with psychotic features in  her paternal grandmother that responded well to quetia\u0002pine. Otherwise, family psychiatric history was negative.  She lives with her parents and 18-year-old brother and  has no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. At the initial visit, the patient softly told her parents  that \u201cTe Voice\u201d told her not to talk. She was diagnosed  with selective mutism and adjustment disorder at pres\u0002entation, started on sertraline and Cognitive Behavioral  Terapy (CBT). She continued to withdraw with ongoing  refusal to speak to family and peers. She began whisper\u0002ing to internal stimuli and displayed physical aggression  to her parents. Within a few months, she stopped par\u0002ticipating in self-care/hygiene and developed mixed cat\u0002atonia, with mutism, posturing, and agitation. She was  hospitalized and worked up for new-onset psychosis with  EEG, MRI, CT Abdomen, CT Chest, CT Pelvis, and CSF  studies with encephalitis panel, lysosomal enzyme panel,  CRP, ESR, and TPO antibody tests. All results were nor\u0002mal, and she was started on clonazepam and risperidone.  Risperidone 1  mg worsened her mutism, stereotypical  movements, and odd behaviors, and she stopped eat\u0002ing and drinking. Te risperidone was stopped while the  clonazepam continued. During this time, she minimally  interacted with others, and still responded to internal  stimuli. Tere was minimal improvement in her symp\u0002toms with clonazepam, but she was unable to tolerate  increased doses as it made her louder and more dif\u0002cult to manage. Decreasing clonazepam made her less  verbal, more withdrawn, and agitated. Oanzapine 5  mg  was added  with improvements in aggression and was  discharged with residual catatonia. However, at home  she would pace the house for hours, and frequently  tried to elope. She had a good appetite but was still fre\u0002quently responding to internal stimuli. Her catatonia  improved, and clonazepam was tapered of. Olanzapine  was increased with mild improvements in speech pro\u0002duction, and she was able to answer questions with one  to two-word responses. However, she was reported to  start throwing objects and screaming daily, particularly  at night, which interfered with her sleep. Her appetite  increased and her weight subsequently increased. She  was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia in March  2021. In June 2021, due to olanzapine\u2019s metabolic side  efects, she began metformin treatment to help with  weight gain, hyperlipidemia and elevated HgA1c. In November 2021, she started on a cross-titration  from olanzapine 7.5 mg daily to aripiprazole 20 mg daily  due to ongoing internal preoccupation and psychotic  symptoms. She also presented with signifcant side  efects of Parkinsonism and had a 30  lb weight gain on  olanzapine, limiting further titration. Although cross\u0002titration to aripiprazole helped her lose 5 lbs and normal\u0002ized her appetite, she began to have insomnia, regression  of speech, and worsening episodes of physical aggression.  In March 2022, she was restarted on olanzapine, which  stabilized her aggression but resulted in another 10  lb  weight gain. She was still responding to internal stimuli  and displayed prominent negative symptoms. She was evaluated in genetics clinic where she was  noted to be normally grown and minimally dysmor\u0002phic, with hypertelorism and a prominent nose. Her  early development history suggested that an underlying  genetic neurodevelopmental syndrome was responsible  for her psychosis. Te diferential diagnosis included  many chromosome disorders, most prominently  22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Neurometabolic disor\u0002ders other than Wilson disease, were also of concern as  Yang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 3 of 5 many are treatable. Genetic testing was ordered, includ\u0002ing a chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and  whole exome sequencing. Te CMA was normal but  the whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo muta\u0002tion in the gene DLG4, consistent with DLG4-related  synaptopathy also known as SHINE syndrome. Spe\u0002cifcally, she carries thep. (Arg660Ter) (CGA >TGA):  c. 1978 C>T in exon 19 of the DLG4 gene which is a  nonsense variant that is predicted to result in protein  truncation or decay. Tis variant has been observed de  novo without confrmed parentage in multiple unre\u0002lated patients with DLG4-related neurodevelopmental  disorder in the published literature [4]. Te patient also  carries a likely pathogenic variant in the MT-TA gene at  a 2% heteroplasmy level. Due to the low level of hetero\u0002plasmy, it is unknown whether she will exhibit symp\u0002toms of a mitochondrial disorder, although the typical  lower threshold for the presence of any mitochondrial  disease symptoms is 5% heteroplasmy. In May 2022, her parents consented to clozapine treat\u0002ment due to her treatment-refractory schizophrenia,  having trialed risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine.  Metformin was increased to 2000  mg daily, and poly\u0002ethylene glycol was started. Baseline studies for clozap\u0002ine safety monitoring were obtained. Troponin, ANC,  and CRP were within normal limits. EKG showed con\u0002cern for Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, and  after subsequent Holter monitoring for 30 days, she was  cleared by cardiology in July 2022 to begin clozapine  therapy. Because of the prevalence of autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) in SHINE syndrome, she was referred  for a formal autism evaluation and psychological test\u0002ing. Her mother had suspected she had high-functioning  ASD since she was 3 years old as she struggled to relate  socially to children of the same age. At the time of test\u0002ing, she demonstrated moderate to severe intellectual  disability and was diagnosed with co-morbid ASD. To objectively measure the patient\u2019s improvement while  on clozapine, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales  (VABS) (Vineland-3) Comprehensive Interview Form  was used as a reference to assess parent-reported changes  in adaptive functioning. Te VABS is a measure of adapt\u0002able behavior used to assess individuals with intellectual  and developmental disabilities by scoring the patient\u2019s  adaptive behavior abilities in the domains of communi\u0002cation, daily living, and socialization. A baseline assess\u0002ment was obtained prior to clozapine initiation, and she  was scored again 8 months into the clozapine treatment,  to track her improvements. Her VABS Composite score  ranked below the frst percentile throughout treatment,  however, she showed improvements in raw scores across  multiple subdomains, consistent with newly acquired  skills while on clozapine. Improvements in the daily living skills subdomain  included acquiring self-sufciency in areas of feeding,  dressing and hygiene, with the personal daily living  skills raw score improving from 81 to 87. Her interper\u0002sonal relationships, part of subdomain socialization,  demonstrated improvements in social appropriateness,  behavioral and emotional control, with a raw score  increase from 18 to 22. Receptive language raw score  improved from 43 to 51, and included improved ability  to follow instructions and improved attention. Written  skills raw score improved from 29 to 34, with greater  written vocabulary and word recall from memory. Her  expressive language skills remained unchanged, with  pre- and post-clozapine treatment scores at 23. Her  domestic skills raw score improved from 14 to 20, with  the patient now able to make her bed daily and prepare  simple meals for herself. Her mother reports that the patient seems to expe\u0002rience decreased frequency, intensity, and duration  of hallucinations. She is less internally distracted and  more engaged socially, wanting to participate in family  activities and able to participate in testing to return to  in-person school. She has been experiencing a broader  range of afect since the clozapine treatment, with more  frequent smiling. Her sleep and appetite have also  normalized. Te patient was monitored for clozapine side efects  and toxicity weekly for the frst 6  months and biweekly  thereafter. While on clozapine, the patient experienced  increased abdominal girth, which is a well-documented  side efect of clozapine [8]. She did not experience other  metabolic side efects. She did experience sedation dur\u0002ing initial titration, which resolved. During the initial  months of treatment, the patient exhibited tachycardia  of approximately 115 beats per minute. As the clozapine  dose was increased above 200 mg, the patient\u2019s heart rate  rose to 130 beats per minute, with associated symptom  of fatigue. Following extensive evaluation that included  EKG, echocardiogram, serum troponin and CRP moni\u0002toring, and cardiology consult, the tachycardia was attrib\u0002uted to the use of clozapine, which is a known side efect  of the atypical antipsychotic [8]. Te patient was started  on atenolol 12.5  mg daily, which resolved the tachycar\u0002dia and alleviated the associated fatigue. Te patient was  prophylactically prescribed polyethylene glycol as a stool  softener prior to the onset of clozapine titration, and had  no reported constipation during treatment. Te patient  did not experience orthostatic hypotension, myocarditis,  alterations in absolute neutrophil count or other blood  cell counts, extrapyramidal symptoms, sialorrhea, or  other side efects. Overall, the patient\u2019s side efect profle  on clozapine appears similar to those of patients without  SHINE syndrome. Yang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 4 of 5 Discussion Tis report alerts health professionals to the existence of  SHINE syndrome and the need to include it in the dif\u0002ferential diagnosis for acute psychotic symptoms in chil\u0002dren. We also call for more research on synaptopathies  to better understand and treat this disease. SHINE syn\u0002drome, also known as DLG4-related synaptopathy, is  a neurodevelopmental disorder due to dysfunction of  the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded  by  DLG4. Te prevalence of this disorder is unknown,  with only 53 patient cases in global literature reviews [4].  PSD-95 regulates excitatory synaptic function, strength,  and plasticity in the brain. It plays a key role in brain  development and function with major modulatory efects  on glutamatergic synapses. Dysfunction in these recep\u0002tors leads to altered excitatory synaptic transmission.  PSD-95 has a unique role in uncoupling dopamine-glu\u0002tamate and dampening the interaction between them.  Malfunction of this receptor may result in concomitant  overactivation of both D1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA) receptors, jeopardizing neuronal integrity and  triggering neurotoxicity. An important consequence of  the failure of this feedback loop is increased dopamine  levels in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine  pathways, leading to positive, negative and cognitive  symptoms, respectively [5, 8]. Our case study shows that SHINE syndrome may pre\u0002sent with treatment-resistant psychosis in youth. Our  patient\u2019s treatment-resistant schizophrenia second\u0002ary to SHINE syndrome is a rare presentation and is  also uniquely responsive to clozapine therapy. It should  be noted that the patient does have a family history of a  paternal grandmother with adult-onset bipolar disor\u0002der with psychotic features. However, both her parents,  including her father, as well as extended family members,  are free from psychosis and other psychiatric symptoms.  Tis suggests overall low genetic loading for typical psy\u0002chotic illness. Moreover, unlike her grandparent\u2019s illness,  the patient\u2019s psychosis was early-onset, associated with  profound regression and was initially treatment resistant.  Additionally, while psychosis is not considered a cardinal  feature of SHINE syndrome, 10% of the 53 documented  cases had reported psychosis [4]. Terefore, although an  interaction between genetic factors cannot be excluded, it  is highly likely that this child\u2019s mutation related to SHINE  syndrome is the most signifcant contributing cause of her  psychosis. We hypothesize that our patient\u2019s treatment-resistant  psychosis was related to the NMDA dysfunction second\u0002ary to SHINE syndrome, and therefore responsive to glu\u0002tamatergic modulation using clozapine. Clozapine is the  gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Prior  studies have found neurons from clozapine-responsive  patients that exhibited a reciprocal dysregulation of gene  expression, particularly related to glutamatergic and  downstream signaling, which was possibly reversed by  clozapine treatment. Clozapine treatment decreased the  intensity and distress of internal stimuli, afective lability,  aggression, social withdrawal, isolation, thought blocking,  world salad, and afect blunting in our patient. In addition,  the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale showed notable  improvements in executive function, receptive language,  daily living skills, and socialization. Understanding the  unique pathophysiological mechanisms of psychosis in  SHINE syndrome is necessary to better predict who is at  risk for treatment-resistant psychosis and when to con\u0002sider clozapine. Tis case also highlights the importance  of interdisciplinary care in pediatric patients with psy\u0002chosis by illustrating the critical role of genetic specialists  in providing specifc diagnoses which thereby facilitate  appropriate medical treatment. Currently, treatment strategies due to genetic vari\u0002ants for psychosis remain limited. Our decision to use  clozapine as a treatment for resistant schizophrenia was  aided by the knowledge of the patient\u2019s SHINE syndrome  diagnosis, due to a mutation in synapse proteins related  to glutamate. Te ability of clozapine to modulate glu\u0002tamatergic activity made it particularly suitable for this  case. Identifcation of the glutamate protein mutation  helped build our understanding of other mechanisms,  and ultimately enabled us to arrive at the treatment deci\u0002sion for clozapine for this patient. Tese results can pro\u0002vide information regarding how genetic changes afect  neural pathways and proteins, consequently furthering  research capabilities in creating unique interventions  and personalized care. Tis can help to bridge the knowl\u0002edge gap present today, leading to more tailored health  care solutions for those living with SHINE syndrome and  other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion Tis study illustrates the role of SHINE syndrome in the  diferential diagnosis for acute psychotic symptoms in  pediatric patients, and how clozapine can be used as a  treatment, especially for the positive and negative cogni\u0002tive symptoms domains of psychosis secondary to SHINE  syndrome. By describing this unique presentation of  SHINE syndrome, we hope to contribute towards appro\u0002priate clinical suspicion, to disseminate knowledge of the  existence of this condition, and to call for studies on the  possible endocrinologic efects on this disease process.  Tis report also highlights the importance of genetic  screening within the diagnosis of Early Onset Schizo\u0002phrenia.

This case describes a pediatric female who was diagnosed with early-onset  schizophrenia and catatonia in her early adolescence, and was later found to have DLG4-related synaptopathy, also  known as SHINE syndrome. SHINE syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dysfunction of the  postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded by the DLG4 gene. After failing three antipsychotic drug treat\u0002ments, the patient was started on clozapine, which resulted in signifcant improvements in positive and negative  symptoms. This case illustrates the impact of clozapine in treatment-resistant early-onset psychosis and exemplifes  practical implications for genetic testing in early-onset schizophrenia. Keywords Synaptopathy, Clozapine, Early-onset, Treatment-resistant, Schizophrenia, Psychosis, Genetic testing,  Pediatric Background Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), schizophrenia with  onset before 18 years old, Very Early Onset Schizophre\u0002nia (VEOS), schizophrenia with onset before 13  years  old, and psychotic symptoms in pediatric patients are  rare and require further workup to exclude primary psy\u0002chiatric and neurologic conditions, infectious processes,  and toxic or metabolic causes. While adult-onset schiz\u0002ophrenia has been studied in detail, research on EOS  is limited, partly due to its low prevalence and because  EOS was not recognized in the diagnostic systems before  the introduction of DSM-III in 1980. Te prevalence of  schizophrenia in children and adolescents is low, about  1.4 in 10,000 before the age of 15 [1, 2]. Te etiology of  EOS is not well understood because of the scant data on  this condition, and even less is known about the role of  genetic variations in EOS, which leads to the low inci\u0002dence of genetic testing in patient workup unless the  patient\u2019s family history includes schizophrenia [3]. One  rare genetic cause of EOS is SHINE syndrome. SHINE syndrome, also known as DLG4-related syn\u0002aptopathy, is a neurodevelopmental disorder due to dys\u0002function of the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95),  encoded by  DLG4. Te prevalence of this disorder is  unknown, with 53 patients confrmed in global literature  reviews [4]. PSD-95 regulates excitatory synaptic func\u0002tion, strength, and plasticity in the brain. It plays a key  role in brain development and function with major mod\u0002ulatory efects on glutamatergic synapses.

BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 2 of 5 these receptors alters excitatory synaptic transmission,  leading to positive, negative and cognitive symptoms.  Developmental regression is also a common symptom  amongst SHINE patients. In addition, several behavioral  issues including self-aggression, behavioral outbursts,  bipolar disorder, catatonia, and obsessive\u2013compulsive  disorder (OCD), have been described in conditions that  afect glutamatergic neuron activity [5, 6]. SHINE syndrome is an acronym for a common set  of symptoms seen in afected patients, including Sleep  disturbances, Hypotonia, Intellectual disability, Neu\u0002rological disorders, and Epilepsy [7]. Autistic features,  regression in motor and language skills, and psychosis  have been reported in less than half of cases. Psychosis  is not considered a cardinal feature of the condition. Our  understanding of the relationship between SHINE syn\u0002drome and early onset psychosis is limited, with fewer  than 10 documented cases in the literature. Case presentation An early-adolescent female with a past medical history  of learning disability diagnosed in 1st grade, presented to  the psychiatry clinic with a 7-month history of selective  mutism and depressed mood. She had an unremarkable birth history and had met  her motor milestones. She did not start speaking until  23 months, when she reportedly started speaking in age\u0002appropriate full sentences. In addition, she was reported  not to smile or interact as much as other children but  was still \u201ca happy and social child and made friends\u201d. Her  mother reported that she was diagnosed with a learning  disability in 1st grade and placed on an Individualized  Education Plan (IEP) for math and reading, but excelled  in those classes with A\u2019s and B\u2019s. At the time of the ini\u0002tial visit, she had recently started 8th grade. She enjoyed  gymnastics, tumbling, and cheerleading until October  of 2019. Menarche occurred at 13 years old, and menses  were irregular, with only 8 periods from 2019\u20132021. She  has a family history of bipolar I with psychotic features in  her paternal grandmother that responded well to quetia\u0002pine. Otherwise, family psychiatric history was negative.  She lives with her parents and 18-year-old brother and  has no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. At the initial visit, the patient softly told her parents  that \u201cTe Voice\u201d told her not to talk. She was diagnosed  with selective mutism and adjustment disorder at pres\u0002entation, started on sertraline and Cognitive Behavioral  Terapy (CBT). She continued to withdraw with ongoing  refusal to speak to family and peers. She began whisper\u0002ing to internal stimuli and displayed physical aggression  to her parents. Within a few months, she stopped par\u0002ticipating in self-care/hygiene and developed mixed cat\u0002atonia, with mutism, posturing, and agitation. She was  hospitalized and worked up for new-onset psychosis with  EEG, MRI, CT Abdomen, CT Chest, CT Pelvis, and CSF  studies with encephalitis panel, lysosomal enzyme panel,  CRP, ESR, and TPO antibody tests. All results were nor\u0002mal, and she was started on clonazepam and risperidone.  Risperidone 1  mg worsened her mutism, stereotypical  movements, and odd behaviors, and she stopped eat\u0002ing and drinking. Te risperidone was stopped while the  clonazepam continued. During this time, she minimally  interacted with others, and still responded to internal  stimuli. Tere was minimal improvement in her symp\u0002toms with clonazepam, but she was unable to tolerate  increased doses as it made her louder and more dif\u0002cult to manage. Decreasing clonazepam made her less  verbal, more withdrawn, and agitated. Oanzapine 5  mg  was added  with improvements in aggression and was  discharged with residual catatonia. However, at home  she would pace the house for hours, and frequently  tried to elope. She had a good appetite but was still fre\u0002quently responding to internal stimuli. Her catatonia  improved, and clonazepam was tapered of. Olanzapine  was increased with mild improvements in speech pro\u0002duction, and she was able to answer questions with one  to two-word responses. However, she was reported to  start throwing objects and screaming daily, particularly  at night, which interfered with her sleep. Her appetite  increased and her weight subsequently increased. She  was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia in March  2021. In June 2021, due to olanzapine\u2019s metabolic side  efects, she began metformin treatment to help with  weight gain, hyperlipidemia and elevated HgA1c. In November 2021, she started on a cross-titration  from olanzapine 7.5 mg daily to aripiprazole 20 mg daily  due to ongoing internal preoccupation and psychotic  symptoms. She also presented with signifcant side  efects of Parkinsonism and had a 30  lb weight gain on  olanzapine, limiting further titration. Although cross\u0002titration to aripiprazole helped her lose 5 lbs and normal\u0002ized her appetite, she began to have insomnia, regression  of speech, and worsening episodes of physical aggression.  In March 2022, she was restarted on olanzapine, which  stabilized her aggression but resulted in another 10  lb  weight gain. She was still responding to internal stimuli  and displayed prominent negative symptoms. She was evaluated in genetics clinic where she was  noted to be normally grown and minimally dysmor\u0002phic, with hypertelorism and a prominent nose. Her  early development history suggested that an underlying  genetic neurodevelopmental syndrome was responsible  for her psychosis. Te diferential diagnosis included  many chromosome disorders, most prominently  22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Neurometabolic disor\u0002ders other than Wilson disease, were also of concern as  Yang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 3 of 5 many are treatable. Genetic testing was ordered, includ\u0002ing a chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and  whole exome sequencing. Te CMA was normal but  the whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo muta\u0002tion in the gene DLG4, consistent with DLG4-related  synaptopathy also known as SHINE syndrome. Spe\u0002cifcally, she carries thep. (Arg660Ter) (CGA >TGA):  c. 1978 C>T in exon 19 of the DLG4 gene which is a  nonsense variant that is predicted to result in protein  truncation or decay. Tis variant has been observed de  novo without confrmed parentage in multiple unre\u0002lated patients with DLG4-related neurodevelopmental  disorder in the published literature [4]. Te patient also  carries a likely pathogenic variant in the MT-TA gene at  a 2% heteroplasmy level. Due to the low level of hetero\u0002plasmy, it is unknown whether she will exhibit symp\u0002toms of a mitochondrial disorder, although the typical  lower threshold for the presence of any mitochondrial  disease symptoms is 5% heteroplasmy. In May 2022, her parents consented to clozapine treat\u0002ment due to her treatment-refractory schizophrenia,  having trialed risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine.  Metformin was increased to 2000  mg daily, and poly\u0002ethylene glycol was started. Baseline studies for clozap\u0002ine safety monitoring were obtained. Troponin, ANC,  and CRP were within normal limits. EKG showed con\u0002cern for Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, and  after subsequent Holter monitoring for 30 days, she was  cleared by cardiology in July 2022 to begin clozapine  therapy. Because of the prevalence of autism spectrum  disorder (ASD) in SHINE syndrome, she was referred  for a formal autism evaluation and psychological test\u0002ing. Her mother had suspected she had high-functioning  ASD since she was 3 years old as she struggled to relate  socially to children of the same age. At the time of test\u0002ing, she demonstrated moderate to severe intellectual  disability and was diagnosed with co-morbid ASD. To objectively measure the patient\u2019s improvement while  on clozapine, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales  (VABS) (Vineland-3) Comprehensive Interview Form  was used as a reference to assess parent-reported changes  in adaptive functioning. Te VABS is a measure of adapt\u0002able behavior used to assess individuals with intellectual  and developmental disabilities by scoring the patient\u2019s  adaptive behavior abilities in the domains of communi\u0002cation, daily living, and socialization. A baseline assess\u0002ment was obtained prior to clozapine initiation, and she  was scored again 8 months into the clozapine treatment,  to track her improvements. Her VABS Composite score  ranked below the frst percentile throughout treatment,  however, she showed improvements in raw scores across  multiple subdomains, consistent with newly acquired  skills while on clozapine. Improvements in the daily living skills subdomain  included acquiring self-sufciency in areas of feeding,  dressing and hygiene, with the personal daily living  skills raw score improving from 81 to 87. Her interper\u0002sonal relationships, part of subdomain socialization,  demonstrated improvements in social appropriateness,  behavioral and emotional control, with a raw score  increase from 18 to 22. Receptive language raw score  improved from 43 to 51, and included improved ability  to follow instructions and improved attention. Written  skills raw score improved from 29 to 34, with greater  written vocabulary and word recall from memory. Her  expressive language skills remained unchanged, with  pre- and post-clozapine treatment scores at 23. Her  domestic skills raw score improved from 14 to 20, with  the patient now able to make her bed daily and prepare  simple meals for herself. Her mother reports that the patient seems to expe\u0002rience decreased frequency, intensity, and duration  of hallucinations. She is less internally distracted and  more engaged socially, wanting to participate in family  activities and able to participate in testing to return to  in-person school. She has been experiencing a broader  range of afect since the clozapine treatment, with more  frequent smiling. Her sleep and appetite have also  normalized. Te patient was monitored for clozapine side efects  and toxicity weekly for the frst 6  months and biweekly  thereafter. While on clozapine, the patient experienced  increased abdominal girth, which is a well-documented  side efect of clozapine [8]. She did not experience other  metabolic side efects. She did experience sedation dur\u0002ing initial titration, which resolved. During the initial  months of treatment, the patient exhibited tachycardia  of approximately 115 beats per minute. As the clozapine  dose was increased above 200 mg, the patient\u2019s heart rate  rose to 130 beats per minute, with associated symptom  of fatigue. Following extensive evaluation that included  EKG, echocardiogram, serum troponin and CRP moni\u0002toring, and cardiology consult, the tachycardia was attrib\u0002uted to the use of clozapine, which is a known side efect  of the atypical antipsychotic [8]. Te patient was started  on atenolol 12.5  mg daily, which resolved the tachycar\u0002dia and alleviated the associated fatigue. Te patient was  prophylactically prescribed polyethylene glycol as a stool  softener prior to the onset of clozapine titration, and had  no reported constipation during treatment. Te patient  did not experience orthostatic hypotension, myocarditis,  alterations in absolute neutrophil count or other blood  cell counts, extrapyramidal symptoms, sialorrhea, or  other side efects. Overall, the patient\u2019s side efect profle  on clozapine appears similar to those of patients without  SHINE syndrome. Yang et al. BMC Psychiatry (2023) 23:483 Page 4 of 5 Discussion Tis report alerts health professionals to the existence of  SHINE syndrome and the need to include it in the dif\u0002ferential diagnosis for acute psychotic symptoms in chil\u0002dren. We also call for more research on synaptopathies  to better understand and treat this disease. SHINE syn\u0002drome, also known as DLG4-related synaptopathy, is  a neurodevelopmental disorder due to dysfunction of  the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95), encoded  by  DLG4. Te prevalence of this disorder is unknown,  with only 53 patient cases in global literature reviews [4].  PSD-95 regulates excitatory synaptic function, strength,  and plasticity in the brain. It plays a key role in brain  development and function with major modulatory efects  on glutamatergic synapses. Dysfunction in these recep\u0002tors leads to altered excitatory synaptic transmission.  PSD-95 has a unique role in uncoupling dopamine-glu\u0002tamate and dampening the interaction between them.  Malfunction of this receptor may result in concomitant  overactivation of both D1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate  (NMDA) receptors, jeopardizing neuronal integrity and  triggering neurotoxicity. An important consequence of  the failure of this feedback loop is increased dopamine  levels in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine  pathways, leading to positive, negative and cognitive  symptoms, respectively [5, 8]. Our case study shows that SHINE syndrome may pre\u0002sent with treatment-resistant psychosis in youth. Our  patient\u2019s treatment-resistant schizophrenia second\u0002ary to SHINE syndrome is a rare presentation and is  also uniquely responsive to clozapine therapy. It should  be noted that the patient does have a family history of a  paternal grandmother with adult-onset bipolar disor\u0002der with psychotic features. However, both her parents,  including her father, as well as extended family members,  are free from psychosis and other psychiatric symptoms.  Tis suggests overall low genetic loading for typical psy\u0002chotic illness. Moreover, unlike her grandparent\u2019s illness,  the patient\u2019s psychosis was early-onset, associated with  profound regression and was initially treatment resistant.  Additionally, while psychosis is not considered a cardinal  feature of SHINE syndrome, 10% of the 53 documented  cases had reported psychosis [4]. Terefore, although an  interaction between genetic factors cannot be excluded, it  is highly likely that this child\u2019s mutation related to SHINE  syndrome is the most signifcant contributing cause of her  psychosis. We hypothesize that our patient\u2019s treatment-resistant  psychosis was related to the NMDA dysfunction second\u0002ary to SHINE syndrome, and therefore responsive to glu\u0002tamatergic modulation using clozapine. Clozapine is the  gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Prior  studies have found neurons from clozapine-responsive  patients that exhibited a reciprocal dysregulation of gene  expression, particularly related to glutamatergic and  downstream signaling, which was possibly reversed by  clozapine treatment. Clozapine treatment decreased the  intensity and distress of internal stimuli, afective lability,  aggression, social withdrawal, isolation, thought blocking,  world salad, and afect blunting in our patient. In addition,  the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale showed notable  improvements in executive function, receptive language,  daily living skills, and socialization. Understanding the  unique pathophysiological mechanisms of psychosis in  SHINE syndrome is necessary to better predict who is at  risk for treatment-resistant psychosis and when to con\u0002sider clozapine. Tis case also highlights the importance  of interdisciplinary care in pediatric patients with psy\u0002chosis by illustrating the critical role of genetic specialists  in providing specifc diagnoses which thereby facilitate  appropriate medical treatment. Currently, treatment strategies due to genetic vari\u0002ants for psychosis remain limited. Our decision to use  clozapine as a treatment for resistant schizophrenia was  aided by the knowledge of the patient\u2019s SHINE syndrome  diagnosis, due to a mutation in synapse proteins related  to glutamate. Te ability of clozapine to modulate glu\u0002tamatergic activity made it particularly suitable for this  case. Identifcation of the glutamate protein mutation  helped build our understanding of other mechanisms,  and ultimately enabled us to arrive at the treatment deci\u0002sion for clozapine for this patient. Tese results can pro\u0002vide information regarding how genetic changes afect  neural pathways and proteins, consequently furthering  research capabilities in creating unique interventions  and personalized care. Tis can help to bridge the knowl\u0002edge gap present today, leading to more tailored health  care solutions for those living with SHINE syndrome and  other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion Tis study illustrates the role of SHINE syndrome in the  diferential diagnosis for acute psychotic symptoms in  pediatric patients, and how clozapine can be used as a  treatment, especially for the positive and negative cogni\u0002tive symptoms domains of psychosis secondary to SHINE  syndrome. By describing this unique presentation of  SHINE syndrome, we hope to contribute towards appro\u0002priate clinical suspicion, to disseminate knowledge of the  existence of this condition, and to call for studies on the  possible endocrinologic efects on this disease process.  Tis report also highlights the importance of genetic  screening within the diagnosis of Early Onset Schizo\u0002phrenia.

He had a history of diabetes mellitus for 7 years, hypertension and chronic kidney disease for 5 years, and Bullous Pemphigoid (BP) for 2 years. Systemic glucocorti\u0002coid (oral prednisone 25 mg twice a day) was prescribed to treat his BP for more than 1 year. \u0002 Study conducted at the Department of Dermatology, The Sec\u0002ond Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China. After admission, blood test for fungal glucan was 213 pg/mL (the normal is lower than 60 pg/mL), which indicated a deep fungal infection. Blood culture for fungi was negative, and no lymphadenopathy was detected by ultrasonography. The light microscopy showed epidermal hyperplasia, dermal abscess, and infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes, epithelioid cells, and scattered multinu\u0002cleated giant cells (Fig. 2A). Intracellular hyphae were observed in multinucleated cells in the granuloma (Fig. 2B). The skin sample was also sent for Next Generation Sequenc\u0002ing (NGS) to identify the pathogen. The NGS reported Trichophyton rubrum nucleotide sequences (Cover rate: 0.0199%) in DNA extracted from the skin specimen. Consider\u0002ing the patient\u2019s clinical and histological manifestations, and the notable high sequencing reads compared to a negative control, we established the diagnosis of generalized nodular tinea profunda caused by Trichophyton rubrum. Oral ther\u0002apy with 250 mg terbinafine per day was initiated and the nodules regressed completely after 3 months. Trichophyton rubrum often causes superficial dermato\u0002mycosis, such as tinea manus, tinea pedis and tinea corporis. But in very few cases, T. rubrum penetrate into the dermis 544 Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia 2023;98(4):529---558 Figure 1 Clinical aspect: (A---C) Multiple papules and subcutaneous nodules and onychomycosis.

Although the patient\u2019s blood test was posi\u0002tive to fungal glucan, suggesting a deep fungal infection, the blood fungal culture was negative, and no lymphadenopathy was found by ultrasonography. The patient had onychomy\u0002cosis for many years and did not received any treatment (Fig. 1C).

Hidradenoma papilliferum of the vulva: a dermoscopic challenging diagnosis\u0002 Dear Editor, A 50-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic cuta\u0002neous papular lesion on the vulva (right interlabial fold) of unknown duration. Genital examination revealed a single, firm, well-circumscribed, smooth surfaced focally ulcer\u0002ated papule (4 \u00d7 4 mm) with no pigment (Fig. 1A). There was no evidence of any bleeding, breakdown, or infec\u0002tion. The inguinal lymph nodes were not enlarged on either side. Dermoscopy showed a central reddish ulceration with undermined edges due to the detachment of the mucosal surface from the lower layers surrounded by a whitish halo in the absence of other dermoscopically-relevant parame\u0002ters (Fig. 1B). There was a non-specific vascular pattern with tiny linear vessels on a reddish and whitish background. The clinical and dermoscopic features did not suggest any diag\u0002nosis. If the dermoscopic aspect could be used to exclude a melanocytic lesion, even an achromic one, then a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma --- a very frequent tumor in this particular anatomical site --- could not be excluded. An exci\u0002sional biopsy was performed followed by a histopathological examination. Microscopically, a dermal cystic adnexal tumor composed of numerous papillary projections lined by a \u0002 Study conducted at the Dermatological Clinic of the University of Florence, Florence, Italy. peripheral layer of myoepithelial cells and a luminal layer of tall columnar cells showing decapitation secretion (Fig. 2) was observed; thus, a final diagnosis of hidradenoma papil\u0002liferum (HP) was made. The patient received no further therapy and had an uneventful clinical course during a 10-year follow-up. Dur\u0002ing this period, the patient underwent a shave biopsy of another mucosal lesion on the labia minora of the vulva, and the histopathological examination revealed a fibroep\u0002ithelial polyp with associated mild viral-related changes on the overlying epithelium. HP is a benign adnexal neoplasm that develops almost exclusively in women with a wide age range preferentially in the labium majus of the vulva. Although HP was previously thought to have an apocrine origin, recent studies have sug\u0002gested that it may derive from the anogenital mammary-like glands.1 It usually presents clinically as an asymptomatic, slow-growing, well-circumscribed, flesh-colored to red nod\u0002ule typically located in the vulval interlabial sulcus or labium majus. The term \u2018\u2018ectopic\u2019\u2019 HP has been reported to describe cases occurring in the head and neck as well as the breast, axilla, external ear canal, and eyelid. HP may have a heterogeneous clinical appearance and can mimic other vulval neoplasms; thus, the final diagnosis needs to be confirmed histologically. Although HP has been histologically well characterized, to the best of our knowledge, the dermoscopic features of vulval HP have only been reported by Tosti et al.2 They reported that most polymorphous dermoscopic findings do not lead to a definitive diagnosis.

Corresponding author: Ying Gao, MM E-mail: gying0429@163.com  BACKGROUND Ginkgo biloba extract is commonly used in  ophthalmology to enhance ocular blood flow and address  neurological disorders, particularly in treating optic nerve  diseases. However, its utilization is not without risks, as it has  been associated with a relatively high incidence of adverse  drug reactions. According to previous studies, the reported  incidence of adverse reactions to Ginkgo biloba extract can  reach as high as 9.36%.1  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are  defined as harmful reactions that occur as a result of the  normal usage and dosage of qualified drugs but are unrelated  to the drug\u2019s intended purpose.2  Severe ADRs encompass  reactions that lead to death, pose life-threatening risks, or  cause significant damage to organ function. Examples include  anaphylactic shock, a clinically critical condition that can be  fatal. However, ophthalmologists often have limited exposure  to severe rescue situations in clinical practice. They may lack  familiarity with relevant knowledge and have relatively weak  proficiency in managing severe ADRs.3  This knowledge gap  poses significant medical safety risks when identifying and  addressing severe ADRs. This paper presents a case report and examines previous  literature to summarize the clinical characteristics, diagnosis,  and treatment strategies for ADRs associated with injection\u0002based therapies. Furthermore, it discusses key preventive  measures to enhance drug administration\u2019s safety in  ophthalmology.4,5 ABSTRACT Background \u2022 Ginkgo biloba extract preparations are  commonly used in ophthalmology to improve circulatory  disorders and provide neurotrophic support for the treatment  of optic neuropathy. However, their use also carries a higher  risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), some of which can be  severe and even life-threatening, such as anaphylactic shock.  This case report highlights the importance of recognizing  and managing ADRs associated with ginkgo biloba extract  in ophthalmology clinical practice. This report aims to  emphasize the need for appropriate patient selection,  adherence to prescribing guidelines, and proactive measures  to reduce ADR occurrence. Case Presentation \u2022 We present the case of a patient who  experienced a severe ADR following the administration of  Ginkgo biloba and Damo injection. The patient, a middle\u0002aged individual without a history of allergies, developed  anaphylactic shock within 30 minutes of medication  initiation. Prompt medical intervention, including  medication withdrawal, resuscitation, and intensive care  unit transfer, led to symptom relief and successful recovery. Conclusions \u2022 This case underscores the need for vigilance  when prescribing ginkgo biloba extract, particularly in  middle-aged and elderly patients. Despite no previous  history of allergies and adherence to the prescribed  dosage, severe ADR can still occur. Close monitoring of  patients within the first 30 minutes of medication  administration is crucial. Furthermore, strict adherence  to drug instructions, proper TCM syndrome  differentiation, appropriate choice of infusion solvents,  and strict control of drip rates should be considered to  enhance patient safety. Other factors such as patient age,  allergy history, and initial medication were also identified  as important considerations in preventing ADRs. This  case report emphasizes the significance of early  identification, immediate withdrawal of medication, vital  sign monitoring, and timely administration of anti\u0002allergy drugs in managing ADR.

He presented with sudden blindness and  symptoms of qi deficiency and blood stasis. The patient  reported experiencing mental sleep, loose stools, and normal  urine. He had a history of diabetes for the past 4 months but  did not adhere to regular medication. There was no history of  other chronic diseases, drug allergies, or food allergies.  Additionally, the patient had a 20-year history of alcohol  consumption at a rate of half a catty per day. Ocular Examination  Upon admission, the visual acuity of both eyes was  measured as index/30cm, with no improvement upon  correction. The intraocular pressure was recorded as  15mmHg in the right eye and 14mmHg in the left eye. There  were no apparent restrictions in binocular eye movement,  and the ocular position was positive. The conjunctiva of both  eyes showed no signs of congestion, and the cornea was  transparent. No keratic precipitates (KP) were observed, and  the depth of the anterior chamber was approximately 1CT in  the peripheral region. No signs of Tyndall effect Tyn (-) or  cells (-) were detected. Both pupils were bilateral, round with  a diameter of 5mm, and they exhibited direct light reflex.  Mild lens opacity was observed in the pupil area, along with  mild vitreous opacity. Fundus Examination Upon fundus examination, the color of the optic discs in  both eyes appeared pale and clear, with a cup-to-disc (C/D)  ratio of 0.5. The proportion of retinal vascular walking was  roughly normal, with an arterial-to-venous (A/V) ratio of  2/3. The macular fovea was not clearly visible. Clinical Examination The patient\u2019s body temperature was recorded as 36\u00b0C,  heart rate as 76 beats per minute, respiratory rate as 18  breaths per minute, and blood pressure as 126/78mmHg. No  significant cardiopulmonary abnormalities were detected.  The tongue appeared dark red with tooth marks, and there  was a thin white coating and fine veins. Treatment Protocol After stabilizing the patient\u2019s blood sugar levels,  traditional Chinese medicine (prescribed in the outpatient  setting) was continued, and acupuncture treatment was  administered. The patient received a static infusion of 70mg  ginkgo leaf extract injection in 0.9% sodium chloride solution  (250 ml) once daily, at a drip rate of approximately 60 drops  per minute. Development of Anaphylactic Shock On the sixth day, the patient experienced symptoms of  palpitations, chest tightness, lip cyanosis, cold sensation, and  generalized skin flushing, which were indicative of  anaphylactic shock. Treatment Response  The medication was immediately discontinued. The  patient\u2019s body temperature was recorded as 36\u00b0C, heart rate  as 161 beats per minute, blood pressure as 66/37mmHg,  blood glucose as 4.6 mmol/L, and the electrocardiogram  showed no obvious abnormalities. Following urgent  consultation with the cardiology and critical care departments,  double venous access was established, and a full-speed static  expansion of 1000 ml of sodium chloride injection was  administered. The patient received a static dose of 10mg of  dexamethasone, a 0.3 g muscle injection of adrenaline for an  anti-allergic effect, and a static dose of 2 g of calcium  gluconate. A dopamine pump was initiated to stabilise  circulation, and the patient was provided with oxygen.  Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the intensive  care unit (ICU) for further treatment. The patient\u2019s symptoms  were relieved, and their vital signs recovered smoothly. Even  in the absence of a history of allergies and with no  abnormalities observed after several days of continuous  medication, vigilance should not be relaxed, and continued  monitoring of medication should be ensured. DISCUSSION The patient exhibited typical symptoms of anaphylactic  shock, including chest tightness, cyanosis, skin flushing,  increased heart rate, and sudden changes in blood pressure.5 The primary diagnosis was ischemic optic neuropathy,  which aligned with the indications for the drug administered.  The patient had no history of drug or food allergies, and  there were no contraindications for the medication.6  The  prescribed dosage of 70mg/day and a drip rate of 60 drops  per minute were within the recommended usage and dosage.  The medication was reviewed, and confirmed that it was a  qualified drug within its shelf life. It suggests that anaphylactic  shock is a severe adverse drug reaction that poses a life\u0002threatening risk and is unrelated to the drug\u2019s intended  purpose and normal dosage.7 ADR should be differentiated from the effects of  concomitant medication, disease progression, and other  treatments.8  In this case, the patient did not receive any other  injectable medications, and there was a history of using oral  hypoglycemic drugs for many years without any previous  adverse reactions.9  The patient\u2019s ischemic optic neuropathy  does not directly affect blood pressure or heart rate, and no  cardiovascular diseases were detected in previous or  admission physical examinations. Therefore, it can be  concluded that the severe ADR observed, in this case, is  attributable to the injection of ginkgo biloba extract.10 Ginkgo biloba leaf contains over 160 components,  including flavonoids, phenols, terpenoids, trace elements,  and various amino acids.11 These components have the  potential to delay or prevent the apoptosis of retinal ganglion  cells by improving impaired nerve microcirculation,  This article is protected by copyright.

This omission  poses a hidden risk to the safe and rational use of drugs.  Secondly, the choice of intravenous infusion solvent is  inappropriate. According to the instructions for Shuxuening  injection, a 5% glucose injection should be used as the  diluent. When sodium chloride injection containing ionic  components is used, it can lead to the formation of insoluble  particles due to salt precipitation, thereby increasing the risk  of ADRs. Studies have shown that the incidence of ADRs was  2.62% with 5% glucose and 5.60% with 0.9% sodium  chloride, which was statistically significant (P<.05).19 Improper selection of sodium chloride as the diluent  was observed in 35% of previous cases. Thirdly, the  intravenous drip rate is excessively fast.20 The injection  manual for ginkgo biloba extract recommends a drip rate of  15-30 drops per minute for adults. Drip rates that are too fast  can result in the rapid infusion of a large amount of  medication into the vein, increasing the likelihood of ADRs.  In this case, and 80% of cases in the previous literature, the  drip rate exceeded 40 drops per minute. These three factors  highlight the importance of adhering to the principles of  syndrome differentiation, selecting the appropriate diluent,  and strictly controlling the drip speed. The key aspects of managing ADR include early  identification, immediate discontinuation of the medication,  monitoring of vital signs, and providing symptomatic  treatment. Prompt administration of anti-allergy drugs and  necessary life support measures is crucial. Consulting a  physician for diagnosis and treatment assistance is essential  in critical situations. In this particular case, the patient\u2019s  condition was critical.21-22 Fortunately, the onset occurred  during regular working hours when the ward director  conducted rounds. Thanks to the coordinated efforts of  doctors and nursing staff at all levels, the patient was  successfully stabilized, and no serious adverse consequences  occurred. CONCLUSION As a Chinese patent medicine preparation, the high  incidence of ADRs, particularly severe ADRs, associated with  ginkgo biloba extract poses significant safety risks in  ophthalmology clinical treatment. When prescribing Ginkgo  biloba and Damo injections, it is essential to carefully select  the appropriate patient population based on their functional  indications. Medical advice should be provided in accordance  with the instructions, and the pharmacy department should  effectively communicate drug usage information and  precautions to clinical practitioners. It is crucial to strengthen  the review process of medical advice and actively collect and  scavenging free radicals, and providing neurotrophic  support. However, due to the complexity of its components  and the multitude of targets, ginkgo biloba extract is more  likely to induce ADRs during clinical applications. One  study reported an incidence of ADRs with ginkgo biloba  extract at 9.36%, with severe ADRs accounting for  approximately 18%.12 By conducting a comprehensive search and analysis of  previous literature on Ginkgo biloba extract from databases  such as Wanfang, CNKI, and Wip from 1996 to the present,13 the following clinical features of ADRs caused by ginkgo  biloba extract have been identified: (1) Predominantly  affects middle-aged and elderly patients, with 70% of patients  being over 50 years old; (2) 87% of the patients have no  history of allergies; (3) ADRs mainly occur within 30  minutes of administration, with the earliest onset observed  between 1 to 2 minutes, and the latest after more than 10  days of continuous medication; (4) ADRs may involve  multiple organs or systems of the body, with the circulatory  system being the most commonly affected (20.62%), followed  by general malaise, and skin damage.14 Other systems that  may be affected include facial features, the nervous,  respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. In the case of this patient, who was over 50 years old and  had no history of allergies, the ADR occurred on the 6th day  of medication. This highlights the importance of closely  monitoring the medication response in middle-aged and  elderly patients within 30 minutes.15 Even in the absence of a  history of allergy and no abnormalities observed after  several days of continuous medication, vigilance should not  be relaxed, and continued monitoring of medication is  necessary.16 It has been suggested that allergic reactions caused by  Ginkgo biloba injection are primarily attributed to the  presence of impurities, such as tannins, that are not  adequately removed during the extraction process. Once  injected into the body, these impurities can form larger  molecular complexes by binding to plasma proteins, leading  to allergic reactions. Additionally, the patient\u2019s allergic  constitution and the intensity, concentration, and infusion  rate of the drug can also contribute to such reactions.  Previous literature analysis has identified common factors  contributing to ADRs: the absence of syndrome differentiation  and treatment records. Ginkgo biloba leaves possess a taste  that is sweet, bitter, and flat, and they belong to the heart and  lung meridians. They are known to promote blood  circulation, relieve pain, and are suitable for conditions such  as wind-phlegm flow in the meridians and blood stasis or  obstruction. These conditions should be accompanied by  evidence of damp stasis.17 In the present case, the patient had a long history of  alcohol consumption, which can lead to dampness and heat  accumulation in the body, damaging the spleen and stomach  and resulting in spleen deficiency. It can hinder the  promotion of essence, qi, and blood to the eyes, leading to  unknown divine light. The patient\u2019s tongue exhibited  This article is protected by copyright.

Abstract  The Monkeypox (mpox) virus outbreak has been controlled worldwide. We report the case  of a combined pancreas-kidney transplant recipient who presented a severe and prolonged  cutaneous infection with onset of 3 successive rashes while receiving tecovirimat therapy.  During follow-up, skin lesions, blood and throat samples were collected. Viral culture and  mpox PCR were performed. No positive viral culture was obtained from blood and throat.  The lowest mpox CT-values were obtained early after onset of skin lesions and were more  likely to be associated with positive viral cultures. Furthermore, we observed persistent skin  lesions up to 3 months. On these persistent lesions, mpox PCR positives were obtained but  were not associated with positive viral culture after 23 days. In this immunocompromised  host, who was receiving tecovirimat, in accordance with existing recommendations a 21-day  isolation period appeared to be adapted. That said, isolation should not be systematically  extended if complete healing of skin lesions has not been achieved.  Introduction  Monkeypox (mpox) is an orthopoxvirus belonging to the same genus as variola and was  first isolated in Denmark in 1950s [1]. Since the cessation of smallpox vaccination programs in  the 1980s, most mpox cases have occurred in Africa [2]. Between May and October 2022, an  mpox outbreak spread worldwide, especially in the men who have sex with men (MSM)  community, but was rapidly controlled thereafter. In January 2023, the Center for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 85,469 cases and 90 attributable deaths worldwide  [3,4].  Inter-human transmission has been described by direct contact with skin lesions [4] and is  considered possible until complete healing of skin lesion is obtained. A typical cutaneous rash  begins as macules and progresses to vesicles and then to crusts, which dry out and fall off.  These lesions develop in a single rash and evolve simultaneously until complete healing.  Respiratory transmission is also considered possible. However, clinical presentation of mpox  in immunocompromised patients may differ, impeding diagnosis and care [5].  Notwithstanding the availability of antiviral treatments such as tecovirimat, reports of clinical  use in immunocompromised patients are lacking [6]. As an inhibitor of the VP 37 protein  activity [7], Tecovirimat is available in France under temporary authorization for use (TAU).  Clinical response and outcome to this treatment remain poorly described, or restricted to  patients living with HIV [6]. Here we report for the first time the clinical presentation,  outcome, and complete viral load follow-up of skin lesions using viral culture and specific  quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a combined pancreas-kidney transplant  recipient who presented an extensive skin mpox infection, treated with Tecovirimat. Clinical presentation A 58-year-old man with a history of combined kidney-pancreas transplantation in 1998  was admitted in August 2022 for severe cutaneous mpox infection. His immunosuppressive  maintenance regimen included prednisone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil with no  impairment of allograft function and no recent history of acute rejection. He had received a  smallpox vaccination in 1965. He had had unprotected sex with other men 14 days before  onset of first symptoms (Day 0), corresponding to a first rash with palmoplantar and oral, anal,  genital mucosa lesions. Twelve days later, the patient was admitted to the infectious disease  unit for fever and with more than 150 lesions. Vesicles of the left nipple and scalp had merged  and presented a necrotic aspect (Figure 1A and 1C). After removal of a nipple piercing, a  \u201cKoebner-like\u201d phenomenon (onset of mpox lesion specifically on scars) appeared with mpox  lesions at the orifice (Figure 1B). Laboratory tests showed elevated leukocytes at 12.4 G/L, C\u0002Reactive Protein at 13.0 mg/dL, and cholestasis. The patient received an oral antiviral  treatment with Tecovirimat immediately upon arrival (Day 12 from first rash onset). Since the  first lesions began to heal (1st rash, Figure 1D,*), we noticed the onset of a new lesions on  previously normal skin on Day 17 (2nd rash, Figure 1D, **) and Day 19 (3rd rash, Figure 1D,***),  respectively 5 and 7 days after Tecovirimat initiation (Figure 1D, 1E). Figure 1D). No adverse  effect was reported during the 14 days of treatment. The clinical status of the patient  promptly improved and last lesions were completely healed 4 months after onset. After 6- month follow-up, no relapse or new symptom onset was reported.  Virological follow-up We chose two lesions of each successive rash (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and swabbed them at different  time points (Figure 1E, 1F and supplementary Figure). Blood samples and pharyngeal swabs  were simultaneously collected at each time with skin lesions. Two lesions of the first rash to  appear (left nipple and abdomen) were swabbed upon admission of the patient to the unit,  just before the first administration of Tecovirimat (Day 12) and then at Days 17, 19, 23, 28, 42  and 56). For the second and third rash, two lesions (respectively, right hand index/right knee  and (right thigh/right foot), were collected on the day of lesion appearance and subsequently  on Days 23, 28 and 42.  Initial diagnosis was performed using the Real-Star Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics,  Hamburg, Germany). Virological follow-up combining PCR and viral culture on clinical samples  was performed at the French Reference Center for Orthopoxvirus, in a BSL-3 laboratory. The  in-house Monkeypox PCR assay targeting the G2R gene was previously described [8]. For viral  culture, clinical samples were inoculated onto Vero E6 and HaCaT cell lines, and cytopathic  effect (CPE) appearance was observed with an inverted light microscope. Results The PCR Cycle threshold (Ct) value of the two lesions from first rash sampled just before first  administration of Tecovirimat (Day 12) was 14.54/18.00 (Figure 1E). The Ct-values of the 2nd and third rash lesions were 17.7/19.25 and 21.1/18.3 respectively on days of appearance (Day  17 and Day 19). At the end of treatment, the viral load of all rash lesions had decreased (1st rash Ct: 18.3/30.7, 2nd rash Ct: 30.9/27, 3rd rash Ct: 30.1/22.8 (Figure 1E). The viral cultures  were positive for lesions of the 1st rash from day 12 until day 23(Figure 1G). No positive viral  culture was observed after day 23 (Day 28, 42). ). For the 2nd and 3rd rash, positive viral cultures  were observed only on day of onset and not on the following days (23, 28 and 42). At Day 56,  no sample from 2nd and 3rd rash was collected since the lesions were completely healed. The  left nipple lesion from 1st rash was the only one to persist at day 56 (Figure 1E, 1F, 1G), but no  positive viral culture was observed (Figure 1E). Finally, although low Ct-values were observed  in blood and throat samples, no positive viral culture was obtained after day 12 (Figure 1E).  Complete healing of the nipple lesion was obtained after 3 months.  Discussion The following characteristics observed in our immunocompromised host infected with mpox  should be pointed out: a) The common presentation of cutaneous mpox infection is described as a single rash  with similar-aged lesion. Our patient developed 3 successive rashes over 19 days  (Figure 1D) as previously reported [9], which led to the coexistence of different-aged  lesions, as described in varicella. b) The first rash was the most extensive, and positive viral cultures were obtained from  skin samples of the 1st rash up until 23 days after onset. Complete healing of the lesion  was achieved after 3 months. c) We observed the onset of a 2nd and 3rd rash even though patient had already received  tecovirimat. Positive viral cultures were obtained from these new lesions on the day  of onset but not in the following samples, a finding suggesting reduced viral  replications. However, these observations drew no distinction between Tecovirimat  effects and the natural history of the disease. d) Paran et al [10] demonstrated that a low viral load assessed by a PCR Ct-value greater  than 35 was predictive of non-infectivity (black line in Figure 1E and 1G). Several  publications have likewise shown that Ct-values below 26 were more likely associated  with positive viral culture [11,12]. In our case, the same trends were observed, and  positive viral cultures were more likely obtained from samples with Ct-values below  19,45 (dotted line in Figures 1E, 1G). Moreover, Ct-values above 19.45 were  significantly associated with negative viral culture (Supplementary Figure 1B, 1C with  Sensitivity 87%, Specificity 92.31%). However, these data were obtained from only one  patient and are not sufficient to propose a Ct-value threshold for positive viral culture.  Taken together, positive mpox PCR and Ct values should be interpreted carefully since  no threshold is currently available to conclusively determine the presence of live virus  in a lesion or the infectiousness of the disease. That said, positive mpox PCR alone  should not lead to an extended isolation period, especially after 21 days of symptoms.  These data suggest that viral replication of the mpox may be maximal on the day of  onset of lesions and decreases over time to become negative after 21 days and before  complete healing of the lesion. In addition to the rapid implementation of a  nationwide vaccination program against mpox, these data may help to explain the  rapid control of the outbreak. Here, the patient was vaccinated against smallpox in  1965, before renal transplantation, but we did not assess the persistence of any  specific immunity and its possible implication. e) Oral transmission of mpox virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms. All  collected pharyngeal samples showed high Ct-value and negative viral cultures.  However, we did not collect any sample before Day 12, since the patient was not  admitted immediately following onset of the first symptoms.  f) Tecovirimat\u2019s efficacy for smallpox treatment has been established. The CDC  recommends consideration of antiviral therapy for mpox in individuals at high risk of  severe disease [13]. Two cases have been reported in the literature [9,14]. Onset of a  second and third rash appears to be the natural history of the disease in  immunocompromised hosts [9] and should therefore not be considered as a sign of  treatment failure.  Conclusion As reported here, several successive rashes may be observed in cases of mpox disease in an  immunocompromised patient. In persistent skin lesion, positive viral cultures were  significantly associated only with PCR Ct-values under 19.45. Since complete clinical healing  of skin lesion was achieved in our case after 3 months, no positive viral culture was obtained  after 23 days of evolution of the skin lesions. French recommendations for mpox-infected  patients are 21 days of isolation after onset of symptoms with complete healing of the lesions.  It is also recommended to extend the isolation period in case of persisting lesions until  complete healing is obtained. These data highlight the need to differentiate persistent skin  lesions from virologically active lesions. Indeed, our results are in accordance with a 21-day  isolation period, and its extension in the presence of persisting lesion is not likely to be  required.", "tokens": [{"text": "France", "start":

E-mail: guido.lewik@chch.ox.ac.uk DEAR EDITOR, Paraneoplastic (poly-)arthritis (PA) is a rarely reported side effect of the antitumour immune response, pre\u0002ceding cancer manifestation by a mean of 10.7 months [1]. Diagnosed ex juvantibus, if at all, and with <150 cases reported worldwide showing a marked heterogeneity in clini\u0002cal presentation and underlying tumour entities, timely recog\u0002nition is extremely complicated. Nevertheless, signs such as rapid onset and resistance to therapy should raise suspicion, and correct identification could expedite cancer diagnosis and treatment. Here, we present the case of a woman who, after 20 months of treatment for RA with little effect, experienced full symptom resolution upon diagnosis and removal of a Fallopian tube carcinoma. A 63-year-old, non-smoking, lean Caucasian woman with an active lifestyle presented for a rheumatology consultation with new onset of morning stiffness and painful joint swelling, predominately affecting her hands, which hindered her from pursuing leisure sports and everyday activities. Past medical history and medication merely revealed valsartan-treated arterial hypertension. Physical examination showed swollen, warm and painful MCP and basal thumb joints of both hands. Her further clinical impression was unremarkable. Blood tests returned posi\u0002tive results for RF (29.6 U/ml), CCP (46.0 U/ml) and ANA (1:320), while the inflammatory markers ESR and CRP were normal. Initially fulfilling diagnostic criteria for RA and with symptoms refractory to early treatment with etoricoxib, she was started on MTX and received complementary prednisolone. Only marginal reduction in symptoms led to MTX up-titration over time, until elevated liver enzymes prompted a switch to LEF at \u00021 year of treatment (Fig. 1). Repeated X-ray imaging showed no signs of joint destruction, and DXA indicated normal bone density. The markers of inflammation ESR and CRP also remained at normal levels despite high arthritis disease activity. After several more months of therapy with LEF and intermittent prednisolone, which yielded unsatisfactory results, her treatment was escalated to TNF blockade with etanercept (Fig. 1). After a few weeks with remaining, albeit alleviated, complaints of arthritis using this regi\u0002men, a delayed routine gynaecological US examination revealed an irregular mass in her lower abdomen. Immunosuppressive medication was stopped owing to suspected malignancy, and timely pelvic MRI substantiated the impression of a tumour. The patient was admitted to a specialized gynaecological cancer centre and underwent lap\u0002aroscopy, with bilateral adnexectomy and partial removal of omentum majus and peritoneum. Pathohistological analysis revealed a high-grade serous papillary adenocarcinoma origi\u0002nating from the right Fallopian tube, with disseminated omen\u0002tal and peritoneal metastases. Notably, symptoms of arthritis vanished completely upon laparoscopic tumour debulking. Subsequent laparotomy achieved optimal cytoreductive surgery with no residual disease, resulting in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIc (TNM classifi\u0002cation: pT3c pN1b(2/4) L1 V0 Pn0 M0). After postoperative recovery, the patient was started on ad\u0002juvant chemotherapy with six cycles of carboplatin and pacli\u0002taxel every 3 weeks, and addition of bevacizumab every 3 weeks for 15 months as per interdisciplinary tumour board recommendation (Fig. 1). She has now been off immunosup\u0002pressive medication for almost 6 months, and no symptoms of arthritis have re-emerged despite a return to prior daily activi\u0002ties and moderate exercise. Many features of this case are in line with prior PA litera\u0002ture, namely occurrence as symmetrical polyarthritis in a pa\u0002tient >50 years of age showing poor response to standard therapy with NSAIDs, glucocorticoids and DMARDs, yet Key message \u2022 Atypical arthritis warrants consideration of underlying malignancies and advising regular gynaecological check-ups, especially before anti-TNF therapy.

However, PA patients are usually male and seronega\u0002tive for RF and CCP, which are detectable in only 23% and 11%, respectively [2, 5]. Importantly, PA relief upon tumour removal in this patient was sustained without medication over 6 weeks between debulking and chemotherapy commencement, thereby far ex\u0002ceeding any prior arthritis-free interval and prompting reclas\u0002sification from RA to (rheumatoid-like) PA. Continued absence to date confirms its paraneoplastic aetiology, disput\u0002ing symptom fluctuations or intermittently reduced physical activity as confounders. Notably, PA has most often been found in lung adenocarci\u0002noma and haematological malignancies [2], and the literature yields only two prior reports of adnexal tumour association: one ovarian teratoma in a 34-year-old woman [6] and one ovarian cystadenocarcinoma in a 64-year-old woman, who, however, had an additional malignant sarcomatoid lung tumour [7]. This case report thus describes, for the first time, rheumatoid-like PA in a patient with Fallopian tube cancer. Towards improved patient care, this addition to the sparse data on PA is relevant for two main reasons. Firstly, increased awareness of PA could address the anticipated problem of underreporting, considering its solely retrospective diagnosis, the fact that advanced cancer will not always respond to treat\u0002ment well enough for PA reversion and that concomitant cir\u0002cumstances might overshadow the follow-up of co-morbidities. Indeed, a multicentre study from France indicated that, al\u0002though PA is considered rare, it made up 2.6% of admitted early arthritis patients [8]. Secondly, awareness of PA could aid patients with atypical rheumatological presentation by a mere emphatic reminder to adhere to regular routine checks, such as gynaecological examinations, offering a low-/no-cost opportu\u0002nity to find and treat malignancies sooner.

There are limited data available on this approach, and concerns remain about the possible risk of adverse events, particularly infection. Methods: We present three patients on dual biologics for rheumatic disease and asthma. The biologic combinations used were etanercept and mepolizumab, infliximab and omalizumab, and etanercept and omalizumab. The time on combination biologic therapies ranged from 24 to 36 months. Patients were monitored for any serious adverse events. Results: All three patients were able to tolerate combined biologic therapies, with no serious adverse events. All three patients gained improve\u0002ment in their rheumatic and asthma disease control, with reduction in disease activity scores and reduction in steroid usage. Conclusion: The decision to start dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis. The number of patients who are on combination biological therapy is small, and data are sparse. Real-world data are needed to examine the long-term benefits and risks of differ\u0002ent forms of combination biologic therapies. Lay Summary What does this mean for patients? Biological therapies are specific therapies that target particular parts of the immune system. These medications are used in the treatment of au\u0002toimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In RA, they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating the im\u0002mune system to attack joints. They are very effective medications to treat inflammatory autoimmune conditions. In some cases, they can be as\u0002sociated with side effects, particularly increased risk of infections. We have written a case series about three people who have inflammatory autoimmune conditions and are receiving two biologics to treat these. All three people have inflammatory arthritis and asthma and are receiving two different biological therapies. They have been receiving these for a period ranging from 24 to 36 months. All three people have been able to tolerate combined biologic therapies, with no serious adverse events thus far. They have gained improvement in their arthritis and asthma con\u0002trol, with reduction in disease activity and the use of steroids. Although the number of people receiving more than one biological treatment is small, this study suggests that dual therapy could be used in certain situations. The decision to start dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis, by the specialists.

There are limited data available regarding this, and concerns remain about the risk of adverse events, particularly infections, in ad\u0002dition to potential drug interactions in patients receiving more than one biological therapy [1]. We present a case series of three patients who have benefited from dual biologic therapy for rheumatic disease and asthma. Key messages \u2022 Combination biological therapies are being considered increasingly for patients who present with multiple co-morbidities. \u2022 Data presented here suggest that combination biologics can be used safely, without serious adverse events. \u2022 The decision to start dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis.

Rheumatology Advances in Practice, 2023, 7(1), rkad018 https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkad018 Advance access publication 3 February 2023 Concise Report Rheumatology Advances in Practice Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/7/1/rkad018/7025501 by guest on 19 July 2023 Literature on dual biologic therapy is limited, owing to the infrequency of this clinical approach. There are significant clinical reservations in taking this approach owing to the po\u0002tential risk of serious infection from immunosuppression [1]. In addition, the wide variety of biological therapies and their potential combinations makes consistent comparison of out\u0002comes difficult, and structured clinical trials are infrequent. Development of newer agents targeting different pathways has made it possible to use combination therapy in selected patients. Simultaneous use of more than one biological agent has been used in two main scenarios: patients with severe in\u0002flammatory disease unresponsive to a single biological agent, or patients with co-existing severe medical conditions, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease [2\u20134], asthma [5, 6] and psoria\u0002sis [7]. There is limited real world evidence from case-based literature on combining biological therapies across different clinical specialties. Methods We present three cases illustrating the outcome of combina\u0002tion therapy for severe asthma and inflammatory arthritis. Formal ethics approval was not required for this work be\u0002cause only anonymized patient information was included and no change to patients\u2019 standard care was required in order to be included in the case series. All patients gave written in\u0002formed consent to the use of their data. A summary of the clinical presentations and therapies can be found in Table 1. Etanercept and infliximab are anti-TNF-a agents licensed for the treatment of moderate or severe RA [8]. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE biologic used for the treatment of atopic asthma [9]. Mepolizumab is an anti-IL-5 agent used for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. We have defined serious adverse events in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration definition [10]. A seri\u0002ous adverse event is an undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product, which is life threatening, can re\u0002sult in death, hospitalization, disability, permanent damage or congenital anomaly. This also includes other serious events, such as allergic bronchospasm, serious blood dyscrasias or seizures. We have also included transaminitis and infections requiring antibiotics. Information was gathered by reviewing medical notes at the tertiary centre, the local hospital, from general practitioner records and by contacting patients. Case one Case one is a 56-year-old woman with severe eosinophilic asthma diagnosed in the late 1990s and seronegative RA diag\u0002nosed in 2019. Her asthma was previously treated with bronchodilator and steroid inhalers, montelukast and daily maintenance prednisolone. Mepolizumab was commenced in 2018, and since then she has reported no exacerbations of her asthma. Mid-2022, she was reviewed by the asthma service and was tolerating mepolizumab well, was no longer on mon\u0002telukast or the steroid inhaler, and had not had to use her sal\u0002butamol inhaler for \u00027 months. For RA, she was initially treated with sulphasalazine (SSZ), but this was not tolerated and was stopped. She commenced methotrexate (MTX) 20 mg s.c. once weekly along with pred\u0002nisolone in early 2020, but after 6 months remained symp\u0002tomatic, with evidence of active synovitis on musculoskeletal ultrasound (US), despite being on prednisolone 25 mg daily. At this time, her disease activity score (DAS28) was 6.25. Etanercept was then commenced alongside MTX and pred\u0002nisolone. Twenty-four months after commencing etanercept, she continues etanercept and has reduced her prednisolone to 11 mg daily. Her DAS is 2.27. It has been difficult to reduce her prednisolone further thus far owing to ongoing joint pain, although there is no synovitis on US. She is being encouraged to reduce the corticosteroids (CS) dose gradually. She has been on dual therapy for 24 months and has not had any recorded serious adverse events. Case two Case two is a 35-year-old man, known to have asthma since childhood, requiring multiple hospital admissions and an in\u0002tensive care unit admission in 2002. He has previously been on a combination of inhalers, aminophylline and montelu\u0002kast, but still required frequent courses of oral CSs. He was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease in 2006 and was subsequently diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s-associated arthritis, for which he has been on azathioprine (AZA) and infliximab since 2008. In April 2019 he was started on omalizumab for severe asthma that was difficult to control. On follow-up, he reported signif\u0002icant improvement in asthma symptoms, with no further need for oral CSs, and he no longer requires nebulized therapy. He continues infliximab at the same dose and omalizumab and has achieved good control of his Crohn\u2019s disease and associ\u0002ated arthritis. He has not experienced any serious adverse effects after 36 months of combination therapy. Case three Case three is a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with atopic eosinophilic adult-onset asthma in the late 1980s and seropositive RA in 2012. Prior therapy for asthma included a combination of bronchodilator and steroid inhalers. She was referred to the severe asthma service in 2018, and Table 1.

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/7/1/rkad018/7025501 by guest on 19 July 2023 omalizumab was commenced in June 2019. Since starting this, her asthma has been well controlled, supported by clini\u0002cal examination and ACQ-6 score (asthma control question\u0002naire). Initially, her RA was treated with MTX and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). However, despite this combina\u0002tion she had evidence of ongoing joint inflammation, and in 2018 she was started on etanercept. She has continued both biologics for 36 months with good control of asthma and RA, without any serious adverse events, and has not required any steroid therapy. This was confirmed by reviewing the omali\u0002zumab record sheet. Results In these three cases, dual biologic therapy has been used to good effect, with no infection or other serious adverse events. This has also enabled patients to reduce oral CS dependence significantly, with the added benefit of minimizing CS-related adverse effects. Discussion The decision to start a patient on dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis, only when conventional treatment options have failed and in the context of life-threatening or significantly disabling disease. The main concerns regarding the use of dual biologic therapy centre around safety, especially a theoretical risk of serious infec\u0002tions [1]; no infections were seen in this small case series. This potential risk must be balanced carefully against the potential long-term harm from ongoing severe disease and the well\u0002documented risks associated with other adjuvant therapies, specifically CSs, which would be the most likely alternative treatment option in this group of difficult-to-treat patients. The number of patients requiring combination biological therapies is a small but important group. Data are sparse, be\u0002cause they are generally excluded from clinical trials. Thus, real-world data are important and needed to examine the long-term benefits and risks of different forms of combination biologic therapies across different disease areas.

This disease is  predominantly seen in patients with advanced renal  disease, yet non-uremic cases are also described. We  present a patient with non-uremic calciphylaxis who  had been admitted for acute exacerbation of heart  failure with a history of morbid obesity, asthma, and  prior warfarin use. This case illustrates the particular  diagnostic challenge of non-uremic calciphylaxis.  Case Synopsis  A 58-year-old woman with a history of diastolic heart  failure, asthma, morbid obesity, and warfarin use was  admitted to the hospital with an acute heart failure  exacerbation characterized by shortness of breath  and leg edema. Medications included atorvastatin,  aspirin, apixaban, albuterol, budesonide,  bumetanide, gabapentin, hydralazine, losartan, and  omalizumab. Of note, the patient was previously on  warfarin for 6 years and switched to apixaban one  year prior to presentation. Relevant admitting  laboratory tests include brain natriuretic peptide  1568pg/mL (normal: <100pg/mL), blood urea  nitrogen 20mg/dL (normal: 6 to 24mg/dL), creatinine  of 1.15mg/dL (normal: 0.7 to 1.3mg/dL), aspartate  aminotransferase (AST) 12U/L (normal: 8 to 33U/L),  alanine transaminase (ALT) 9U/L (normal: 7 to 55U/L),  calcium 8.8mg/dL (normal: 8.6 to 10.3mg/dL),  phosphate 3.3mg/dL (normal: 2.8 to 4.5mg/dL),  white blood cell count of 8.4\u00d7109 /L (normal: 4.5 to  11.0\u00d7109 /L) with elevated neutrophils and normal  eosinophilia, prothrombin time 13.9 (normal: 11 to  13.5 seconds), partial thromboplastin time 75  (normal: 21 to 35 seconds), platelets 261\u00d7109 /L  (normal: 150 to 400\u00d7109 /L), and international  normalized ratio (INR) 1.19 (normal: 0.8 to 1.1).  The patient reported recurrent, painful ulcers of her  lower extremities for three months prior to  admission to wound care clinic, which was presumed  to be related to stasis dermatitis secondary to  chronic heart failure. The patient\u2019s acute lower  extremity edema aggravated painful, chronic  ulcerations and retiform purpura of the left lower  extremity (Figure 1). Upon admission, she was  started on a 5-day course of cefazolin for suspected  cellulitis, later broadened to vancomycin due to  Abstract  A 58-year-old woman with a history of morbid  obesity, asthma, and prior warfarin use presented to  the hospital with shortness of breath and a three\u0002month history of painful, ulcerated ulcers with  retiform purpura of her bilateral distal extremities. A  punch biopsy specimen demonstrated focal necrosis  and hyalinization of the adipose tissue with subtle  arteriolar calcium deposition, findings consistent  with calciphylaxis. We discuss the presentation of  non-uremic calciphylaxis and review the risk factors,  pathophysiology, and interdisciplinary management  approach of this rare disease.

A dermatologist was  consulted and the patient subsequently underwent  a telescope punch biopsy of the left leg wound,  demonstrating focal necrosis and hyalinization of  the adipose tissue along with subtle calcium deposit  consistent with calciphylaxis (Figure 2).  Additional workup included elevated beta-2  microglobulin 5.38mg/L (normal: 1.1 to 2.4mg/L),  negative anticardiolipin antibodies, negative lupus  anticoagulant, negative rheumatoid factor, negative  anti-nuclear antibodies, negative anti-double  stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibodies (dsDNA),  negative anti-ribosomal P antibodies, negative anti\u0002Sj\u00f6gren syndrome type A (SSA) and anti-Sj\u00f6gren  syndrome type B (SSB) antibodies, anti-streptolysin  O 52IU/mL (normal: <200IU/mL), complement  factors C3 and C4 within normal limits (normal C3:  80-178mg/dl, C4: 12-42mg/dl), anti-neutrophil  cytoplasmic antibody screen negative, and negative  cryoglobulins. The patient also had HbA1c 5.8%  (normal: HbA1c <5.7%), Vitamin D 25-OH of  10.25ng/mL (normal: 20 to 50ng/mL), parathyroid  hormone of 68pg/mL (normal: 14 to 65pg/mL), and  negative human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B  virus, and hepatitis C virus antibody screens. Urine  toxicology was negative. Ankle-brachial index was  0.93 on the right leg and 0.87 on the left leg, showing  high pressures consistent with calcified vessels. A left  foot computed tomography scan showed soft tissue  edema and diffuse calcification suggestive of  calcified microvessels (Figure 3).  On hospital day 25, the patient was started on  intravenous thiosulfate 25g for three days a week  (Monday/Wednesday/Friday). On hospital day 38,  the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility  with continued improvement in her lower extremity  ulcers (Figure 4). The patient was continued on  sodium thiosulfate 25g for three days a week  (Monday/Wednesday/Friday) for 14 weeks, resulting  in full resolution of her lower extremity ulcers.  Case Discussion  Calciphylaxis is a microvascular occlusion disorder  characterized by metastatic arteriolar calcification  and cutaneous necrosis. It classically presents as  painful, violaceous reticular plaques and nodules  that commonly progress to necrotic ulcerations with  retiform purpura on the abdomen, buttocks, and  distal extremities [1]. The clinical presentation of  ulcers and retiform purpura can resemble other  Figure 1.

Volume 28 Number 6|November/December 2022|  28(6):6  - 3 -  Dermatology Online Journal || Case Report disease entities. The differential diagnosis for this  presentation includes microvascular occlusion  disorders (disseminated intravascular coagulation,  thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,  antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia, warfarin-induced skin necrosis),  embolic disease (cholesterol and septic emboli),  intravascular protein deposition (cryoglobulinemia,  cryofibrinogenaemia), vasculitis, or infectious  etiologies [2]. Clinical suspicion is important for an  early diagnosis. In this case, non-uremic calciphylaxis  was diagnosed based on the clinical presentation,  histopathology, and radiologic data.  Traditionally, skin biopsy with histopathologic  assessment was considered the most reliable  method of diagnosis. The telescope punch biopsy  technique can be used to sample deeper tissue in the  subcutis. This biopsy technique involves an initial  6mm punch biopsy to capture epidermis and dermis.  A 4mm punch biopsy is then telescoped into the  center of the 6mm defect, capturing deeper subcutis  [3]. However, histopathologic evaluation may be  equivocal and often requires multiple biopsies which  can delay treatment [4]. Radiologic imaging may  provide a more rapid diagnosis of calciphylaxis in  cases in which skin biopsy pathology is equivocal or  pending [5]. Imaging studies, including X-ray and  computed tomography, have been suggested to be  comparable to histopathology to diagnose  calciphylaxis [5,6]. Plain radiography is reported to  have a 90% specificity for netlike patterns of  calcification [7]. Bone scintigraphy is a highly  sensitive (89%) and specific (97%) tool as well [8].  Additional studies report that mammography,  ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging may  play an important role in detecting this disease  [9,10].  In our patient, the presence of bilateral ulcers and leg  edema from acute on chronic heart failure and the  previous diagnosis of stasis dermatitis caused a delay  in the identification of this condition (>3 months).  Understanding risk factors may improve initial  recognition of this disease. Pertinent risk factors for  non-uremic calciphylaxis in our patient included  female gender, morbid obesity, and a history of  corticosteroid and warfarin use. Additional  associations include malignancy, liver disease,  connective tissue disease, diabetes mellitus, and  Figure 3. 3-Dimensional rendering of computed tomography  scan without contrast of left leg showing curvilinear calcifications  that represent calcified microvessels.

Volume 28 Number 6|November/December 2022|  28(6):6  - 4 -  Dermatology Online Journal || Case Report derangements in calcium and phosphate  homeostasis [11,12]. Identifying risk factors and the  underlying etiology is important, as some  associations portend a more favorable prognosis. For  example, patients with warfarin-associated  calciphylaxis have a favorable prognosis [13],  whereas patients with nephrogenic calciphylaxis  experience worse survival outcomes [14]. In the  setting of nephrogenic calciphylaxis, one-year  mortality rates are high [11,12,15-17] and up to 50%  of patients are bedridden or wheelchair bound [18].  Patients experience chronic, debilitating pain that  may influence their quality of life [19]. Notably, our patient had been on warfarin for 6 years  and had been switched to apixaban one year prior to  this presentation. Warfarin use increases the risk of  calciphylaxis by a factor of 3 to 13 [2]. Warfarin uses  may precede the onset of calciphylaxis by one to 168  months[13]. The pathogenesis of warfarin\u0002associated calciphylaxis is not fully understood, but  evidence supports warfarin\u2019s inhibition of vitamin K\u0002dependent matrix GIa protein, which promotes  vascular calcification [20]. Warfarin also decreases  protein S secretion in endothelial cells, which may  promote local coagulopathy [20]. Warfarin\u0002associated calciphylaxis has a more favorable  prognosis, with a lower mortality rate (17%) than  uremic calciphylaxis (50-80%), [13].  Treatment for calciphylaxis is centered on inhibiting  the progression of vascular calcification and  correcting the underlying etiology. Strategies to  inhibit and decalcify vessels include correcting  electrolyte abnormalities and utilizing medications  such as sodium thiosulfate and vitamin K. The benefit  of sodium thiosulfate has been more thoroughly  studied in patients with nephrogenic calciphylaxis.  However, smaller case series have suggested that  sodium thiosulfate may also be an effective  treatment for non-uremic calciphylaxis, as noted in  this case [21]. Regardless of the treatment employed,  patient care involves a collaborative,  interdisciplinary approach. The interdisciplinary  team may include dermatologists, nephrologists,  wound care specialists, pain and palliative care  physicians, nutritionists, radiologists, and surgical  specialists [22]. These specialists played an integral  role in diagnosing nonuremic calciphylaxis in our  case and developing our treatment plan.  Conclusion  Herein, we describe nonuremic calciphylaxis in a 58- year-old woman presenting with multiple risk factors  (morbid obesity, corticosteroid use, and history of  warfarin use). This case illustrates the diagnostic  challenges of nonuremic calciphylaxis and reviews  the risk factors, pathophysiology, differential  diagnosis, diagnostic workup, and treatment for this  disease. Histopathologic evaluation and radiologic  data can be used to diagnose calciphylaxis.  Management includes local wound care and  systemic sodium thiosulfate. Multidisciplinary  collaboration between dermatologists,  nephrologists, radiologists, wound care specialists,  pain and palliative care physicians, and surgical  subspecialists is essential. Increased awareness of  this rare disease can lead to an earlier diagnosis and  improved patient outcomes.

She encountered a moder\u0002ate COVID-19 symptom severity score with fever and cough resolving at home without new cutaneous al\u0002terations. Patient\u2019s medical history revealed a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2, allergic asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, drug allergies (paracetamol, ibu\u0002profen), blood hypertension, endometriosis, and sleep apnoea syndrome.

In a large sample of cutaneous COVID-19 vaccine reactions to mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and Ad26.COV2.S, McMahon et al. found robust papules with overlying crusts, pityriasis rosea-like eruptions, pink papules with fine scale (V-REPP), bullous pemphigoid-like le\u0002sions, dermal hypersensitivity, herpes zoster, lichen\u0002planus-like lesions, urticarial, neutrophilic dermato\u0002sis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, morbilliform, delayed large local reactions, erythromelalgia, and others [1].

However, in\\nthis case, use of benzodiazepines provided a paradoxical and essential stimulating\\neffect. Conclusions: Catatonia is a rare consequence of brain injury and an under recognized manifestation as its clinical presentation may overlap with the primary brain\\ninjury itself. However, this case addresses the importance of recognizing this unique\\nentity. Use of benzodiazepines, in the appropriate population, has been supported and\\nmay completely change the outcome of a brain injured patient.

This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Japan and concerns a 51-year-old male patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection due to long-term use of corticosteroids, immunodeficiency secondary to corticosteroids associated with dexamethasone, prednisone and rituximab and organizing pneumonia due to Covid-19 associated with rituximab and prednisone. On September 7, 2020, the patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma presented to his doctor with a fever and was hospitalized. The patient had been treated with rituximab, which had last been administered in June 2020. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on a nasopharyngeal swab was positive, confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19. Twelve days after admission, the patient developed a high fever and hypoxia. More than 10 days had passed since the onset, so the symptoms were thought to be organizing pneumonia, and dexamethasone 6 mg/day was started. Temporarily, the patient needed 8 L of oxygen, but after starting steroid therapy his fever and respiratory status improved. After 10 days of dexamethasone administration, there was still a demand for oxygen, so 40 mg of prednisone was restarted as an organized pneumoniae after the COVID-19 infection. The prednisone dose was reduced to 30 mg, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on October 24, 2020. However, 5 days after discharge, the patient was readmitted due to a recurrence of fever. When the dose of prednisone was increased to more than 35 mg per day his fever declined, but with lower doses, the fever re-emerged. This pattern occurred repeatedly. Additionally, during the 3 months of treatment, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swabs remained positive. For further treatment, the patient was transferred to the hospital on November 30, 2020. The patient had no fever on admission to the hospital on a dose of 35 mg of prednisone per day. They thought that the long-term use of corticosteroids may be delaying clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus, so they reduced prednisone to 20 mg, and the patient was discharged on December 9, 2020, with no symptoms. In order to determine the amount of active virus, they submitted a sputum sample and nasopharyngeal swab for viral testing. However, the day after discharge, the patient developed fever again and was readmitted to the hospital on December 16, 2020. Viral isolation testing revealed viable virus (with a cytopathic effect on Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells) in both the nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples from the previous admission. Therefore, to reduce the amount of virus, remdesivir was administered for 10 days. PCR testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative on December 24, 2020, and the patient was discharged again on December 28. On January 19, 2021, the patient returned to the hospital with anosmia and a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test of a nasopharyngeal swab and viral culture was positive. They conducted SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome viral sequencing of virus isolated from sputum specimens collected on December 3, 2020 (during the first admission to the hospital) and on January 19, 2021. Both viral isolates had the same mutation in common, indicating persistent infection with the same viral strain rather than reinfection. At this time, the patient had no fever or hypoxia so they did not provide any treatment. A PCR test was negative a week later. The last administration of rituximab had been in June 2020. The effect of rituximab was thought to last about 6 months, so they assumed that the effect of rituximab had worn off and that his humoral immunity had recovered and cleared the virus. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM were all negative throughout his treatment, even after his SARS-CoV-2 PCR results became negative. They tapered the dose of prednisone and discontinued steroids on February 23, 2021. During the following 7 months of follow-up, the patient did not experience any subsequent relapses and did not require steroids. They encountered a case of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with significantly impaired B-cell immunity due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with rituximab. SARS-CoV-2 PCR and virus culture remained positive 133 days after the first PCR test. The ability to produce neutralizing antibodies was evaluated repeatedly, but no IgG, IgA or IgM production was observed, indicating probable rituximab-induced B cell dysfunction. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that viruses in the specimens collected on December 3, 2020, and January 19, 2021, were identical and consistent with persistent infection. In some cases, SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity was known to persist longer than a few weeks, but \u201cpositive\u201d PCR results do not necessarily mean the presence of the viable virus. Therefore, they at first thought this theory was also true to the case, meaning that there was a no longer a viable virus at the first discharge. Then they permitted him to discharge, but they could not confirm the PCR test negative, so they asked him to refrain from going to work. However, it revealed that the virus culture was also positive. Thus, they tried to reduce the amount of viable virus with remdesivir and decrease of corticosteroids, and moreover, the next time of discharge, they confirmed PCR negative twice. As to transmission of the virus, throughout the treatment and follow-up period, there was no episode of infection of the people around the patient. He lived with his wife, who transmitted the virus to the patient, and she never got reinfection. In the patient, as in previous reports, symptoms decreased after administration of remdesivir, but the patient relapsed and his SARS-CoV-2 PCR result became positive again. The patient differs from the patients described in previous case reports in that the patient recovered without any antibody treatment. In this case, it could be concluded that cell-mediated immunity cleared the virus in the absence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Coordinated immune responses of humoral and cell-mediated immunity are important for SARS-CoV 2 recovery. In this case, the use of rituximab was likely to have been the main cause of persistent infection, but decreasing the dose of corticosteroids might have helped to stimulate cell-mediated immunity. Actually, as the dose of corticosteroids was decreased, a slight upward trend in absolute lymphocyte counts was observed. The immunocompromised individuals are at risk of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection, and long-term use of corticosteroids may aggravate this risk. Therefore, as the prolonged use of corticosteroids not only provides anti-inflammatory effects but was also associated with delayed viral clearance due to cellular immunosuppression, it was important to consider early reduction of corticosteroid use in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. Corticosteroids were widely used to treat severe COVID-19, but in immunocompromised individuals, who are susceptible to persistent infection, long-term corticosteroid use may delay viral clearance. They present a case of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection in a man with significantly impaired B-cell immunity due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma which had been treated with rituximab. SARS-CoV-2 shedding persisted, despite treatment with remdesivir. Viral sequencing confirmed the persistence of the same viral strain, ruling out the possibility of reinfection. Although SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM remained negative throughout the treatment period, after reduction of the corticosteroid dose, PCR became negative. Long-term corticosteroid treatment, especially in immunocompromised individuals, may result in suppression of cell-mediated immunity and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ABSTRACT  Introduction: Post-acute withdrawal, also described as protracted, extended or persistent withdrawal, refers to a syndrome that includes anxiety, irritability, hostility, mood instability, fatigue, insomnia and increased physical complaints often related to gastrointestinal symptoms, pain and weakness. Unlike acute withdrawal, where treatment guidelines and practices are highly predictable and protocol driven; post\u0002acute interventions are highly symptom driven and individualized. Attention to co\u0002occurring medical and psychiatric disorders is vital as well. It is well-known that benzodiazepines pose greater risks to older adults including confusion, ataxia, syncope, risk of falls, fractures, delirium and excess hospitalizations. Even with these known risks about 20-25% of all inappropriate prescriptions for benzodiazepines are given to older adults. There is limited literature on managing post-acute withdrawal syndromes in older adults, with few available guidelines for medication management of emerging symptoms. The additional challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased both the stress on older adults in need of care and of providers seeking to engage patients in therapeutic relationships. We focus on representative cases of older adults seeking treatment related to benzodiazepines withdrawal and describe flexible treatment approaches for their evolving and complex needs. Methods: Cases studies were identified from the patient population at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, an urban medical center serving a multicultural and socioeconomically diverse population that includes several NORC sites. Mount Sinai Beth Israel has been serving the population of lower Manhattan since 1889 and provides full service behavioral health care including opioid treatment programs. Patients were identified from those who presented to the ambulatory care center that offers adult, geriatric and dual-diagnosis services. A personalized treatment planning approach was developed in each case and included the time period of the COVID-19 quarantine. Results: Mr A: 64 year old man with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Opioid Use Disorder in sustained remission on Methadone 270mg daily and Sedative Hypnotic Use Disorder. The patient entered treatment for impending Benzodiazepine withdrawal after losing his provider. He was taking alprazolam 2mg, clonazepam 6m and zolpidem 10mg daily over the past 30 years. Following treatment for acute withdrawal and treatment with a slow taper of clonazepam the patient has been struggling with episodic anxiety and feelings of loss. Isolation and boredom related to COVID-19 quarantine conditions have contributed to this making the issue of worsening anxiety with protracted withdrawal symptoms difficult to delineate. Ms B:74 year old woman with Generalized Anxiety Disorder entered Record downloaded - Fri 2 04 14:28:42 UTC 2022 Page 3 treatment after her provider closed his practice. The patient was prescribed diazepam 40mg, lorazepam 2mg and zolpidem 10mg daily for the past 5 years. In addition she was prescribed dextroamphetamine 20 mg daily for 3 years for fatigue. Over a 2 year period the medications were tapered using clonazepam; the dextroamphetamine was discontinued. While being maintained on clonazepam 0.5mg daily she started to complain of fearfulness, loneliness, insonia and chronic pain which increased with the onset of the COVID-19 quarantine. Mirtazpine 7.5mg was started at bedtime with improvement. Ms D: 59 year old woman with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, Alcohol Use Disorder, Cannabis Use Disorder and Cocaine Use Disorder treated with lorazepam 2 mg daily entered treatment after a previous provider was unable to administer Naltrexone LAI. The dose was reduces by 25% every 3 to 4 weeks while mirtazapine was utilized to manage emerging symptoms of depression and insomnia. Conclusions: We found that patients often entered treatment as a result of prior providers either refusing to continue prescribing benzodiazepines or limiting their practice. Patients responded well to engagement but under the increased stress of COVID-19 quarantine conditions symptoms increasingly emerged. Our population included patients who were also receiving MAT for sustained remission of Opioid Use Disorder and faced greater risks related to benzodiazepine use. Patients were receptive to educational interventions regarding the risks of continuing use and were able to engage in treatment. Despite the proven negative outcomes of chronic use providers continue to prescribe benzodiazepines inappropriately to older adults. The need to care for patients treated with these agents is high. Post-acute withdrawal syndrome is poorly understood and under recognized in older adults.

Corresponding author's email: nathan.kirsch@unlv.edu Case reports describing opportunistic fungal infections after treatment for Covid-19 pneumonia are becoming increasingly common in the literature1,2,3. These reports arose shortly after publication of the RECOVERY trial4 and the widespread use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia. Such infections typically involve either Candida or Aspergillus species, are generally limited to the lungs or bloodstream, and usually afflict those with severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Here we describe a case of chronic C. glabrata and A. niger pneumonia, and reactive arthritis, in a patient who had a mild Covid-19 infection.A 73- year-old male with a history of GOLD D chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous tobacco smoking, type II diabetes mellitus, and Covid-19 pneumonia 9 months prior presented to our pulmonary clinic complaining of a chronic non-productive cough and relapsing and remitting episodes of polyarticular arthralgia that had been present for the previous six months and serially treated with antibiotics. During the patient\u2019s hospitalization 9 months prior, the patient was treated with dexamethasone 6mg IV BID and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Review of the patient\u2019s chart did not reveal any evidence of frequent COPD exacerbations, or either hospital admission or outpatient treatment for any infectious diseases other than Covid-19, within the last year. Initial laboratory studies in clinic revealed no evidence of any hematologic or biochemical abnormalities. Computed Tomography of the patient\u2019s thorax only revealed right lower lobe bronchial \u201cdebris\u201d and emphysema. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the right lower lobe of the lung, with findings of C. glabrata and A. niger upon culture of the lavage fluid. Thereafter, the patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic, wherein treatment with a 3-month course of voriconazole was initiated. The patient symptoms resolved after 4 weeks of treatment.This case is significant because it represents an increasingly common pattern of opportunistic fungal infection after treatment for Covid-19 pneumonia. Interestingly, short courses of low dose steroids have been associated with opportunistic fungal infections5, which may explain our patient\u2019s infection. This case also highlights what may be the first reported case of reactive arthritis secondary to opportunistic fungal infection after treatment for Covid-19 pneumonia. The increasing ubiquity of glucocorticoid use in the treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia necessitates that clinicians be aware of the myriad of symptoms with which patients with opportunistic fungal infections may present. This is especially true in patients without a history of severe Covid-19 infections.

It  involves double-strand break, cell cycle, and cytoskeleton  and chromosome organization (1). SMARCA4-deficient  undifferentiated thoracic tumor (SMARCA4-UT) is a rare  malignancy that is more likely to occur in men and heavy  smokers (more than 20 pack-years). SMARCA4-UT often  has complete loss or diffuse dilution of Brahma related gene  1 (BRG1) expression. But INI-1 expression is retained. Most  cases also lose SMARCA2 expression.

Email: chunlantangok@126.com. Background: SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated thoracic tumor (SMARCA4-UT) is a rare malignant  condition with high invasiveness and poor prognosis. Presently, no clear guidelines are available for the  treatment of SMARCA4-UT. The median overall survival was only four to seven months. Several patients  are diagnosed in advanced stages of the malignancy and do not respond to conventional radiotherapy and  chemotherapy. Case Description: A 51-year-old Chinese man was diagnosed with a SMARCA4-UT. The patient  did not have a chronic history of hypertension or diabetes and any family history of malignant tumors. No  sensitive mutation in lung cancer-related ten genes was identified. The first-line therapy with four cycles of  liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin combined with two cycles of tyrosine kinase inhibitor anlotinib failed. On  immunohistochemical analysis, no programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was found. However,  whole-exon sequencing revealed a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) of 15.95 mutations/Mb with TP53 and  KEAP1 mutations. The patient was treated with a second-line regimen containing tislelizumab, etoposide, and  carboplatin (TEC). A reduction in tumor burden was seen for more than 10 months.  Conclusions: The case of SMARCA4-UT with a high mutation burden successfully responded to the  combined regimen containing TEC. This could be a new treatment option for patients with SMARCA4-UTs.

Cluster of  differentiation 34 (CD34) and Spalt like transcription factor  4 (SALL4) expressions are seen in 60% to 70% of cases (2).  The tumor cells do not lose mismatch repair (MMR)  proteins (3). SMARCA4 is the most often inactivated  subunit in the SWI/SNF complex, with a mutation rate of  about 0% to 10% in lung cancer patients. TP53, KRAS,  STK11, and KEAP1 mutation were found in 30% to 60%  of SMARCA4-UTs. The median overall survival (OS)  was only four to seven months (4). Several patients are  diagnosed in advanced stages of the malignancy and do not  respond to conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy  (5,6). Presently, there is no standard treatment for  SMARCA4-UTs. However, some recent studies have  shown that patients with SMARCA4-UT thoracic tumors  benefitted from immunotherapy (7-10), and the longest OS  time was up to 22 months. Tislelizumab is a programmed  cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody approved for the treatment of  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here in, we report a case of SMARCA4-UT that successfully responded to  the treatment containing tislelizumab, etoposide, and  carboplatin (TEC). A combination of immunotherapy and  chemotherapy may be a new treatment regimen for patients  with SMARCA4-UTs. We present the following case in  accordance with the CARE reporting checklist (available at  https://tcr.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tcr-22- 1679/rc). Case presentation  A 51-year-old Chinese male presented to our hospital  with the symptom of dry cough. He was a current smoker  with a history of 54 pack-years. The patient did not have a  chronic history of hypertension or diabetes and any family  history of malignant tumors. A chest computed tomography  (CT) revealed a 74 mm \u00d7 58 mm mass of the right upper  mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1). A CT-guided  percutaneous lung biopsy of the lung mass was performed.  Subsequent clinicopathological examination confirmed the  diagnosis of SMARCA4-UT (Figure 2) and the clinical stage  was T4N2M0 stage IIIB. The expressions of nine genes  (ALK, ROS1, RET, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, HER2, PIK3CA,  and MET) related to lung cancer were negative by real\u0002time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The  neoadjuvant therapy was recommended initially and then  the surgical intervention was evaluated. The patient was  treated with four cycles of liposomal paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 on day 1) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2  on day 1) combined with  two cycles of anlotinib (12 mg on days 1 to 14) as the first\u0002line therapy. A CT scan after four courses of induction  therapy demonstrated the disease progression. The tumor  mass was increased by 30% (92 mm \u00d7 96 mm) from the  pretreatment size according to the analysis by RECIST  version 1.1 (10). The patient experienced severe right  chest tightness and thoracalgia. On immunohistochemical  analysis, PD-L1 expression was not found. Next-generation  sequencing using the Burning Rock OncoScreen Cancer  Research Panel revealed a high tumor mutation burden  (TMB) at 15.95 mutations/Mb. TMB is defined as  the number of somatic mutations per Megabase of the  interrogated genomic sequence. A SMARCA4 mutation  was detected at the site of c.1105G>T in exon 6 with TP53 missense mutation (c.469G>T in exon 5) and a KEAP1 frameshift mutation (p.T418fs in exon 4). The patient  was treated with tislelizumab (200 mg on day 1 and then  every 3 weeks), etoposide (70 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3), and  carboplatin (350 mg/m2 on day 1) as a second-line treatment  due to high TMB. After one TEC administration, the  patient\u2019s chest tightness and thoracalgia were improved,  suggesting a possible clinical benefit. Strikingly, a partial  response (PR) was seen on a chest CT scan (Figure 1C) (11).  A chest CT scan after five cycles of TEC demonstrated a  sustained PR response but with secondary myelosuppression  (platelet count of 62\u00d7109 /L) (Figure 1D). Subsequently,  Highlight box Key findings \u2022 The case of SMARCA4-UT with a high mutation burden  successfully responded to the combined regimen containing  tislelizumab, etoposide, and carboplatin. What is known and what is new? \u2022 Here is known: presently, no clear guidelines are available for the  treatment of SMARCA4-UT; \u2022 Here is new: etoposide and carboplatin combined with tislelizumab  were used as the second-line treatment and exhibited good  therapeutic effects. What is the implication, and what should change now? \u2022 It means that gene sequencing and PD-L1 expression should be  performed after the diagnosis of all advanced SMARCA4-UTs.  For tumors that respond poorly to radiotherapy and chemotherapy  (including SMARCA4-UTs), immunotherapy can be tried if  there is no immunotherapy hyper-progression gene and there  is the existence of possible markers to evaluate the benefit from  immunotherapy.

Disease-free survival (DFS) has been maintained for more  than ten months since the beginning of TEC treatment.  The clinicopathologic characteristics of this SMARCA4- UT patient and previous cases are summarized in Table 1. All procedures performed in this study were in  accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional  and/or national research committee(s) and with the Helsinki  Declaration (as revised in 2013). Written informed consent  was obtained from the patient for publication of this case  report and accompanying images. A copy of the written  consent is available for review by the editorial office of this  journal. Discussion  SMARCA4-UT is a type of NSCLC with large atypia and  low differentiation. It is highly malignant and has a short  survival time. There is no standard treatment at present.  It is classified under the other lung epithelial tumors of  thoracic tumors in the 2021 edition by the World Health  Organization (WHO) (12). In early cases, it can be  surgically resected, but in late or advanced cases, it relies  on radio chemotherapy although it does not respond well  (5,13). Presently, the treatment of advanced NSCLC is  recommended (14). The first-line therapy with two cycles of chemotherapy  failed in this case. The tumor size increased, and the disease  progressed significantly. The first line of chemotherapy  combined with anti-tumor angiogenesis treatment also  failed, which was consistent with the previous reports (5,15).  In recent years, a small number of reports have shown that  immunotherapy benefitted SMARCA4-UT patients (8,16).  Studies also found that most SMARCA4-UTs had negative  PD-L1 expression but exhibited high TMB. Among the  major drivers of NSCLC, the loss of either KEAP1 or  STK11-induced TMB (17,18). Since somatic mutations  generate neoantigens, high TMB is expected to induce an  anti-tumor response. However, it can serve as a biomarker  predicting favorable responses to immune checkpoint  blockades (ICB) (19-21). The prediction of high TMB  on the efficacy of immunotherapy was not affected by the  expression of PD-L1. Due to such reason, some patients  benefitted from immunotherapy and had significantly  prolonged survival (16,22,23).  However, poor effects of immunotherapy and severe  A B C D Figure 1 Chest computed tomography images: (A) Baseline before treatment; (B) progressive disease after four cycles of chemotherapy and  2 cycles of anlotinib; (C) partial response after two doses of tislelizumab, etoposide, and carboplatin; (D) after five doses of tislelizumab,  etoposide, and carboplatin.  1044 Yang et al. TEC was effective for SMARCA4-UT thoracic tumor \u00a9 Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved. Transl Cancer Res 2023;12(4):1041-1048 | https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/tcr-22-1679 progression were also reported (24). Some studies revealed  that the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC  exhibited primary resistance to ICB (20,25). The tumor  microenvironment (TME) is a mixture of tumor cells and  endogenous host stroma that influence cancer growth and  development. The TME can influence the disease prognosis  and antitumor immunity. Furthermore, it can influence the  outcome and effectiveness of cancer management therapies.  Gantzer et al. identified nine SMARCA4-UT patients  and eight patients had no tertiary lymphoid structures,  consistent with an immune desert TME phenotype (26). In  this case, next-generation sequencing was performed and  immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy was selected.  After this treatment regimen, the tumor size became smaller  and the symptoms were relieved, suggesting effective  treatment. SMARCA4-UT does not express PD-L1 but exhibits  high TMB and is often accompanied by co-mutations  of TP53, KRAS, KEAP1, and STK11. Dong et al. found  that patients with KRAS and TP53 mutations benefitted  from immunotherapy (27). STK11 is a negative immune  regulatory gene. KEAP1 gene is controversial in predicting  the efficacy of immunotherapy (28). The co-mutation of  STK11 and KEAP1 genes result in a poor prognosis with  immunotherapy in lung cancers with high TMB. This  outcome may cause poor response and severe progression  in some SMARCA4-UTs after using immune checkpoint  inhibitors. About 23% of lung adenocarcinoma and 34% of lung  squamous cell carcinoma exhibited KEAP1 mutation and  the patients with KEAP1 gene mutation were often heavy  smokers, which were characterized by over expression of PD\u0002L1 and high TMB (defined as more than10 mutations/Mb).  However, the median OS time was not improved after the  use of immunotherapeutic drugs due to less T cell infiltration  (cold tumor) (29,30). But the results of some studies were  A B C D E F Figure 2 Histomorphology and immunohistochemical features of thoracic SMARCA4-UT. (A) Hematoxylin and eosin staining (\u00d7200).

A survey on patients harboring KEAP1 mutation in different types of cancers in China found that  the mutation rate of KEAP1 mutation was the highest in lung  squamous cell carcinoma (about 29%) and the survival time  of patients harboring mutation treated with immunotherapy  was significantly improved compared with other therapies  (median OS: 22.52 vs. 12.89 months, P=0.0034) (31). Checkmate227 study showed that patients with KEAP1 mutation had significantly higher PFS (11.1 months)  than those with KEAP1 wild type (5.5 months) (32).  The keynote-042 study showed that regardless of the  mutation status of KEAP1, pablizumab was more effective  than platinum-containing chemotherapies (33). To elucidate the effect of KEAP1 and TP53 gene co\u0002mutation on the prognosis of patients, Professor Saleh  et al. conducted a retrospective study to analyze the clinical  and gene mutation spectrum data in 6,297 patients with  NSCLC. The analysis found that 51.5% (3,245/6,297)  patients had TP53 mutation, of which 17.3% (524/3,022)  patients had KEAP1 gene co-mutation. Compared with  patients with wild-type TP53/KEAP1 or other types of  TP53 mutation, patients with TP53 truncation mutation  (including frameshift mutation and nonsense mutation) or  KEAP1 mutation had significantly shorter OS and DFS,  which were negative independent prognostic factors.  However, the coexistence of KEAP1 mutation with other  types of TP53 (including missense/synonymous/in-frame  mutation) brought survival benefits. The mutant TP53 might have played an important role in modifying the  KEAP1-NRF2 signaling pathway (34). The coexistence of  KEAP1 and TP53 missense mutations in this patient may  have been another main reason for the objective remission  and survival benefits of the use of immune checkpoint  inhibitors. Conclusions  SMARCA4-UT is a rare malignant condition with high  invasiveness and poor prognosis. It does not respond to  chemoradiotherapy. In this case, the first-line treatment  containing paclitaxel combined with cisplatin and anlotinib  was ineffective. Therefore, etoposide and carboplatin  combined with tislelizumab were used as the second\u0002line treatment and exhibited good therapeutic effects.  Immunotherapy may be a new treatment option for  patients with SMARCA4-UTs and when combined with  chemotherapy may provide a better effect. This case did  not express PD-L1 but expressed KEAP1 mutation. Several  studies found that patients with KEAP1 mutation had a  poor therapeutic effect with immune checkpoint inhibitors  (29,30). However, this patient with high TMB and TP53 missense mutation benefitted from the treatment regimen.  A single index is not an ideal biomarker for predicting  the efficacy of immunotherapy. For tumors that respond  poorly to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (including  SMARCA4-UTs), immunotherapy can be tried if there is  no immunotherapy hyper-progression gene and there is the  existence of possible markers to evaluate the benefit from  immunotherapy.

Montes-Moreno et al,4 described  three morphologic subgroups: a large cell subtype  composed of numerous large cells, a second one  showing HRS-like large cells resembling classic  Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), and a third subtype  resembling T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell  lymphoma showing only a few or no HRS-like cells. Composite lymphoma (CL) is defined as two  or more distinct lymphoid neoplasms that occur in  the same site.5,6 CL is very rare, representing only  1\u20134.7% of all lymphoma cases.7  It can occur in  various combinations, including composite B-cell  lymphoma, composite B- and T-cell lymphoma, and  composite HL and non-HL (NHL).6  It can develop  synchronously or metachronously.8\u201310 A diffuse  large B-cell lymphoma developing metachronously  in nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL is  the commonest type of CL.10 In some cases of  CL, polymerase chain reaction amplification  and sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin  heavy chain gene have demonstrated common  clonal origins.11,12 The latter is thought to be the  common precursor of cells that are genetically  identical but morphologically different due to  different transformation events.8  Metachronously  developed cases may be due to complications from  previous chemotherapy associated with immune  dysregulation. We report an unusual case of peripheral T-cell  lymphoma (PTCL), NOS that seemed to develop  metachronously in the patient with EBV+ DLBCL,  NOS with HRS-like cells.

ABSTRACT We report a case of an elderly male who presented with enlarged abdominal lymph nodes  and was diagnosed as having Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,  not otherwise specified (EBV+ DLBCL, NOS). He was started on chemotherapy which  had to be discontinued after three cycles due to the development of life-threatening  pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and poor performance status. Within two years, the  patient presented with features of relapse. A repeat histopathological examination of the  lymph node showed features of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS and the clonality was  confirmed by T-cell receptor gamma chain rearrangement assay. More studies are needed  to understand the association of EBV+ DLBCL, NOS with other lymphomas. Oman med J, vol 38, no 2, march 2023 L atha Abraham, et al. *Corresponding author: \uf02amobinpaul99@gmail.com revealed enlarged axillary lymph nodes and mild  splenomegaly. Hemogram and peripheral blood  smear examination showed normochromic anemia  with leukopenia and mild thrombocytopenia. Serum  lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid levels were  mildly elevated. Radiological imaging confirmed  splenomegaly and additionally revealed the presence  of enlarged para-aortic and peripancreatic lymph  nodes. Bone marrow examination, conducted  in view of pancytopenia, yielded normal results.  Histopathological examination of the left axillary  lymph node showed features of reactive lymphoid  hyperplasia. Laparoscopic para-aortic lymph node  biopsy revealed a lymph node 3 \u00d7 2 cm in size with  a homogenous, grey-white cut surface. Microscopic  sections showed small lymphocytes arranged  in a nodular pattern with many scattered large  mononuclear, multilobed, and multinucleated cells  having abundant cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei with  prominent eosinophilic nucleoli. A few lacunar cells,  mummified cells, and clusters of histiocytes were also  seen [Figure 1]. The large cells were positive for cluster  of differentiation (CD) 30, CD20, and paired box 5,  but negative for leukocyte common antigen , CD3,  and CD15. A mixture of CD20 and CD3-positive  lymphocytes formed the background population. A  second panel of immunostains performed showed  diffuse strong positivity for EBV-latent membrane  protein 1, multiple myeloma 1, and B cell-specific  octamer-binding protein-1, weak positivity for  octamer-binding protein 2, and fascin negativity  in the large cells. MIB-1 proliferation index was  80% [Figure 2]. Epstein-Barr encoding region in  situ hybridization was not done due to logistic  reasons. A final impression of EBV+ DLBCL, NOS  was rendered. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan  showed F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid  multiple supra and infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes,  spleen, and marrow spaces of axial skeleton (Ann  Arbor Stage IV). Quantitative polymerase chain  reaction for EBV conducted on blood detected  19959 copies/mL. Tests ruled out immunodeficiency  and autoimmune diseases. The patient was planned  for R mini cyclophosphamide, vincristine,  doxorubicin, and prednisone 21 \u00d7 6 cycles. After  three cycles, the patient attained complete FDG  PET metabolic response and molecular complete  remission. However, as he also developed severe  pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and severe renal  failure, chemotherapy was discontinued, and  rituximab maintenance was initiated. c d a b Figure 1:(a) Para-aortic lymph node biopsy showing small lymphocytes arranged in nodular pattern  with many scattered large cells (hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) = 100 \u00d7), (b) large mononuclear cells  (black arrow) and multinucleated giant cells (red arrow) (H&E = 400 \u00d7), (c) classic Reed-Sternberg like  cells (red arrow) (H&E = 400 \u00d7), (d) a few lacunar cells (red arrow) and mummified cells (black arrow).

Ultrasonogram revealed borderline  splenomegaly and multiple intra-abdominal enlarged  lymph nodes with perinodal fat stranding. Whole  body PET scan imaging revealed FDG-avid right  axillary and deep pectoral, para-aortic, aortocaval,  retrocaval, mesenteric, and iliac nodes. Trucut biopsy  of the axillary and para-aortic lymph nodes showed a  dense infiltrate composed of lymphoid cells, histiocytes,  plasma cells, and neutrophils. The lymphoid cells were  intermediate-sized with scant to moderate cytoplasm,  clumped to vesicular nuclei with irregular to clefted  nuclear contours, and inconspicuous nucleoli. A few ill\u0002formed histiocytic collections were also seen [Figure 3].  Special stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungal organisms  were non-contributory. Immunohistochemical stains  showed that the intermediate-sized lymphoid cells were  positive for CD3, CD5, and CD4, and were negative  for CD7, CD8, CD10, CD20, CD56, CD30, paired  box 5, multiple myeloma 1 , BCL6, and EBV latent  membrane protein 1. Ki-67 proliferation index was  about 50%. T h e h i s t o m o r p h o l o g i c a l a n d  immunohistochemical findings were suggestive of  PTCL, NOS.

The patient was started on  chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine,  and prednisolone protocol; however, he succumbed  to his illness. DISCUSSION EBV+ DLBCL, NOS is a distinct lymphoid  neoplasm recognized in the World Health  Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms  (4th edition, 2016) and is associated with a poor  response to chemotherapy and short survival.1  It  was previously designated as EBV+ DLBCL of the  elderly as most patients tended to be elderly. Of late,  it has been reported over a wide age range and is more  common among Asian and Latin American patients  compared to Western patients.13,14 Involvement can  be nodal or extranodal, the most common extranodal  sites being lungs and gastrointestinal tract.14 In some  cases, the neoplastic component consists of a variable  number of large transformed cells on a background  of a mixed population of small lymphocytes,  plasma cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils, imparting  c d e f b a CD: cluster of differentiation; LCA: leukocyte common antigen; PAX5: paired Box 5; EBV: epstein-Barr virus; LMP1: latent membrane protein 1. Figure 2:(a) Para-aortic lymph node biopsy showing CD30 positive large cells (CD30 = \u00d7 400), (b) the  large cells are seen negative for CD15 (CD15 = 400 \u00d7), (c) the large cells seen negative for LCA (LCA = 400  \u00d7), (d) the large cells are seen positive for CD20 (CD20 = 400 \u00d7), (e) the large cells are positive for PAX5  (PAX5 = 400 \u00d7), (f ) the large cells are positive for EBV-LMP1 (EBV-LMP1 = 400 \u00d7). Oman med J, vol 38, no 2, march 2023 L atha Abraham, et al. L atha Abraham, et al. a morphologic overlap with cHL. When the  background reactive component is rich in small  lymphocytes and histiocytes, the so-called  polymorphic pattern, resembling T-cell/histiocyte\u0002rich large B-cell lymphoma, is the most common  pattern in young patients.15 The monomorphic  pattern can be distinguished from EBV- DLBCL  with ancillary studies only. The neoplastic cells are  typically positive for the pan-B-cell antigens with  an activated B-cell immunophenotype.14 CD30 is  usually positive with occasional CD15 coexpression,  but lacks other phenotypic features typical of cHL.  The disease has an aggressive course, even when  treated with combination chemotherapy.16 CL is an uncommon lymphoid malignancy with  a variety of patterns. The most common types are  B-cell NHL composite with HL or two composite  B-cell NHLs of different types.6  CL consisting of  B-cell and T-cell neoplasms are extremely rare,  constituting < 1% of all lymphoid malignancies, and  the pathologic features of this type have not been  well characterized.17 Among the reported cases of  this subtype, the T-cell neoplasms were most often  PTCL, NOS whereas the B-cell components were  diverse with DLBCL being the most frequently  followed by marginal zone lymphoma and other low\u0002grade B-cell lymphomas, HL, and plasmacytoma.  Most of these cases were of nodal origin, whereas in  a minority of cases, they arose in extranodal tissues. Though the exact pathogenesis of CL remains  unclear, a few mechanisms have been hypothesized.18 One possible etiology of CL is the viral-induced  transformation of two or more separate neoplastic  clones. This oncogenic activity has been observed  most frequently in EBV in immunocompromised  patients. EBV-related large B-cell lymphoma has  been described in association with PTCL and  angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) in a  simultaneous or sequential occurrence.19 It has been  thought that EBV antigens expressed in host B-cells  may stimulate T-cell proliferation and eventually  induce neoplastic transformation of T-cells, via  a process of clonal selection. Another hypothesis  is immunodeficiency associated with T-cell  c d a b Figure 3:(a) Right axillary lymph node biopsy showing dense infiltrate composed of lymphoid cells,  histiocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils.

L atha Abraham, et al. malignancy predisposes the patient to EBV infection  which causes clonal transformation of B-cells in  the host.20 This case report adds to the knowledge of the  natural history of EBV+ DLBCL, NOS which is a  newly described entity. Further studies are required  to understand the pathogenesis of metachronous  EBV+ DLBCL, NOS and PTCL. CONCLUSION This report presents a noteworthy case of EBV+  DLBCL, NOS, which initially presented as intra\u0002abdominal lymphadenopathy with metachronous  development of PTCL, NOS. Being a newly  recognized entity, the course of this rare disease  needs further study. Disclosure The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

AS may present  as primary tumors of the breast or as secondary  lesions usually associated with previous radio\u0002therapy. Commonly, secondary AS affects old\u0002er women (median age 67-71 years) with a clin\u0002ical history of breast cancer. The preferred site  of onset of RIAS is the edge of radiation fields,  where radiation doses and tumor necrosis may  be heterogeneous, resulting in a DNA damage  and instability. Radical surgery is the treatment  of choice, but no clear consensus exists on sur\u0002gical management of breast AS.  CASE REPORT: We describe an atypical case  of relapsed RIAS after radical mastectomy, treat\u0002ed with new surgery and, considering the higher  risk of recurrence, subsequent adjuvant chemo\u0002therapy with weekly paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of radiation-in\u0002duced angiosarcomas (RIAS) after breast-con\u0002serving surgery and radiotherapy has been in\u0002creased to 0.14-0.5% among long survivors. Nev\u0002ertheless, even if RIAS continues to be prognos\u0002tically an extremely unfavorable cancer due to a  high rate of recurrence, distant spread, and me\u0002dian overall survival (OS) of about 60 months, the  benefits of loco-regional breast radiotherapy are  clearly higher than the risk in developing angio\u0002sarcoma.

Introduction Angiosarcoma (AS) of the breast is very rare,  accounting for 1% of all soft tissue breast tumors.  AS may present as primary tumors of the breast  or as secondary lesions usually associated with  previous radiotherapy. They should be considered  as two separate clinical entities, with aggressive  behavior and poor prognosis1 . Primary ASs account for <0.04% of malignant  neoplasms and has been observed in younger  women, usually aged between 30 and 50 years;  the most frequent clinical presentation is a poorly  defined mass of the breast, which typically orig\u0002inates from the parenchyma and grows rapidly.  Unlike secondary AS, skin involvement is most\u0002ly occasional, with purple discoloration of the  overlying skin and apparent bruising. Due to its  non-specific clinical and imaging manifestations,  and different histopathological manifestations, it  is difficult to accurately diagnose it before sur\u0002gery, often resulting in missed diagnosis or mis\u0002diagnosis2 . Secondary AS affects older women (median age  67-71 years) with history of breast cancer. It fre\u0002quently arises in the dermal and subdermal layers  and may not necessarily involve the parenchyma,  presenting as painless bruising that is frequently  multifocal, purplish discoloration, eczematous rash,  hematoma-like swelling, diffuse breast swelling or  less commonly as single or multifocal cutaneous  European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences 2023; 27: 4169-4174 M.

A case report and review of the literature M. Caterino, M. De Felice, L. Poliero, G. Mazzarella, M. Pirozzi, et al 4170 mass. This clinical presentation may be easily mis\u0002taken for bruising or benign skin changes, leading  to delayed diagnosis. Secondary ASs may occur  in the context of long-standing chronic lymphede\u0002ma after total mastectomy and axillary dissection  (Stewart-Treves syndrome), usually between 5 and  15 years after the surgery, or after breast radiother\u0002apy [radiation-induced angiosarcoma (RIAS)]1,3,4. In  scientific literature the median time of RIAS pre\u0002sentation is from 5 to 10 years after radiotherapy,  with case series reporting latency over 20 years5 .  The preferential site of onset of RIAS is the edge  of radiation fields, where radiation doses and tumor  necrosis may be heterogeneous, resulting in DNA  damage and instability1 . Both primary and second\u0002ary ASs may lead to platelet sequestration, hemor\u0002rhagic manifestations, and several cases of dissem\u0002inated intravascular coagulation by consumption  coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merrit syndrome) have  been reported in scientific literature6-9.  Ultrasound and mammography are non-spe\u0002cific, and primary AS can be mistaken for a  breast carcinoma or a benign lesion. In both pri\u0002mary and secondary AS, magnetic resonance im\u0002aging (MRI) scan is helpful in determining the  malignancy of the lesion. Necrosis or bleeding  areas affect the appearance in T1-weighted and  T2-weighted images of MRI, while contrasto\u0002graphic behavior shows significant heterogeneous  enhancement in the early phase and varying de\u0002grees of concentric enhancement in the delayed  phase. The dynamic contrast enhancement curves  may show plateau pattern or washout pattern10.  Fine needle aspiration (FNA) or Core-needle  biopsy (CNB) are required for diagnosis of pri\u0002mary AS, while secondary AS generally needs an  excisional biopsy or skin punch. Biopsy methods  may be complicated by post-procedural bleeding.  Prognosis is poor in both types due to the high  rate of recurrence. Although data are controver\u0002sial, high-grade tumors seem to have lower dis\u0002ease-free survival (DFS) and OS compared to low  and intermediate grade tumors. The role of tumor  size is unclear, while infiltration of surgical mar\u0002gins is associated with increased risk of local and  distant recurrence and worse prognosis. Local and distant recurrence is frequent, espe\u0002cially in high grade tumors and R1 excisions. An\u0002giosarcoma preferentially spreads by the hematog\u0002enous route, although lymphatic spread has been  more rarely documented. The lung is the most fre\u0002quent site of metastasis, although irregular patterns  of metastasizing (intestine, tonsils, heart, buttock)  have been reported in scientific literature. Radical surgery is the standard care, but no  clear consensus exists on surgical management of  breast AS. Axillary nodes excision is usually per\u0002formed, but its role is debated because lymphatic  spread is uncommon; analogously, also adjuvant  chemotherapy is controversial1,11. Case Report The patient is a 58-years old woman. In her  clinical history, she presented high blood pres\u0002sure, iatrogenic hypothyroidism as a result of post  thyroidectomy due to goiter, lower limbs venous  insufficiency and a previous transient ischemic  attack (TIA) in 2014. No family history of cancer. In October 2011, patient underwent surgery for  supero-external quadrantectomy of right breast  and homolateral lymph nodes dissection for intra\u0002ductal breast cancer, stage pT1mic pN0, estrogen  receptor (ER) 80%, progesterone receptor (PgR)  negative, ki67 70% and HER2 negative. After  surgery, she was treated with adjuvant radiother\u0002apy for a total dose of 60 Gy: 50 Gy on residual  right mammary gland (2 Gy/day, 5 days/week)  and 10 Gy on tumor bed (2 Gy/day, 5 days/week).  Radiotherapy was followed by 5 years hormono\u0002therapy (tamoxifen for two years and letrozole for  three years).  During the following seven years, the patient  practiced regular follow-up with blood tests, tumor  markers, breast ultrasounds, mammograms, and  computed tomography (CT) scans. All exams were  negative until October 2018 when patient noted  the appearance of a millimetric nodule around the  areola of right breast, near the scar from the previ\u0002ous surgery. This lesion grew fast and in February  2019 excision was performed. Histological report  showed evidence of high-grade angiosarcoma,  caused by previous radiotherapy (RT).  In March 2019 patient underwent right mas\u0002tectomy with removal of pectoralis major muscle  fascia and ipsilateral node sampling; after that,  patient started follow-up.  In July 2021 during a follow-up visit, the physi\u0002cian saw a reddish-brown lump on right chest skin. In September 2021 patient underwent FNA of  this lump, but the result of the procedure was not  conclusive to formulate a diagnosis. For this rea\u0002son, the following month the patient underwent  surgery once again and the nodule was removed;  histology was compatible with relapse of high  grade angiosarcoma, associated with previous  RT, as seen in Figure 1. Is there a role for adjuvant therapy in radiation-induced angiosarcoma of the breast?  4171 Considering the recurrent disease, adjuvant che\u0002motherapy was proposed to the patient with weekly  paclitaxel 80 mg/sqm on day 1, 8 and 15 on a every  28 days schedule, for five cycles.  In January 2022 patients started chemotherapy.  The first two cycles were well tolerated; by the third  cycle patient had grade 1 acroparesthesia on her  fingers as collateral effects so 25 mg of pregabalin  in therapy was added. For hematological toxicities  (grade 2 neutropenia) patient continued treatment,  for last two cycle, with dosage reduced to 80%. The  patients is currently in follow-up. Discussion Nowadays the frequency of RIAS after  breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy has  increased to 0.14-0.5% among long survivors. Nev\u0002ertheless, even if RIAS continues to be prognosti\u0002cally an extremely unfavorable cancer due to the  high rate of recurrence, distant spread and median  overall survival of about 60 months, the benefits of  loco-regional breast radiotherapy are clearly higher  than the risk of developing angiosarcoma12.  The association between ionizing radiation  exposure and secondary malignancies has been  extensively described in the epidemiologic liter\u0002ature, even if pathogenesis of RIAS is still un\u0002known, nor it is explained whether it is a dose-de\u0002pendent radiation-induced cancer13. It may be  that photons directly damage DNA structure  inducing DNA double-strand breaks, generat\u0002ing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidize  the double-layered cellular membrane and DNA  too14. The direct oncogenic effects of ionizing ra\u0002diation lead to genomic instability and mutations  of specific oncogenes, some of which specifically  used to differentiate radiation-induced from spo\u0002radic sarcomas: among these, the most frequent  are the inactivation of p53 gene and amplification  of the 8q24 region containing myelocytomato\u0002sis (MYC) proto-oncogene15,16. An association  between breast cancer-related tumor-suppressor  (BRCA) 1-2 genes and RIAS is under investiga\u0002tion, considering the well-known parallelism with  radiation-induced genome instability: in this way  investigating micro-satellite instability (MSI) sta\u0002tus would be useful to understand AS carcino\u0002genesis17,18. Moreover, it could be hypothesized  that radiation-induced chronic lymphedema may  interfere with repair mechanisms, promoting un\u0002controlled neoangiogenesis through gene ampli\u0002fication of Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4),  that encode vascular endothelial growth factor  receptor (VEGFR) 3, and kinase insert domain re\u0002ceptor (KDR) gene mutations, encoding VEGFR 2: the former reported in 25% of secondary AS  Figure 1.

Poliero, G. Mazzarella, M. Pirozzi, et al 4172 and always in association with MYC amplifica\u0002tion, the latter described in 10% of patients with  AS. Specifically, this mutation seems to clearly  identify AS of the breast, regardless of a previous  exposure to radiotherapy19.  In this regard histological diagnosis, funda\u0002mental in the therapeutic algorithm, always re\u0002quires an excisional biopsy that allows a careful  microscopic and above all immunohistochemi\u0002cal analysis20. In fact, a critical point is to mor\u0002phologically differentiate healthy vascular and  endothelial cells from neoplastic ones, consider\u0002ing that the two components could also coexist  surrounded by abundant inflammatory infiltrate,  which contributes to making diagnosis more  complex. Differential diagnosis includes heman\u0002giomas, Massons\u2019s tumor and atypical vascular  proliferation; typical vascular markers include  clusters of differentiation (CD) CD31, CD34, Fol\u0002licular Lymphoma Susceptibility to 1 (FL1) and  factor VIII related antigen, often co-expressing  epithelial antigens such as epithelial membrane  antigen (EMA), Cam 5.2 and pankeratin AE1/318.  MYC immunohistochemical positivity is regarded  as a specific marker, present in more than 67%  secondary angiosarcomas and completely neg\u0002ative in primary angiosarcoma and secondary  atypical vascular lesions; moreover, its amplifica\u0002tion seems to be a marker of worse prognosis18,21.  However a negative result does not entirely rule  out secondary angiosarcoma. In addition, Notch  homolog 1, translocation-associated (NOTCH 1)  immunoreactivity, a signaling pathway regulating  mesenchymal transition, has been observed espe\u0002cially in moderately- or well-differentiated cancer  according to F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale des Centres de  Lutte Contre Le Cancer (FNCLCC) grading sys\u0002tem21. So, it appears clear that a simple fine-need  aspiration biopsy may not be sufficient in formu\u0002lating the right diagnosis. Cahan et al13 assessed the four criteria for the  diagnosis of RIAS: history of RT, asymptomatic  latency period of several years (5 or more), occur\u0002rence of sarcoma within a previously irradiated  field, and histologic confirmation of the sarcoma\u0002tous nature. In the literature it was later described  that RIAS could develop either less than 6 months  or more than 40 years after radiotherapy, with an  average latency of about 6 years. The cornerstone of the treatment is surgery  with negative margins (R0). There are no ran\u0002domized trials comparing a conservative ap\u0002proach to mastectomy. Total mastectomy alone  or with axillary node dissection is the preferred  surgical treatment, with conservative surgery  used only in smaller lesions when a R0 resection  is considered possible. No clear data on axillary  nodal dissection are available as nodal metastases  are not common. Adjuvant radiotherapy should  only be considered for close soft tissue margins,  also considering that angiosarcoma is believed to  be radioresistant and refractory to radical dos\u0002es22. In a systematic review Depla et al23 reported  a 57% of 5-year local control rate with post-op\u0002erative irradiation compared to 37% of surgery  alone, although with no significant difference in  OS. However, in case of inoperable lesion, widely  infiltrated to the skin and the muscle layer, RIAS  should be treated with three-dimensional con\u0002formal radiotherapy, as described by Ikenohira  et al24. Re-irradiation of the breast after previous  surgery and RT may be well-tolerated, as pointed  out by RTOG 1014 trial25 and some retrospective  experiences26, with tissue fibrosis less than 2%  and skin necrosis of 1%. Current indications for the choice of systemic  treatment for RIAS are borrowed from angiosar\u0002comas trials, regardless of site. Penel et al28 had  previously reported in ANGIOTAX study27 that  weekly paclitaxel administration was well-tol\u0002erated and has a significant impact on OS in the  first line setting, while PALETTE trial28 assessed  a benefit in PFS for Pazopanib in a second-line  treatment. Specifically, in the Phase II ANGIO\u0002TAX study 327, patients with locally advanced  breast AS were converted to resectable after a  treatment with Paclitaxel; 2 of them obtained a  complete response to the histological examina\u0002tion.  National Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN) guidelines recommend docetaxel, pa\u0002clitaxel and vinorelbine for metastatic AS, high\u0002lighting that the role of adjuvant therapy is still  debated, and a decision should be made case by  case because the majority of the data is based  on small retrospective studies22, lacking strong  conclusions and coming to conflicting findings.  Nakamura et al29 reported a breast RIAS without  metastasis who underwent mastectomy and adju\u0002vant chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel with  absence of recurrence for 15 months. Moreover,  Suzuki et al20 described a radiation-induced an\u0002giosarcoma of the breast, surgically excised with  a mastectomy, that recurred one month after sur\u0002gery with a nodule on the surgical scar. Their  choice has been to propose a re-surgery and ad\u0002juvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel considering  the higher risk of recurrence20. Is there a role for adjuvant therapy in radiation-induced angiosarcoma of the breast?  4173 Conclusions RIAS represents a rare and challenging di\u0002agnosis, which could negatively impact patients\u2019  prognosis and quality of life; its intrinsic clinical  features, however, favor expert clinicians to un\u0002dertake the right therapeutic procedures.  Our clinical experience reflects what has  already been previously reported by Suzuki  et al20. In view of the rapid recurrence of the  disease despite a first radical treatment, it was  preferred to proceed with a new oncological  radical surgery and subsequent adjuvant treat\u0002ment with weekly paclitaxel considering an  important risk of loco-regional and systemic  progression. In case of inoperable disease, we  would have carried out a radical radiotherapy  treatment (with the limits related to the pathol\u0002ogy in exam), also confirming the chosen adju\u0002vant treatment.

Abstract Background: Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is a challenging diagnosis with a particu\u0002larly poor prognosis, even after curative surgery (median survival: <30 months). The prog\u0002nosis of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BR-PDC) is even worse. We describe a  patient with BR-PDC who achieved stable disease with metronomic chemotherapy after  refusing surgery.  Case presentation: A 75-year-old woman was presented with jaundice and epigastric  pain. Imaging confirmed a mass in the pancreatic head encasing the superior mesen\u0002teric vein, with obstruction of the pancreatic and bile ducts. After stenting to relieve the  obstruction, Fine needle aspiration (FNA) confirmed the diagnosis of PDC. The patient  refused surgery and radiation therapy but agreed for chemotherapy. After the second  cycle of mFOLFIRINOX \u2013 complicated by febrile neutropenia \u2013 she refused further  IV therapy. Genomic profiling revealed KIT amplification. Therefore, she was started  on imatinib with dramatic improvement both clinically and biochemically reflected in  carbohydrate antigen 19-9 drop. However, that response was short-lived at 3 months.  Therefore, capecitabine was added at a low dose of 1 g bid on an alternate weekly basis.  The patient did well and she is currently alive with a stable disease as of 2 years after  diagnosis. Conclusion: Metronomic chemotherapy, especially capecitabine added to the targeted  therapy, imatinib, is a potentially useful treatment for PDC where no other options are  available, especially those harbouring no mutation in the dominant four genes. Indeed,  the absence of mutation with KIT amplification could be a potential marker for improved  outcomes with targeted and metronomic therapy, which deserves further evaluation in a  clinical trial setting. Keywords: pancreatic cancer, metronomic chemotherapy, molecular profiling, KIT  amplification Introduction Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is currently one of the leading causes of morbidity and  mortality attributed to cancer worldwide. The rising burden is expected to move it to the  Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 2 second leading cause of worldwide cancer death by 2030 [1]. Most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease [2] where  the mainstay of treatment is systemic chemotherapy [3]. Therefore, the prognosis remains poor with a median 5-year survival rate of just  10%, despite some improvement in therapeutic options [4]. Even those patients presenting with localised PDC who undergo surgery with  or without adjuvant therapy will develop metastatic disease and rarely achieve a disease-free survival (DFS) of more than 2 years. Therefore,  surgery alone is not sufficient for cure, and occult micrometastases are likely to be present at the time of diagnosis. These observations  motivated the adoption of treatment sequencing, which includes neoadjuvant systemic therapy+/\u2212 radiation therapy and the application of  surgery to the population of patients with stable or responding disease, most likely to receive clinical benefit from such large operations [5].  For patients who cannot tolerate or progress on conventional chemotherapy, very few options remain. Radiation therapy is associated with  significant morbidity, especially among the elderly [6]. Advances in precision medicine for PDCs according to the genetics and molecular  biology of this disease are promising approaches to overcome the heterogeneity of different patients and improve survival outcomes for this  poorly prognostic disease. Only 25% harbour actionable molecular alterations, leaving the rest in need of other innovative approaches [7].  Conventional chemotherapy toxicity prompted the development of the concept of metronomic chemotherapy [8]. Metronomic therapy  entails continuous administration of a drug, without long break-off therapy, but at lower doses than those used for conventional schedule  [9]. The metronomic approach is convenient when the goal is to control disease while maintaining the quality of life in a fragile patient [10].  This approach is not yet the standard of care in any tumour despite its popularity; therefore, most aspects of this approach are determined  by the physician according to the patient performance status and the tumour characteristics, including the choice of a chemotherapeutic  agent, the dose and the schedule [11, 12]. Here, we report a case of localised pancreatic adenocarcinoma harbouring KIT amplification, demonstrating an exceptional response to initial  standard chemotherapy, followed by stabilisation on imatinib and capecitabine maintenance. Case report A 75-year-old woman was hospitalised for management of obstructive jaundice and intermittent epigastric pain in August 2020. Contrast\u0002enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, encasing the superior mesenteric vein (Figure 1a and b). Posi\u0002tron emission tomography CT further delineated a mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (size = 4.1 * 3.6 cm; SUV = 18.2) without a clear  boundary with the duodenum. However, no distant metastases were detected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilatation of  the common bile duct, and an EBD tube was placed to drain the bile. The brush biopsy was unremarkable for malignancy. CT-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass was concordant with adenocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable PDC.  The tumour marker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was mildly elevated at 50.3 U/mL. After discussion, the multiple disciplinary teams  recommended induction therapy followed by surgery, but she refused both surgery and radiation therapy and agreed only to chemotherapy.

Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrating the stability of the mass at the head of the pancreas without further progression, or distant metastases.  Chemotherapy was commenced with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin). The first cycle was uneventful, but the  second cycle was complicated by hospital admission for the management of diarrhoea, dehydration and urosepsis. The patient refused any  further intravenous chemotherapy. She was willing, however, to try other oral options. Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy to perform next generation sequencing of the cell-free DNA (Guardant 360 CDX) was  requested. The test detected KIT amplification at a plasma copy number of 2.2. The tumour was microsatellite stable. Given the patient\u2019s willingness to attempt new treatments that could provide her relief and improve her quality of life, treatment with KIT  inhibitor was discussed and agreed to start, which had never been attempted in this population of patients. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibi\u0002tor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA), and c-KIT, was started on a 400-mg daily dosage  [13]. Imatinib was chosen considering its ready availability and reasonable price as compared to other potential targeted therapeutics for  c-KIT. In addition, it is a quite tolerable option. On a follow-up consultation a month after the start of treatment, the patient reported feeling  well, her performance status improved to ECOG 0, and CA19-9 dropped to 7.  Three months after commencing maintenance imatinib (5 months after her initial diagnosis), imaging revealed an excellent ongoing response  with stable disease. However, biochemical progression was evident in rising CA19-9 up to 117, possibly representing a resistant clonal popu\u0002lation. Because she refused intravenous therapy, capecitabine was added to the ongoing imatinib therapy, at a reduced dose of 1 g bid \u00d7 1  week alternating with 1 week break off therapy. An alternate week schedule was used to improve tolerability as the patient developed GII/ III \u2018Hand-Foot syndrome\u2019. Since imatinib was well tolerated, we continued imatinib with capecitabine. Ongoing therapy with imatinib and capecitabine has been well tolerated, and she remains clinically well with excellent PS. CA19-9 dropped  down to 11. Imaging at 16 months after the addition of capecitabine (20 months after her initial diagnosis) has revealed stable disease, with  no metastatic disease on CT imaging (Figure 2). The patient described in this report provided informed written consent for the collection and publication of her deidentified data \u2013 clinical,  molecular and images \u2013 from her medical records. Discussion Systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PDC, an aggressive tumour with a typically advanced presentation [3]. Different regimens,  tailored to the performance status of the patient, are recommended by current guidelines, but none is tailored to the underlying molecular  alterations of the tumour [14]. Hence, the modest palliative effects of conventional chemotherapy, regardless of several cytotoxic drugs are  combined. Usually, this therapy is associated with significant morbidity that negatively affects the quality of life. Even for those with poten\u0002tially resectable disease, the likelihood of successful surgery after induction therapy for patients with resectable, borderline resectable, locally  Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 4 advanced type A, and locally advanced type B disease is approximately 90%, 75%, 60%, and 25%, respectively [5]. Our patient, therefore,  made the decision not to undergo surgery and to get a treatment that does not impair her QoL.  Recently, it has been demonstrated that four frequently mutated genes: KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A (p16) and SMAD4 dominate the genetic  landscape of PDC [15]. The number of mutations among the major four driver genes was substantially associated with OS and DFS [16].  The fewer mutations displayed by PDAC, the better the prognostic outcome in 71 patients who underwent a radical operation followed by  adjuvant chemotherapy, with better OS predicted among those with zero to two mutated genes [17]. Our patient\u2019s tumour displayed no  mutation in any of those genes, consistent with the improved outcome. Response to imatinib was excellent, as predicted by its reported  inhibitory effect in pancreatic cancer cell lines [18]. Overexpression of multiple tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and their ligands has  been described in pancreatic cancer cells, possibly supporting pancreatic cancer cell growth in a redundant manner. Imatinib inhibitory effect  in pancreatic cancer cell lines did not impact growth factor-induced receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation,  possibly contributing to a short-lived response, as observed in our patient [18]. Repeat genomic testing was not attempted as it was too  soon to repeat, within 3 months of therapy; especially since it was expensive and the patient herself was paying for her treatment. Similarly,  mutational analysis was not requested due to the likelihood of low yield, in light of KIT amplification rather than a mutation in the original  specimen.  5-FU has been the cornerstone of treatments for gastrointestinal cancer. There are a number of different treatment schedules in which it is  used in different dose schemes without any definite differences in various non-inferiority studies [19], making the drug an ideal candidate  to be used as metronomic chemotherapy. Another unique advantage is its antiangiogenic properties when administered continuously at low  doses [18]. Therefore, we elected to start capecitabine as metronomic therapy to control the resistant clone/s. We took that approach in  an attempt to reduce adverse events, including financial toxicity, and overcome resistance to conventional therapy [8]. Tolerability has been  demonstrated in clinical trials [20]. Our patient did very well and was able to go on this schedule while maintaining an excellent quality of  life. Metronomic treatment has previously been tested on breast cancer and prostate cancer, but the experience is less in the case of gastro\u0002intestinal cancer. Positive results have been demonstrated in colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, biliary and liver cancer  [10, 11, 21, 22].  Conclusion We report a locally advanced PDC patient who harbours KIT amplification with an exceptional response to targeted and metronomic therapy.  Liquid biopsy was a great asset to offer our patient an option tailored to the particular tumour she has. It revealed the biology of the specific  tumour under care, in light of the aforementioned molecular data [16]. Otherwise, she would have been on supportive care without any  tumour-targeted therapy. The observed efficacy of this approach after first-line therapy draws attention to the importance of incorporat\u0002ing specific molecular characteristics of the tumour when making therapeutic decisions. More importantly, it emphasises the significance of  addressing the heterogeneity of PDC when designing clinical trials as a means to overcome the poor prognosis of PDC and develop subtype\u0002specific recommendations. Indeed, the absence of mutations with KIT amplification could possibly be a marker for improved outcomes with  imatinib and metronomic therapy in patients with PDC. However, this is only one case with interesting clinical activity of the approach that  merits further exploration in a clinical trial setting. In addition, it is a possible strategy when no other option is available. Conflicts of interest None. Funding No funding for this research was obtained from public or private sectors.

Durable effect of imatinib and metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine in pancreatic carcinoma. Ecancer medical science. 2023;17:1535 on 19 May 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Jordan and concerns a 75-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse drug reactions of diarrhoea, dehydration, urosepsis and febrile neutropenia associated with folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The patient was hospitalized for management of obstructive jaundice and intermittent epigastric pain in August 2020. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, encasing the superior mesenteric vein. Positron emission tomography CT further delineated a mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (size = 4.1 * 3.6 cm; SUV = 18.2) without a clear boundary with the duodenum. However, no distant metastases were detected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilatation of the common bile duct, and an EBD tube was placed to drain the bile. The brush biopsy was unremarkable for malignancy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass was concordant with adenocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC). The tumour marker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was mildly elevated at 50.3 U/mL. After discussion, the multiple disciplinary teams recommended induction therapy followed by surgery, but she refused both surgery and radiation therapy and agreed only to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was commenced with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin). The first cycle was uneventful, but the second cycle was complicated by hospital admission for the management of diarrhoea, dehydration and urosepsis. This was also further complicated by febrile neutropenia. The patient refused any further intravenous chemotherapy. She was willing, however, to try other oral options. Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy to perform next generation sequencing of the cell-free DNA (Guardant 360 CDX) was requested. The test detected KIT amplification at a plasma copy number of 2.2. The tumour was microsatellite stable. Given the patient\u2019s willingness to attempt new treatments that could provide her relief and improve her quality of life, treatment with KIT inhibitor was discussed and agreed to start, which had never been attempted in this population of patients. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA), and c-KIT, was started on a 400-mg daily dosage.

Night sweats, fever and weight loss made her visit our hospital. Although levofloxacin failed to resolve her fever, she was suspected of having sepsis because of pancytopenia, ele\u0002vated procalcitonin and a nodular lesion in the lung. After urgent hospitalization, she was diagnosed finally with the methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) asso\u0002ciated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Her general condition was improved with MTX withdrawal and 5-day high-dose glucocorticoid administration. Thus, even when the patient was critically ill with MAS, no cytotoxic agents were required to control MTX-LPD. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 10 February 2023 Accepted 6 May 2023 KEYWORDS Macrophage activation syndrome; methotrexate; lymphoproliferative disease; rheumatoid arthritis; pancytopenia Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that affects the joints primarily and other tissues including the lungs. Methotrexate (MTX) was introduced to the treatment strategy at the end of the twentieth cen\u0002tury, and followed by biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), including anti\u0002tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibodies as the first bDMARD, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) such as Janus kinase inhibi\u0002tors. These drugs have improved the care of the patients and prognosis of the joint function and even the life span [1]. Primarily because of the bal\u0002ance of economical cost and therapeutic efficacy, bDMARDs and tsDMARDs are introduced to the cases not responding properly to MTX. More importantly, they are more effective when used with MTX. Thus, MTX is the key drug and has been the first-choice candidate in the current treatment approach to RA [2]. Nonetheless, MTX has a wide variety of adverse events. While liver damage and myelosuppression are easy-to-manage and dose-dependent, interstitial lung disorders and lymphoproliferative disorders are unpredictable and serious. Especially in Japan, the frequencies of these serious events are high [3]. RA itself is associated with a high incidence of malignant lymphoma even after bDMARDs were introduced to clinics [4]. This fact implies that the development of lymphoproliferative disorders in RA could be attributable not only to chronic inflamma\u0002tion caused by the disease but to immunological abnormalities intrinsic to the disease, genetic factors, aging and immunosenescence. Immunosuppression by therapeutic agents is an additional factor to induce lymphoproliferative disorders. In particular, MTX is involved apparently because swollen lymph nodes that developed under MTX treatment regress after its withdrawal in more than half of the cases [5,6]. Since other immunosuppressive drugs than MTX may be involved, WHO has categorized these disorders into \u201cother iatrogenic immunodeficiency\u0002associated lymphoproliferative disorders\u201d. Patients with malignant lymphoma often develop hemocytopenia. It could be attributable to infiltra\u0002tion of lymphoma cells into the bone marrow, and, in more aggressive status, to hemophagocytic syn\u0002drome (HPS) [7]. It is similar in pathology to the congenital disorders termed hemophagocytic lym\u0002phohistiocytosis, and called lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. Similarly, patients with active autoimmune diseases, including juvenile idio\u0002pathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatomyositis, develop pancytopenia with mul\u0002tiple organ damage. It is called macrophage activa\u0002tion syndrome (MAS) or cytokine storm syndrome [8].

Thus, MAS in patients with active autoimmune diseases is otherwise called auto\u0002immune-associated HPS (AAHS). We report here a case of MAS, who had RA and MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD). Since the RA disease activity of the patient had been controlled properly with MTX, MTX-LPD should have triggered the MAS develop\u0002ment. Although MTX-LPD lesions are undistin\u0002guishable in pathology from those of malignant lymphoma, no report of the MAS associated with MTX-LPD has been published. It is yet to be deter\u0002mined which level of treatment intensity is required to suppress MAS: from MTX withdrawal alone to chemotherapy of LPD with cytotoxic agents. In the case reported here, MTX withdrawal and short-term high-dose glucocorticoid treatment were successful. Case report A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented with knee and finger joint pain and was diagnosed with sero\u0002positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by a local ortho\u0002paedic surgeon at the age of 34. She started taking 8 mg/week of MTX, which improved her joint symptoms. After 17 years, she stopped taking MTX because she had felt no pain for years. Relapse occurred 3 years later, and required 10 mg/week of MTX and salazosulfapyridine (SASP) 1 g/day for suppression. After 2 years of arthritis remission, night sweats and CRP elevation without exacerba\u0002tion of arthritis appeared. Two months later, she had a fever of 38.8 \u0001C, and visited the outpatient office of our hospital for the first time. She had no active arthritis. Because a chest X-ray examination disclosed consolidation in the upper lobe of the left lung, she was diagnosed first with pneumonia. Although she was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg/day for 5 days, her symptoms persisted. The chest CT scan was performed to reveal a nodular lesion in the left lung, multiple swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum and upper abdomen, and splenomegaly. Since blood tests disclosed pancyto\u0002penia, malignant lymphoma was suspected. Three weeks after the first visit, she developed a fever of more than 39 \u0001C, fatigue and respiratory distress, and was urgently admitted to our hospital. She had lost 10 kg during the last 3 months. On admission, her blood test disclosed pancyto\u0002penia and high levels of CRP, ferritin and procalci\u0002tonin. Coagulation and fibrolysis were augmented slightly (Table 1). Because of the pancytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was carried out on the third day of the hospitalization. The smear samples showed no infiltration of atypical cells into the bone marrow, but a few hemophagocytic cells (Figure 1). The biopsy samples showed hypercellular marrow with an increased number of macrophages. No atyp\u0002ical cells were identified. The patient was on antibiotic treatment, because of high fever, leukopenia and the elevated level of procalcitonin, which failed to resolve her fever. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors and ferritin in the sera were elevated to 10,909 U/mL and 1190.3 ng/mL, respectively. Based on the haemato\u0002logical abnormalities including those in the bone marrow, we concluded that she suffered from MAS triggered by MTX-LPD, and withdrew MTX. The clinical stage of the lymphoma was stage IIIB, Table 1. Laboratory date at the time of admission.

KATO ET AL. according to the Ann Arbor classification. The patient had four prognostic factors, based on the International Prognostic Score, suggesting a rela\u0002tively poor prognosis. To prepare for the chemotherapy of LPD, one of the swollen lymph nodes in the abdomen was removed surgically for pathological examination. As for treatment, we were not certain if the MTX with\u0002drawal alone can result in immediate control of MAS. Typically, regression of swollen lymph nodes in MTX-LPD takes a few months. Thus, high-dose glucocorticoid, 100 mg/day of predonisolone, which is a component of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma was administered for 5 days. By the com\u0002pletion of the glucocorticoid treatment, her tempera\u0002ture dropped down to normal. Her general condition improved to let her eat a full meal (Figure 2). In the removed lymph node, massive infiltration of small lymphocytes and histiocytes was observed. Cells with large nucleoli, characteristic of Hodgkin cells, were scattered (Figure 3). According to the subsequent immunohistochemical studies, the final pathological diagnosis was classical Hodgkin lymph\u0002oma (CHL) type among \u201cother iatrogenic immuno\u0002deficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (OI-LPD)\u201d. In addition, dull-positive CD4 cells, which should be macrophages, increased in number. Two days after the completion of the 5-day glucocorticoid treatment, CRP fell below 10 mg/L. The leukocyte and platelet counts recovered. Procalcitonin dropped. After she left our hospital without no subsequent treatments, she had a tem\u0002porary decrease of leukocytes and platelets, which lasted for a month without fever. Soon after normal\u0002ization of the blood cell counts, polyarthritis devel\u0002oped again. A low-dose steroid, prednisolone 5 mg/day, and bucillamine, a non-immunosuppres\u0002sive DMARD, 200 mg/day were started to suppress the joint symptoms. The follow-up CT scan one and three months revealed that the swollen lymph nodes and spleen became smaller. The nodular consolida\u0002tion in the left lung stayed the same, suggesting it was a post-inflammatory change. Discussion This is the first case report of MAS triggered by MTX-LPD. Without the use of cytotoxic agents to suppress the growth of the transformed lympho\u0002cytes, MTX withdrawal and high-dose glucocorticoid administration for a short period of time improved MAS successfully. The abrupt discontinuation of glucocorticoid-induced temporal decrease in the leukocyte and platelet counts unintentionally. These facts demonstrate that quick control of MAS was solely due to glucocorticoid administration. Following long-time control was attributable to the MTX withdrawal. If she had been treated with glucocorticoid pulse treatment and/or longer use of a glucocorticoid, she would not have experienced the temporal exacerbation of MAS. However, with\u0002out the exacerbation, we would not be able to con\u0002clude definitively that glucocorticoid administration alone was effective to suppress MAS. Since gluco\u0002corticoid controlled MAS, we did not have to treat MTX-LPD with cytotoxic agents. Figure 2. The clinical course of the patient. The lower panels show the nodular lesion in the lung (A) and the swollen lymph nodes before treatment (B, C), and the lymph nodes after treatment (D, E). There were no signs and symptoms of arthritis during the course. IMMUNOLOGICAL MEDICINE 3 Glucocorticoids are used as the first-line treat\u0002ment to suppress MAS. If possible, specific treat\u0002ment to address the underlying disorders is combined. We were certain that MTX had to be withdrawn immediately from our patient. Her poor general condition urged us to use glucocorticoids. However, we were uncertain if cytotoxic agents to suppress transformed cells should be combined. Immediately after the lymph node biopsy and thus without knowing precise pathological findings, a haematologist in our team prepared the CHOP regi\u0002men and started its glucocorticoid portion alone: 100 mg prednisolone per day for 5 days. This is due to the fact that the most frequent histological type of MTX-LPD is DLBCL, which is followed by CHL. The glucocorticoid treatment led to the improve\u0002ment of MAS. The final pathological report disclosed that the patient had the CHL type of MTX-LPD. CHL occurs 10\u201311.9% of RA patients who developed MTX-LPD [9,10]. Despite these extensive studies, the frequency of MAS in the CHL type and clinical stage and prognostic score of CHL in MTX-LPD are to be established. MAS secondary to lymphoma is called lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syn\u0002drome (LAHS). M\u0001enard and her colleagues reported that LAHS is rare in patients with B cell lymphomas but has been reported in several patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease [11]. They found that 94% of the cases with Hodgkin\u2019s disease-associated HPS have tumour cells infected by EBV while EBV can be detected in 20\u201340% of the patients in other cohorts of Hodgkin\u2019s disease. It has been postulated that EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) should induce a large number of proinflammatory cytokines. Since the present case was EBV positive in the swollen lymph node, LMP might be responsible for the MAS development. The CHL type is the most significant factor for the relapse of MTX-LPD [9]. Its odds ratio as a risk factor for relapse is 3.81 while that of DLBCL is 0.94. Thus, patients with CHL should be watched more carefully after regression or treatment of LPD. Although no solid evidence is available to justify the use of non-immunosuppressive DMARDs for avoid\u0002ing relapse, it is generally preferred in the actual clinical setting. Pancytopenia in the peripheral blood from patients with lymphoma may be attributable to the infiltration of the tumour cells into the bone mar\u0002row. The bone marrow of the present patient was examined to rule out this possibility. Smear samples of the bone marrow disclosed no infiltration of atypical cells, but hemophagocytic cells. Sepsis is a classic complication of granulocytope\u0002nia and elevates a serum level of procalcitonin. The combination of granulocytopenia, high serum pro\u0002calcitonin level and high-grade fever of the present patient reminded us of sepsis. However, no bacterial infection was found by systemic investigation. The elevated level of procalcitonin persisted during anti\u0002biotic treatment and decreased quickly with the glucocorticoid administration. In this regard, serum procalcitonin level is elevated reportedly in patients Figure 3. Histopathological findings.

KATO ET AL. with MAS/HPS [12,13]. It is thus important to con\u0002sider the possibility of MAS/HPS when a patient has high serum procalcitonin level. MAS is driven by cytokine storm, which also occurs in congenital immune deficient diseases, called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Although there are no widely accepted classification criteria for MAS or secondary HPS, the criteria described in the most recent diagnostic and thera\u0002peutic guidelines of HLH defined by the histiocyte society, HLH-2004, are meant to be applied to HLH with and without the genetic or familial disease [14]. The classification criteria include fever, spleno\u0002megaly, hematopenia, affecting at least two lineages in the peripheral blood, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes. Low or absent NK\u0002cell activity, hyperferritinemia, and high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor were added in the most recent revision. The guideline emphasized the importance of repeat investigation of hemophagocytic activity with serial marrow aspirates since a single bone marrow examination could be inconclusive. The present patient met the criteria. Her hemophago\u0002cytic activity was disclosed by a single bone marrow test. However, hemophagocytic cells are found only in the smear samples of the marrow aspirates. The primary pathology of MAS/secondary HPS is an inflammatory cytokine storm, which is respon\u0002sible for hemophagocytosis. The cytotoxicity of the inflammatory cytokines, rather than hemophagocy\u0002tosis, is responsible for the cytopenia. It has been unclear why intensity of the hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow depends on the patients, raising a question on the legitimacy of the name, HPS. We hope the future basic investigation will clarify the pathology of MAS/secondary HPS. Patient consent Informed consent was obtained from the patient reported in the study.

Abstract Background: Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is a challenging diagnosis with a particu\u0002larly poor prognosis, even after curative surgery (median survival: <30 months). The prog\u0002nosis of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BR-PDC) is even worse. We describe a  patient with BR-PDC who achieved stable disease with metronomic chemotherapy after  refusing surgery.  Case presentation: A 75-year-old woman was presented with jaundice and epigastric  pain. Imaging confirmed a mass in the pancreatic head encasing the superior mesen\u0002teric vein, with obstruction of the pancreatic and bile ducts. After stenting to relieve the  obstruction, Fine needle aspiration (FNA) confirmed the diagnosis of PDC. The patient  refused surgery and radiation therapy but agreed for chemotherapy. After the second  cycle of mFOLFIRINOX \u2013 complicated by febrile neutropenia \u2013 she refused further  IV therapy. Genomic profiling revealed KIT amplification. Therefore, she was started  on imatinib with dramatic improvement both clinically and biochemically reflected in  carbohydrate antigen 19-9 drop. However, that response was short-lived at 3 months.  Therefore, capecitabine was added at a low dose of 1 g bid on an alternate weekly basis.  The patient did well and she is currently alive with a stable disease as of 2 years after  diagnosis. Conclusion: Metronomic chemotherapy, especially capecitabine added to the targeted  therapy, imatinib, is a potentially useful treatment for PDC where no other options are  available, especially those harbouring no mutation in the dominant four genes. Indeed,  the absence of mutation with KIT amplification could be a potential marker for improved  outcomes with targeted and metronomic therapy, which deserves further evaluation in a  clinical trial setting. Keywords: pancreatic cancer, metronomic chemotherapy, molecular profiling, KIT  amplification Introduction Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is currently one of the leading causes of morbidity and  mortality attributed to cancer worldwide. The rising burden is expected to move it to the  Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 2 second leading cause of worldwide cancer death by 2030 [1]. Most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease [2] where  the mainstay of treatment is systemic chemotherapy [3]. Therefore, the prognosis remains poor with a median 5-year survival rate of just  10%, despite some improvement in therapeutic options [4]. Even those patients presenting with localised PDC who undergo surgery with  or without adjuvant therapy will develop metastatic disease and rarely achieve a disease-free survival (DFS) of more than 2 years. Therefore,  surgery alone is not sufficient for cure, and occult micrometastases are likely to be present at the time of diagnosis. These observations  motivated the adoption of treatment sequencing, which includes neoadjuvant systemic therapy+/\u2212 radiation therapy and the application of  surgery to the population of patients with stable or responding disease, most likely to receive clinical benefit from such large operations [5].  For patients who cannot tolerate or progress on conventional chemotherapy, very few options remain. Radiation therapy is associated with  significant morbidity, especially among the elderly [6]. Advances in precision medicine for PDCs according to the genetics and molecular  biology of this disease are promising approaches to overcome the heterogeneity of different patients and improve survival outcomes for this  poorly prognostic disease. Only 25% harbour actionable molecular alterations, leaving the rest in need of other innovative approaches [7].  Conventional chemotherapy toxicity prompted the development of the concept of metronomic chemotherapy [8]. Metronomic therapy  entails continuous administration of a drug, without long break-off therapy, but at lower doses than those used for conventional schedule  [9]. The metronomic approach is convenient when the goal is to control disease while maintaining the quality of life in a fragile patient [10].  This approach is not yet the standard of care in any tumour despite its popularity; therefore, most aspects of this approach are determined  by the physician according to the patient performance status and the tumour characteristics, including the choice of a chemotherapeutic  agent, the dose and the schedule [11, 12]. Here, we report a case of localised pancreatic adenocarcinoma harbouring KIT amplification, demonstrating an exceptional response to initial  standard chemotherapy, followed by stabilisation on imatinib and capecitabine maintenance. Case report A 75-year-old woman was hospitalised for management of obstructive jaundice and intermittent epigastric pain in August 2020. Contrast\u0002enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, encasing the superior mesenteric vein (Figure 1a and b). Posi\u0002tron emission tomography CT further delineated a mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (size = 4.1 * 3.6 cm; SUV = 18.2) without a clear  boundary with the duodenum. However, no distant metastases were detected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilatation of  the common bile duct, and an EBD tube was placed to drain the bile. The brush biopsy was unremarkable for malignancy. CT-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass was concordant with adenocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable PDC.  The tumour marker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was mildly elevated at 50.3 U/mL. After discussion, the multiple disciplinary teams  recommended induction therapy followed by surgery, but she refused both surgery and radiation therapy and agreed only to chemotherapy.

Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrating the stability of the mass at the head of the pancreas without further progression, or distant metastases.  Chemotherapy was commenced with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin). The first cycle was uneventful, but the  second cycle was complicated by hospital admission for the management of diarrhoea, dehydration and urosepsis. The patient refused any  further intravenous chemotherapy. She was willing, however, to try other oral options. Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy to perform next generation sequencing of the cell-free DNA (Guardant 360 CDX) was  requested. The test detected KIT amplification at a plasma copy number of 2.2. The tumour was microsatellite stable. Given the patient\u2019s willingness to attempt new treatments that could provide her relief and improve her quality of life, treatment with KIT  inhibitor was discussed and agreed to start, which had never been attempted in this population of patients. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibi\u0002tor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA), and c-KIT, was started on a 400-mg daily dosage  [13]. Imatinib was chosen considering its ready availability and reasonable price as compared to other potential targeted therapeutics for  c-KIT. In addition, it is a quite tolerable option. On a follow-up consultation a month after the start of treatment, the patient reported feeling  well, her performance status improved to ECOG 0, and CA19-9 dropped to 7.  Three months after commencing maintenance imatinib (5 months after her initial diagnosis), imaging revealed an excellent ongoing response  with stable disease. However, biochemical progression was evident in rising CA19-9 up to 117, possibly representing a resistant clonal popu\u0002lation. Because she refused intravenous therapy, capecitabine was added to the ongoing imatinib therapy, at a reduced dose of 1 g bid \u00d7 1  week alternating with 1 week break off therapy. An alternate week schedule was used to improve tolerability as the patient developed GII/ III \u2018Hand-Foot syndrome\u2019. Since imatinib was well tolerated, we continued imatinib with capecitabine. Ongoing therapy with imatinib and capecitabine has been well tolerated, and she remains clinically well with excellent PS. CA19-9 dropped  down to 11. Imaging at 16 months after the addition of capecitabine (20 months after her initial diagnosis) has revealed stable disease, with  no metastatic disease on CT imaging (Figure 2). The patient described in this report provided informed written consent for the collection and publication of her deidentified data \u2013 clinical,  molecular and images \u2013 from her medical records. Discussion Systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PDC, an aggressive tumour with a typically advanced presentation [3]. Different regimens,  tailored to the performance status of the patient, are recommended by current guidelines, but none is tailored to the underlying molecular  alterations of the tumour [14]. Hence, the modest palliative effects of conventional chemotherapy, regardless of several cytotoxic drugs are  combined. Usually, this therapy is associated with significant morbidity that negatively affects the quality of life. Even for those with poten\u0002tially resectable disease, the likelihood of successful surgery after induction therapy for patients with resectable, borderline resectable, locally  Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 4 advanced type A, and locally advanced type B disease is approximately 90%, 75%, 60%, and 25%, respectively [5]. Our patient, therefore,  made the decision not to undergo surgery and to get a treatment that does not impair her QoL.  Recently, it has been demonstrated that four frequently mutated genes: KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A (p16) and SMAD4 dominate the genetic  landscape of PDC [15]. The number of mutations among the major four driver genes was substantially associated with OS and DFS [16].  The fewer mutations displayed by PDAC, the better the prognostic outcome in 71 patients who underwent a radical operation followed by  adjuvant chemotherapy, with better OS predicted among those with zero to two mutated genes [17]. Our patient\u2019s tumour displayed no  mutation in any of those genes, consistent with the improved outcome. Response to imatinib was excellent, as predicted by its reported  inhibitory effect in pancreatic cancer cell lines [18]. Overexpression of multiple tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and their ligands has  been described in pancreatic cancer cells, possibly supporting pancreatic cancer cell growth in a redundant manner. Imatinib inhibitory effect  in pancreatic cancer cell lines did not impact growth factor-induced receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation,  possibly contributing to a short-lived response, as observed in our patient [18]. Repeat genomic testing was not attempted as it was too  soon to repeat, within 3 months of therapy; especially since it was expensive and the patient herself was paying for her treatment. Similarly,  mutational analysis was not requested due to the likelihood of low yield, in light of KIT amplification rather than a mutation in the original  specimen.  5-FU has been the cornerstone of treatments for gastrointestinal cancer. There are a number of different treatment schedules in which it is  used in different dose schemes without any definite differences in various non-inferiority studies [19], making the drug an ideal candidate  to be used as metronomic chemotherapy. Another unique advantage is its antiangiogenic properties when administered continuously at low  doses [18]. Therefore, we elected to start capecitabine as metronomic therapy to control the resistant clone/s. We took that approach in  an attempt to reduce adverse events, including financial toxicity, and overcome resistance to conventional therapy [8]. Tolerability has been  demonstrated in clinical trials [20]. Our patient did very well and was able to go on this schedule while maintaining an excellent quality of  life. Metronomic treatment has previously been tested on breast cancer and prostate cancer, but the experience is less in the case of gastro\u0002intestinal cancer. Positive results have been demonstrated in colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, biliary and liver cancer  [10, 11, 21, 22].  Conclusion We report a locally advanced PDC patient who harbours KIT amplification with an exceptional response to targeted and metronomic therapy.  Liquid biopsy was a great asset to offer our patient an option tailored to the particular tumour she has. It revealed the biology of the specific  tumour under care, in light of the aforementioned molecular data [16]. Otherwise, she would have been on supportive care without any  tumour-targeted therapy. The observed efficacy of this approach after first-line therapy draws attention to the importance of incorporat\u0002ing specific molecular characteristics of the tumour when making therapeutic decisions. More importantly, it emphasises the significance of  addressing the heterogeneity of PDC when designing clinical trials as a means to overcome the poor prognosis of PDC and develop subtype\u0002specific recommendations. Indeed, the absence of mutations with KIT amplification could possibly be a marker for improved outcomes with  imatinib and metronomic therapy in patients with PDC. However, this is only one case with interesting clinical activity of the approach that  merits further exploration in a clinical trial setting. In addition, it is a possible strategy when no other option is available. Conflicts of interest None. Funding No funding for this research was obtained from public or private sectors.

Durable effect of imatinib and metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine in pancreatic carcinoma. Ecancer medical science. 2023;17:1535 on 19 May 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Jordan and concerns a 75-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse drug reactions of diarrhoea, dehydration, urosepsis and febrile neutropenia associated with folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The patient was hospitalized for management of obstructive jaundice and intermittent epigastric pain in August 2020. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, encasing the superior mesenteric vein. Positron emission tomography CT further delineated a mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (size = 4.1 * 3.6 cm; SUV = 18.2) without a clear boundary with the duodenum. However, no distant metastases were detected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilatation of the common bile duct, and an EBD tube was placed to drain the bile. The brush biopsy was unremarkable for malignancy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass was concordant with adenocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC). The tumour marker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was mildly elevated at 50.3 U/mL. After discussion, the multiple disciplinary teams recommended induction therapy followed by surgery, but she refused both surgery and radiation therapy and agreed only to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was commenced with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin). The first cycle was uneventful, but the second cycle was complicated by hospital admission for the management of diarrhoea, dehydration and urosepsis. This was also further complicated by febrile neutropenia. The patient refused any further intravenous chemotherapy. She was willing, however, to try other oral options. Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy to perform next generation sequencing of the cell-free DNA (Guardant 360 CDX) was requested. The test detected KIT amplification at a plasma copy number of 2.2. The tumour was microsatellite stable. Given the patient\u2019s willingness to attempt new treatments that could provide her relief and improve her quality of life, treatment with KIT inhibitor was discussed and agreed to start, which had never been attempted in this population of patients. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA), and c-KIT, was started on a 400-mg daily dosage. Imatinib was chosen considering its ready availability and reasonable price as compared to other potential targeted therapeutics for c-KIT. In addition, it is a quite tolerable option. On a follow-up consultation a month after the start of treatment, the patient reported feeling well, her performance status improved to ECOG 0, and CA19-9 dropped to 7. Three months after commencing maintenance imatinib (5 months after her initial diagnosis), imaging revealed an excellent ongoing response with stable disease. However, biochemical progression was evident in rising CA19-9 up to 117, possibly representing a resistant clonal population. Because she refused intravenous therapy, capecitabine was added to the ongoing imatinib therapy, at a reduced dose of 1 g bid \u00d7 1 week alternating with 1 week break off therapy. An alternate week schedule was used to improve tolerability as the patient developed GII/III \u2018Hand-Foot syndrome\u2019 (Also refer linked case # JO-MLMSERVICE-20230523-4302043-1). Since imatinib was well tolerated, we continued imatinib with capecitabine. Ongoing therapy with imatinib and capecitabine has been well tolerated, and she remains clinically well with excellent PS.

Night sweats, fever and weight loss made her visit our hospital. Although levofloxacin failed to resolve her fever, she was suspected of having sepsis because of pancytopenia, ele\u0002vated procalcitonin and a nodular lesion in the lung. After urgent hospitalization, she was diagnosed finally with the methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) asso\u0002ciated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Her general condition was improved with MTX withdrawal and 5-day high-dose glucocorticoid administration. Thus, even when the patient was critically ill with MAS, no cytotoxic agents were required to control MTX-LPD. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 10 February 2023 Accepted 6 May 2023 KEYWORDS Macrophage activation syndrome; methotrexate; lymphoproliferative disease; rheumatoid arthritis; pancytopenia Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease that affects the joints primarily and other tissues including the lungs. Methotrexate (MTX) was introduced to the treatment strategy at the end of the twentieth cen\u0002tury, and followed by biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), including anti\u0002tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibodies as the first bDMARD, and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) such as Janus kinase inhibi\u0002tors. These drugs have improved the care of the patients and prognosis of the joint function and even the life span [1]. Primarily because of the bal\u0002ance of economical cost and therapeutic efficacy, bDMARDs and tsDMARDs are introduced to the cases not responding properly to MTX. More importantly, they are more effective when used with MTX. Thus, MTX is the key drug and has been the first-choice candidate in the current treatment approach to RA [2]. Nonetheless, MTX has a wide variety of adverse events. While liver damage and myelosuppression are easy-to-manage and dose-dependent, interstitial lung disorders and lymphoproliferative disorders are unpredictable and serious. Especially in Japan, the frequencies of these serious events are high [3]. RA itself is associated with a high incidence of malignant lymphoma even after bDMARDs were introduced to clinics [4]. This fact implies that the development of lymphoproliferative disorders in RA could be attributable not only to chronic inflamma\u0002tion caused by the disease but to immunological abnormalities intrinsic to the disease, genetic factors, aging and immunosenescence. Immunosuppression by therapeutic agents is an additional factor to induce lymphoproliferative disorders. In particular, MTX is involved apparently because swollen lymph nodes that developed under MTX treatment regress after its withdrawal in more than half of the cases [5,6]. Since other immunosuppressive drugs than MTX may be involved, WHO has categorized these disorders into \u201cother iatrogenic immunodeficiency\u0002associated lymphoproliferative disorders\u201d. Patients with malignant lymphoma often develop hemocytopenia. It could be attributable to infiltra\u0002tion of lymphoma cells into the bone marrow, and, in more aggressive status, to hemophagocytic syn\u0002drome (HPS) [7]. It is similar in pathology to the congenital disorders termed hemophagocytic lym\u0002phohistiocytosis, and called lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome. Similarly, patients with active autoimmune diseases, including juvenile idio\u0002pathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatomyositis, develop pancytopenia with mul\u0002tiple organ damage. It is called macrophage activa\u0002tion syndrome (MAS) or cytokine storm syndrome [8].

IMMUNOLOGICAL MEDICINE https://doi.org/10.1080/25785826.2023.2212808 macrophages and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, MAS and HPS should be essentially in the same disease spectrum. Thus, MAS in patients with active autoimmune diseases is otherwise called auto\u0002immune-associated HPS (AAHS). We report here a case of MAS, who had RA and MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD). Since the RA disease activity of the patient had been controlled properly with MTX, MTX-LPD should have triggered the MAS develop\u0002ment. Although MTX-LPD lesions are undistin\u0002guishable in pathology from those of malignant lymphoma, no report of the MAS associated with MTX-LPD has been published. It is yet to be deter\u0002mined which level of treatment intensity is required to suppress MAS: from MTX withdrawal alone to chemotherapy of LPD with cytotoxic agents. In the case reported here, MTX withdrawal and short-term high-dose glucocorticoid treatment were successful. Case report A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented with knee and finger joint pain and was diagnosed with sero\u0002positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by a local ortho\u0002paedic surgeon at the age of 34. She started taking 8 mg/week of MTX, which improved her joint symptoms. After 17 years, she stopped taking MTX because she had felt no pain for years. Relapse occurred 3 years later, and required 10 mg/week of MTX and salazosulfapyridine (SASP) 1 g/day for suppression. After 2 years of arthritis remission, night sweats and CRP elevation without exacerba\u0002tion of arthritis appeared. Two months later, she had a fever of 38.8 \u0001C, and visited the outpatient office of our hospital for the first time. She had no active arthritis. Because a chest X-ray examination disclosed consolidation in the upper lobe of the left lung, she was diagnosed first with pneumonia. Although she was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg/day for 5 days, her symptoms persisted. The chest CT scan was performed to reveal a nodular lesion in the left lung, multiple swollen lymph nodes in the mediastinum and upper abdomen, and splenomegaly. Since blood tests disclosed pancyto\u0002penia, malignant lymphoma was suspected. Three weeks after the first visit, she developed a fever of more than 39 \u0001C, fatigue and respiratory distress, and was urgently admitted to our hospital. She had lost 10 kg during the last 3 months. On admission, her blood test disclosed pancyto\u0002penia and high levels of CRP, ferritin and procalci\u0002tonin. Coagulation and fibrolysis were augmented slightly (Table 1). Because of the pancytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was carried out on the third day of the hospitalization. The smear samples showed no infiltration of atypical cells into the bone marrow, but a few hemophagocytic cells (Figure 1). The biopsy samples showed hypercellular marrow with an increased number of macrophages. No atyp\u0002ical cells were identified. The patient was on antibiotic treatment, because of high fever, leukopenia and the elevated level of procalcitonin, which failed to resolve her fever. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors and ferritin in the sera were elevated to 10,909 U/mL and 1190.3 ng/mL, respectively. Based on the haemato\u0002logical abnormalities including those in the bone marrow, we concluded that she suffered from MAS triggered by MTX-LPD, and withdrew MTX. The clinical stage of the lymphoma was stage IIIB, Table 1. Laboratory date at the time of admission.

KATO ET AL. according to the Ann Arbor classification. The patient had four prognostic factors, based on the International Prognostic Score, suggesting a rela\u0002tively poor prognosis. To prepare for the chemotherapy of LPD, one of the swollen lymph nodes in the abdomen was removed surgically for pathological examination. As for treatment, we were not certain if the MTX with\u0002drawal alone can result in immediate control of MAS. Typically, regression of swollen lymph nodes in MTX-LPD takes a few months. Thus, high-dose glucocorticoid, 100 mg/day of predonisolone, which is a component of chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma was administered for 5 days. By the com\u0002pletion of the glucocorticoid treatment, her tempera\u0002ture dropped down to normal. Her general condition improved to let her eat a full meal (Figure 2). In the removed lymph node, massive infiltration of small lymphocytes and histiocytes was observed. Cells with large nucleoli, characteristic of Hodgkin cells, were scattered (Figure 3). According to the subsequent immunohistochemical studies, the final pathological diagnosis was classical Hodgkin lymph\u0002oma (CHL) type among \u201cother iatrogenic immuno\u0002deficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (OI-LPD)\u201d. In addition, dull-positive CD4 cells, which should be macrophages, increased in number. Two days after the completion of the 5-day glucocorticoid treatment, CRP fell below 10 mg/L. The leukocyte and platelet counts recovered. Procalcitonin dropped. After she left our hospital without no subsequent treatments, she had a tem\u0002porary decrease of leukocytes and platelets, which lasted for a month without fever. Soon after normal\u0002ization of the blood cell counts, polyarthritis devel\u0002oped again. A low-dose steroid, prednisolone 5 mg/day, and bucillamine, a non-immunosuppres\u0002sive DMARD, 200 mg/day were started to suppress the joint symptoms. The follow-up CT scan one and three months revealed that the swollen lymph nodes and spleen became smaller. The nodular consolida\u0002tion in the left lung stayed the same, suggesting it was a post-inflammatory change. Discussion This is the first case report of MAS triggered by MTX-LPD. Without the use of cytotoxic agents to suppress the growth of the transformed lympho\u0002cytes, MTX withdrawal and high-dose glucocorticoid administration for a short period of time improved MAS successfully. The abrupt discontinuation of glucocorticoid-induced temporal decrease in the leukocyte and platelet counts unintentionally. These facts demonstrate that quick control of MAS was solely due to glucocorticoid administration. Following long-time control was attributable to the MTX withdrawal. If she had been treated with glucocorticoid pulse treatment and/or longer use of a glucocorticoid, she would not have experienced the temporal exacerbation of MAS. However, with\u0002out the exacerbation, we would not be able to con\u0002clude definitively that glucocorticoid administration alone was effective to suppress MAS. Since gluco\u0002corticoid controlled MAS, we did not have to treat MTX-LPD with cytotoxic agents. Figure 2. The clinical course of the patient. The lower panels show the nodular lesion in the lung (A) and the swollen lymph nodes before treatment (B, C), and the lymph nodes after treatment (D, E). There were no signs and symptoms of arthritis during the course. IMMUNOLOGICAL MEDICINE 3 Glucocorticoids are used as the first-line treat\u0002ment to suppress MAS. If possible, specific treat\u0002ment to address the underlying disorders is combined. We were certain that MTX had to be withdrawn immediately from our patient. Her poor general condition urged us to use glucocorticoids. However, we were uncertain if cytotoxic agents to suppress transformed cells should be combined. Immediately after the lymph node biopsy and thus without knowing precise pathological findings, a haematologist in our team prepared the CHOP regi\u0002men and started its glucocorticoid portion alone: 100 mg prednisolone per day for 5 days. This is due to the fact that the most frequent histological type of MTX-LPD is DLBCL, which is followed by CHL. The glucocorticoid treatment led to the improve\u0002ment of MAS. The final pathological report disclosed that the patient had the CHL type of MTX-LPD. CHL occurs 10\u201311.9% of RA patients who developed MTX-LPD [9,10]. Despite these extensive studies, the frequency of MAS in the CHL type and clinical stage and prognostic score of CHL in MTX-LPD are to be established. MAS secondary to lymphoma is called lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syn\u0002drome (LAHS). M\u0001enard and her colleagues reported that LAHS is rare in patients with B cell lymphomas but has been reported in several patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease [11]. They found that 94% of the cases with Hodgkin\u2019s disease-associated HPS have tumour cells infected by EBV while EBV can be detected in 20\u201340% of the patients in other cohorts of Hodgkin\u2019s disease. It has been postulated that EBV latent membrane protein (LMP) should induce a large number of proinflammatory cytokines. Since the present case was EBV positive in the swollen lymph node, LMP might be responsible for the MAS development. The CHL type is the most significant factor for the relapse of MTX-LPD [9]. Its odds ratio as a risk factor for relapse is 3.81 while that of DLBCL is 0.94. Thus, patients with CHL should be watched more carefully after regression or treatment of LPD. Although no solid evidence is available to justify the use of non-immunosuppressive DMARDs for avoid\u0002ing relapse, it is generally preferred in the actual clinical setting. Pancytopenia in the peripheral blood from patients with lymphoma may be attributable to the infiltration of the tumour cells into the bone mar\u0002row. The bone marrow of the present patient was examined to rule out this possibility. Smear samples of the bone marrow disclosed no infiltration of atypical cells, but hemophagocytic cells. Sepsis is a classic complication of granulocytope\u0002nia and elevates a serum level of procalcitonin. The combination of granulocytopenia, high serum pro\u0002calcitonin level and high-grade fever of the present patient reminded us of sepsis. However, no bacterial infection was found by systemic investigation. The elevated level of procalcitonin persisted during anti\u0002biotic treatment and decreased quickly with the glucocorticoid administration. In this regard, serum procalcitonin level is elevated reportedly in patients Figure 3. Histopathological findings.

KATO ET AL. with MAS/HPS [12,13]. It is thus important to con\u0002sider the possibility of MAS/HPS when a patient has high serum procalcitonin level. MAS is driven by cytokine storm, which also occurs in congenital immune deficient diseases, called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Although there are no widely accepted classification criteria for MAS or secondary HPS, the criteria described in the most recent diagnostic and thera\u0002peutic guidelines of HLH defined by the histiocyte society, HLH-2004, are meant to be applied to HLH with and without the genetic or familial disease [14]. The classification criteria include fever, spleno\u0002megaly, hematopenia, affecting at least two lineages in the peripheral blood, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes. Low or absent NK\u0002cell activity, hyperferritinemia, and high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor were added in the most recent revision. The guideline emphasized the importance of repeat investigation of hemophagocytic activity with serial marrow aspirates since a single bone marrow examination could be inconclusive. The present patient met the criteria. Her hemophago\u0002cytic activity was disclosed by a single bone marrow test. However, hemophagocytic cells are found only in the smear samples of the marrow aspirates. The primary pathology of MAS/secondary HPS is an inflammatory cytokine storm, which is respon\u0002sible for hemophagocytosis. The cytotoxicity of the inflammatory cytokines, rather than hemophagocy\u0002tosis, is responsible for the cytopenia. It has been unclear why intensity of the hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow depends on the patients, raising a question on the legitimacy of the name, HPS. We hope the future basic investigation will clarify the pathology of MAS/secondary HPS. Patient consent Informed consent was obtained from the patient reported in the study.

Initial and Follow-up information have been processed together. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United Kingdom and concerns a 62-year-old female patient (Case three) who experienced a non-serious adverse reaction of osteopenia (t score -1.8 at lumbar spine) associated with prednisolone. The patient was diagnosed with atopic eosinophilic adult-onset asthma in the late 1980s and seropositive RA in 2012. Prior therapy for asthma included a combination of bronchodilators and steroid inhalers. She was referred to the severe asthma service in 2018, and omalizumab was commenced in June 2019. Since starting this, her asthma has been well controlled, supported by clinical examination and ACQ-6 score (asthma control questionnaire). Initially, her RA was treated with MTX and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). However, despite this combination, she had evidence of ongoing joint inflammation, and in 2018 she was started on etanercept. She has continued both biologics for 36 months with good control of asthma and RA, without any serious adverse events, and has not required any steroid therapy. This was confirmed by reviewing the omalizumab record sheet.

There are limited data available on this approach, and concerns remain about the possible risk of adverse events, particularly infection. Methods: We present three patients on dual biologics for rheumatic disease and asthma. The biologic combinations used were etanercept and mepolizumab, infliximab and omalizumab, and etanercept and omalizumab. The time on combination biologic therapies ranged from 24 to 36 months. Patients were monitored for any serious adverse events. Results: All three patients were able to tolerate combined biologic therapies, with no serious adverse events. All three patients gained improve\u0002ment in their rheumatic and asthma disease control, with reduction in disease activity scores and reduction in steroid usage. Conclusion: The decision to start dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis. The number of patients who are on combination biological therapy is small, and data are sparse. Real-world data are needed to examine the long-term benefits and risks of differ\u0002ent forms of combination biologic therapies. Lay Summary What does this mean for patients? Biological therapies are specific therapies that target particular parts of the immune system. These medications are used in the treatment of au\u0002toimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In RA, they work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood from activating the im\u0002mune system to attack joints. They are very effective medications to treat inflammatory autoimmune conditions. In some cases, they can be as\u0002sociated with side effects, particularly increased risk of infections. We have written a case series about three people who have inflammatory autoimmune conditions and are receiving two biologics to treat these. All three people have inflammatory arthritis and asthma and are receiving two different biological therapies. They have been receiving these for a period ranging from 24 to 36 months. All three people have been able to tolerate combined biologic therapies, with no serious adverse events thus far. They have gained improvement in their arthritis and asthma con\u0002trol, with reduction in disease activity and the use of steroids. Although the number of people receiving more than one biological treatment is small, this study suggests that dual therapy could be used in certain situations. The decision to start dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis, by the specialists. Keywords: rheumatic disease, asthma, immunosuppressants, biological therapies, infections and arthritis, quality of life, etanercept, mepolizumab, infliximab, omalizumab Introduction Combination biological therapies are being considered in\u0002creasingly for the treatment of patients who present with mul\u0002tiple co-morbidities requiring biological treatment. There are limited data available regarding this, and concerns remain about the risk of adverse events, particularly infections, in ad\u0002dition to potential drug interactions in patients receiving more than one biological therapy [1]. We present a case series of three patients who have benefited from dual biologic therapy for rheumatic disease and asthma. Key messages \u2022 Combination biological therapies are being considered increasingly for patients who present with multiple co-morbidities. \u2022 Data presented here suggest that combination biologics can be used safely, without serious adverse events. \u2022 The decision to start dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis.

Rheumatology Advances in Practice, 2023, 7(1), rkad018 https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkad018 Advance access publication 3 February 2023 Concise Report Rheumatology Advances in Practice Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/7/1/rkad018/7025501 by guest on 19 July 2023 Literature on dual biologic therapy is limited, owing to the infrequency of this clinical approach. There are significant clinical reservations in taking this approach owing to the po\u0002tential risk of serious infection from immunosuppression [1]. In addition, the wide variety of biological therapies and their potential combinations makes consistent comparison of out\u0002comes difficult, and structured clinical trials are infrequent. Development of newer agents targeting different pathways has made it possible to use combination therapy in selected patients. Simultaneous use of more than one biological agent has been used in two main scenarios: patients with severe in\u0002flammatory disease unresponsive to a single biological agent, or patients with co-existing severe medical conditions, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease [2\u20134], asthma [5, 6] and psoria\u0002sis [7]. There is limited real world evidence from case-based literature on combining biological therapies across different clinical specialties. Methods We present three cases illustrating the outcome of combina\u0002tion therapy for severe asthma and inflammatory arthritis. Formal ethics approval was not required for this work be\u0002cause only anonymized patient information was included and no change to patients\u2019 standard care was required in order to be included in the case series. All patients gave written in\u0002formed consent to the use of their data. A summary of the clinical presentations and therapies can be found in Table 1. Etanercept and infliximab are anti-TNF-a agents licensed for the treatment of moderate or severe RA [8]. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE biologic used for the treatment of atopic asthma [9]. Mepolizumab is an anti-IL-5 agent used for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. We have defined serious adverse events in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration definition [10]. A seri\u0002ous adverse event is an undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product, which is life threatening, can re\u0002sult in death, hospitalization, disability, permanent damage or congenital anomaly. This also includes other serious events, such as allergic bronchospasm, serious blood dyscrasias or seizures. We have also included transaminitis and infections requiring antibiotics. Information was gathered by reviewing medical notes at the tertiary centre, the local hospital, from general practitioner records and by contacting patients. Case one Case one is a 56-year-old woman with severe eosinophilic asthma diagnosed in the late 1990s and seronegative RA diag\u0002nosed in 2019. Her asthma was previously treated with bronchodilator and steroid inhalers, montelukast and daily maintenance prednisolone. Mepolizumab was commenced in 2018, and since then she has reported no exacerbations of her asthma. Mid-2022, she was reviewed by the asthma service and was tolerating mepolizumab well, was no longer on mon\u0002telukast or the steroid inhaler, and had not had to use her sal\u0002butamol inhaler for \u00027 months. For RA, she was initially treated with sulphasalazine (SSZ), but this was not tolerated and was stopped. She commenced methotrexate (MTX) 20 mg s.c. once weekly along with pred\u0002nisolone in early 2020, but after 6 months remained symp\u0002tomatic, with evidence of active synovitis on musculoskeletal ultrasound (US), despite being on prednisolone 25 mg daily. At this time, her disease activity score (DAS28) was 6.25. Etanercept was then commenced alongside MTX and pred\u0002nisolone. Twenty-four months after commencing etanercept, she continues etanercept and has reduced her prednisolone to 11 mg daily. Her DAS is 2.27. It has been difficult to reduce her prednisolone further thus far owing to ongoing joint pain, although there is no synovitis on US. She is being encouraged to reduce the corticosteroids (CS) dose gradually. She has been on dual therapy for 24 months and has not had any recorded serious adverse events. Case two Case two is a 35-year-old man, known to have asthma since childhood, requiring multiple hospital admissions and an in\u0002tensive care unit admission in 2002. He has previously been on a combination of inhalers, aminophylline and montelu\u0002kast, but still required frequent courses of oral CSs. He was diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease in 2006 and was subsequently diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s-associated arthritis, for which he has been on azathioprine (AZA) and infliximab since 2008. In April 2019 he was started on omalizumab for severe asthma that was difficult to control. On follow-up, he reported signif\u0002icant improvement in asthma symptoms, with no further need for oral CSs, and he no longer requires nebulized therapy. He continues infliximab at the same dose and omalizumab and has achieved good control of his Crohn\u2019s disease and associ\u0002ated arthritis. He has not experienced any serious adverse effects after 36 months of combination therapy. Case three Case three is a 62-year-old woman who was diagnosed with atopic eosinophilic adult-onset asthma in the late 1980s and seropositive RA in 2012. Prior therapy for asthma included a combination of bronchodilator and steroid inhalers. She was referred to the severe asthma service in 2018, and Table 1.

Since starting this, her asthma has been well controlled, supported by clini\u0002cal examination and ACQ-6 score (asthma control question\u0002naire). Initially, her RA was treated with MTX and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). However, despite this combina\u0002tion she had evidence of ongoing joint inflammation, and in 2018 she was started on etanercept. She has continued both biologics for 36 months with good control of asthma and RA, without any serious adverse events, and has not required any steroid therapy. This was confirmed by reviewing the omali\u0002zumab record sheet. Results In these three cases, dual biologic therapy has been used to good effect, with no infection or other serious adverse events. This has also enabled patients to reduce oral CS dependence significantly, with the added benefit of minimizing CS-related adverse effects. Discussion The decision to start a patient on dual biologic therapy should be considered carefully, on a case-by-case basis, only when conventional treatment options have failed and in the context of life-threatening or significantly disabling disease. The main concerns regarding the use of dual biologic therapy centre around safety, especially a theoretical risk of serious infec\u0002tions [1]; no infections were seen in this small case series. This potential risk must be balanced carefully against the potential long-term harm from ongoing severe disease and the well\u0002documented risks associated with other adjuvant therapies, specifically CSs, which would be the most likely alternative treatment option in this group of difficult-to-treat patients. The number of patients requiring combination biological therapies is a small but important group. Data are sparse, be\u0002cause they are generally excluded from clinical trials. Thus, real-world data are important and needed to examine the long-term benefits and risks of different forms of combination biologic therapies across different disease areas.

Serotonin Syndrome with Monotherapy of Low-Dose Sertraline in an Adult Patient with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Case Reports in Psychiatry. 2023;2023:6610152 on 30 Jun 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United States of America and concerns a 32-year-old male patient who experienced a serious adverse reaction of serotonin syndrome associated with sertraline. The patient with a history of high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (living independently), depression, hypertension, and acid reflux disease was presented. Collateral information from the father confirmed a diagnosis of ASD that was based on detailed neuropsychological testing in childhood. His home medications included losartan 100 mg daily, famotidine 20 mg daily, and sertraline 50 mg daily. Patient shared that he was started on sertraline for his depressive symptoms 4 days ago, and he had taken his 4th dose that morning. He denied any previous history of antidepressant medication use. On the fourth day of sertraline 50 mg dosing, he presented himself to the emergency department (ED) during evening hours with complaints of restlessness and diffuse muscle stiffness; he felt his legs were \u201cstiff and heavy,\u201d and he \u201ccouldn\u2019t really move them\u201d and also described \u201ctoes retching turning inwards\u201d with an unusual but not painful sensation. On physical examination, he was noted to have bilateral upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus with lateral eye movement, and inducible clonus in his right ankle. Cranial nerve exams II-XII were normal, and deep tendon reflexes were not commented upon, so it is unclear if they were examined or not. Vital signs are notable for a heart rate of 61, blood pressure of 164/94, and oxygen saturation of 98% at room air. Routine lab work showed a normal complete blood count (CBC) with differential comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that was unremarkable other than mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mEq/L. Urine drug screen was negative for any substances. Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) and urinalysis were normal. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with QTc of 403. He was diagnosed with Serotonin Syndrome (SS) using Hunter\u2019s criteria given both inducible and ocular clonus, with restless agitation and tremor. Other diagnoses (anticholinergic toxicity, intoxication from sympathomimetic agents, withdrawal from sedative-hypnotic, thyroid storm, and acute extrapyramidal syndromes) were ruled out as the patient denied taking any other medications or antipsychotic, illicit substances, or supplements on the day of presentation to the ER or before. There are no known drug interactions with the use of sertraline with losartan and famotidine. He received IV fluids with repletion of potassium for mild hypokalemia and IV lorazepam 1 mg with a resolution of symptoms by the next morning and was discharged home with the recommendation to stop taking sertraline. A score of 7 (probable) was obtained using the Naranjo algorithm\u2014adverse drug reaction probability scale to assess for adverse drug reaction. Similarly, the WHO-UMC causality assessment system also suggested a probable/likely adverse drug reaction. Serotonin syndrome, also known as serotonin toxicity, is associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central and the peripheral nervous system. The symptoms can range from mild to potentially life threatening. The patient was diagnosed with ASD in childhood is one of the first cases of SS in this population. It is interesting to note that 25% of patients with ASD have hyperserotonergic activity, which is considered as one of the earliest biomarkers in these patients. This could likely be a risk factor for monotherapy-related SS in patients with comorbid ASD. Cases of SS from SSRI monotherapy usually present with mild to moderate severity and, therefore, are not easily suspected. Hunter\u2019s criteria are considered to be the most accurate to diagnose early, mild, or subacute forms. The patient\u2019s symptoms resolved within 24 hours with intravenous fluids, lorazepam, and discontinuation of sertraline. The case report highlighted the importance of SS even in patients on SSRI monotherapy taking therapeutic dosages. It particularly emphasizes the significance of keeping a high degree of suspicion for SS in ASD patients as some of them may have baseline hyper serotonergic state. Early diagnosis and discontinuation of the serotonergic agent along with supportive management is the most effective treatment of this syndrome. Follow-up information has been requested. Follow-up received on 08 Jul 2023: Additional information added following receipt of author\u2019s response. The patient was average weight for his height. Serotonin syndrome resolved about 24 hours after culprit medication was stopped and IV fluids along with Lorazepam was given. Route of administration of sertraline was oral. The patient was not rechallenged with sertraline. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol use.

Serotonin syndrome, also known as serotonin toxicity, is associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central and the peripheral nervous system. The symptoms can range from mild to potentially life threatening. Given the widespread use of serotonergic agents, the number of cases is on the rise. It is seen with therapeutic medication use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, and intentional self-poisoning, but still known cases with monotherapy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are uncommon. Another known fact is that elevated whole blood serotonin, or hyperserotonemia, is one of the first biomarkers identified in autism spectrum disorder and is present in more than 25% of affected children. We present a case of a 32-year-old male with a history of autism spectrum disorder and depressive disorder who presented to the emergency department with restless agitation, neuromuscular excitability, and autonomic instability. He had been prescribed sertraline 50 mg which he had taken daily as prescribed for 4 days. On the fourth day, he presented to the emergency department with diffuse muscle stiffness, upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus, and inducible ankle clonus. He was diagnosed with probable serotonin syndrome utilizing Hunter\u2019s criteria. Patient\u2019s symptoms resolved within 24 hours with intravenous fluids, lorazepam, and discontinuation of sertraline. This case highlights the importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion in patients even on monotherapy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in therapeutic doses, especially in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder. Due to preexisting hyperserotonemia, they may be more susceptible to serotonin syndrome than the general population. 1. Introduction Antidepressant use is increasing throughout the world. Dur\u0002ing 2015\u20132018 as per National Center for Health Statistics published in 2020, 13.2% of adults aged 18 overused antide\u0002pressant medications in the past 30 days. [1] Among antide\u0002pressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have widespread use for several different psychiatric indica\u0002tions due to their relatively good tolerability and low toxicity profile. Serotonin syndrome (SS), also referred to as seroto\u0002nin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome, is an adverse drug reac\u0002tion characterized by an exaggerated increase in serotonergic activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems [2\u20135]. It comprises a constellation of signs and symptoms related to behavioral changes, neuromuscular excitability, and auto\u0002nomic instability. These symptoms can occur in mild, severe, and potentially fatal forms, presumably, on the extent of increased serotonin [2\u20134, 6, 7]. The clinical diagnosis of SS is typically made using Hunter\u2019s criteria, which is widely considered to be the most accurate tool available, with a sen\u0002sitivity of 84 percent and specificity of 97 percent when compared to the gold standard diagnosis by a medical toxi\u0002cologist. It is less likely to miss early, mild, or subacute forms of SS [6, 8]. Severe toxicity usually occurs only with a combination of two or more serotonergic drugs (even when each is at a therapeutic dose), one of which is generally a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) [2\u20134, 6]. Moderate toxicity has been reported with an overdose of a single drug and occa\u0002sionally from increasing therapeutic doses [2\u20134, 6, 9]. The Hindawi Case Reports in Psychiatry Volume 2023, Article ID 6610152, 4 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/6610152 serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, e.g., desvenlafaxine and venlafaxine) are slightly more likely to cause SS compared with SSRIs but several-fold less likely compared with MAOI\u2019s coingestion [9]. The United States\u2019 Toxic Exposure Surveillance System consistently reports tens of thousands of exposures to SSRIs, many of which involve SS [10]. Its incidence is difficult to assess, but in a large case series of overdoses, moderate SS occurred in 15% of poisonings with SSRIs [9]. There is no existing liter\u0002ature on the incidence of SS in patients with monotherapy of SSRIs presenting with SS. Given SS presents on a spectrum of clinical symptoms and severity, it is not easily suspected in patients with monotherapy as those cases are usually of mild to moderate severity [2\u20134, 6, 9]. In addition, elevated whole blood serotonin level or hyperserotonaemia was the first biomarker identified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is present in more than 25% of affected children [11]. It is unknown if this association makes these patients more susceptible to SS. To date, there are only 9 documented cases of SS from SSRI monotherapy at a therapeutic dose and only 3 with sertraline monotherapy in therapeutic doses [12\u201320]. The purpose of this case report is addition to the increasing number of very few documented cases of SS with SSRI monotherapy and is one of the first reported case in adult patient with ASD. 2. Case Presentation A 32-year-old male with a history of high-functioning ASD (living independently), depression, hypertension, and acid reflux disease was presented. Collateral information from the father confirmed a diagnosis of ASD that was based on detailed neuropsychological testing in childhood. His home medications included losartan 100 mg daily, famotidine 20 mg daily, and sertraline 50 mg daily. Patient shared that he was started on sertraline for his depressive symptoms 4 days ago, and he had taken his 4th dose that morning. He denied any previous history of antidepressant medication use. On the fourth day of sertraline 50 mg dosing, he pre\u0002sented himself to the emergency department (ED) during evening hours with complaints of restlessness and diffuse muscle stiffness; he felt his legs were \u201cstiff and heavy,\u201d and he \u201ccouldn\u2019t really move them\u201d and also described \u201ctoes retching turning inwards\u201d with an unusual but not painful sensation. On physical examination, he was noted to have bilateral upper extremity tremors, ocular clonus with lateral eye movement, and inducible clonus in his right ankle. Cranial nerve exams II-XII were normal, and deep tendon reflexes were not commented upon, so it is unclear if they were examined or not. Vital signs are notable for a heart rate of 61, blood pressure of 164/94, and oxygen saturation of 98% at room air. Routine lab work showed a normal com\u0002plete blood count (CBC) with differential comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) that was unremarkable other than mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mEq/L. Urine drug screen was neg\u0002ative for any substances. Thyroid stimulating hormone level (TSH) and urinalysis were normal. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed sinus rhythm with QTc of 403. Patient was diagnosed with SS using Hunter\u2019s criteria given both inducible and ocular clonus, with restless agita\u0002tion and tremor. Other diagnoses (anticholinergic toxicity, intoxication from sympathomimetic agents, withdrawal from sedative-hypnotic, thyroid storm, and acute extrapyra\u0002midal syndromes) were ruled out as the patient denied taking any other medications or antipsychotic, illicit sub\u0002stances, or supplements on the day of presentation to the ER or before. There are no known drug interactions with the use of sertraline with losartan and famotidine. He received IV fluids with repletion of potassium for mild hypokalemia and IV lorazepam 1 mg with a resolution of symptoms by the next morning and was discharged home with the recommendation to stop taking sertraline. A score of 7 (probable) was obtained using the Naranjo algorithm\u2014adverse drug reaction probability scale to assess for adverse drug reac\u0002tion [21]. Similarly, the WHO-UMC causality assessment sys\u0002tem also suggested a probable/likely adverse drug reaction [22]. Table 1 is adapted from Dunkley et al. [8]. 3. Discussion SS usually is only suspected in cases of overdoses and where SSRIs are being used in conjunction with other medications that lead to excess of serotonergic activity. To date, only 9 case reports of SSRI-induced SS have been reported in the literature when used as monotherapy in therapeutic dose. There are only three reported cases with sertraline mono\u0002therapy, and one was in a 9-year-old child with chronic behavioral problems, who had severe SS with a single dose of sertraline 50 mg [16]. Another case report is of a 36-year-old male who had been on sertraline 100 mg along with hydroxyzine and marijuana use and who presented about two to three months of being on sertraline with SS [19]. There is another case report titled \u201cSS following low\u0002dose sertraline\u201d [20], but no abstract or accessible report could be found. The true incidence or risk factors that predis\u0002pose a person to SS on SSRI monotherapy are unknown. Diagnosis can be challenging as these cases are usually mild to moderate severity [2\u20134, 6, 9] and are easily missed given overlapping symptoms with other syndromes like anticholin\u0002ergic toxicity, intoxication from sympathomimetic agents, withdrawal from sedative-hypnotic (e.g., alcohol, benzodiaz\u0002epine, clonidine, and baclofen), thyroid storm, and acute extrapyramidal syndromes (e.g., dystonic reaction). Our patient with diagnosed ASD in childhood is one of the first cases of SS in this population. It is interesting to note that 25% of patients with ASD have hyperserotonergic activity, which is considered as one of the earliest biomarkers in these patients [11]. This could likely be a risk factor for monotherapy-related SS in patients with comorbid ASD. Although tantalizing clues suggest that changes in peripheral biomarkers are linked to alterations in brain func\u0002tion and behavior in individuals with ASD, the precise role of the serotonin system in the pathophysiology of ASD remains incompletely understood [11]. More studies are needed to understand if there is any association with ASD and the risk of SS with SSRI monotherapy. ASD poses an additional challenge in diagnosis given communication 2 Case Reports in Psychiatry difficulties, repetitive motor movements, and behavioral issues [23] that can lead to easily missed diagnosis of mild to moderate SS since its diagnosis is solely based on history and clinical findings. Treatment of mild to moderate cases of SS includes dis\u0002continuing the offending SSRI. Supportive care is provided, the goals being adequate patient sedation and normal vital signs. Standard interventions include oxygen, intravenous (IV) fluids, and continuous cardiac monitoring. Autonomic instability and hyperthermia require aggressive treatment. Sedation is recommended for the treatment of agitation. Antipyretic agents (e.g., acetaminophen) are ineffective and should not be used for SS. In patients who do not show improvement in agitation or vital signs with benzodiaze\u0002pines and supportive care, treatment with cyproheptadine (5HT2A antagonist), an antagonist at histamine and seroto\u0002nin receptors, is recommended. The initial dose is 12 mg, followed by 2 mg every two hours until a clinical response is seen. Treatment with cyproheptadine is based on anecdote and experience since clinical trials are not available. SS often resolves within 24 hours of discontinuing the serotonergic agent and initiating care, but drugs with long half-lives or active metabolites may cause symptoms to persist [2\u20134, 24]. 4. Conclusions Cases of SS from SSRI monotherapy usually present with mild to moderate severity and, therefore, are not easily suspected. Hunter\u2019s criteria are considered to be the most accurate to diag\u0002nose early, mild, or subacute forms. This case report highlights the importance of SS even in patients on SSRI monotherapy taking therapeutic dosages. It particularly emphasizes the sig\u0002nificance of keeping a high degree of suspicion for SS in ASD patients as some of them may have baseline hyperserotonergic state. Early diagnosis and discontinuation of the serotonergic agent along with supportive management is the most effective treatment of this syndrome.

Cardiac and pulmonary diseases were ruled out.      ri_benavente@uchile.cl        Co-oximetry in two different analyzers showed interference or normal MetHb       percentages. No other complications ensued, and cyanosis decreased over days.        Since MetHb was discarded among other causes of cyanosis in a compatible cli        nical context, the diagnosis of sulfhemoglobinemia was made. The confirmatory        method is not available in Chile. The presence of SulfHb is difficult to diagnose,        confirmatory tests are not readily available, and it frequently interferes with        arterial co-oximetry. This is attributed to a similar absorbance peak of both       pigments in arterial blood. Venous co-oximetry can be useful in this context.        SulfHb is a self-limited condition in most cases, however it must be differentiated       from methemoglobinemia to avoid inappropriate treatments like methylene blue.

Primary pulmonary intravascular large B\u2011cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare, malignant extranodal lymphoma. It is difficult to diagnose clinically as it requires a combination of clinical and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, as well as laboratory and pathological examinations. In the present study, 4 cases of primary pulmonary IVLBCL were reviewed. The patients' ages ranged from 60 to 69 years old. Of the 4 patients, 3 developed progressive dyspnea on exertion and intermittent fever. Other symptoms included coughing, chest tightness and weight loss. Laboratory data indicated that all patients had anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoxemia, a markedly high serum lactate dehydrogenase level, elevated erythrocyte sedimenta\u2011 tion rate and increased C\u2011reactive protein. CT demonstrated increased attenuation in bilateral lung parenchyma, especially in the upper lobes, with multiple ground\u2011glass opacities associ\u2011 ated with small nodules in these patients. Initially, all 4 patients were misdiagnosed with pneumonia. However, none of them responded to anti\u2011inflammatory treatments. The patholo\u2011 gies of all patients were confirmed using lung biopsy. Only 1 patient received regular combination chemotherapy. Based on the observations of the present study, a standard regimen for lymphoma treatment may result in a notable clinical response. Introduction Intravascular large B\u2011cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is an aggres\u2011 sive type of extranodal malignant lymphoma with selective proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells within the vascular lumina (1). It is divided into \u2018Eastern\u2019 and \u2018Western\u2019 variants, with the former often being associated with bone marrow involvement and hemophagocytic syndrome, and the latter showing central nervous system and skin involvement (2\u20114). Pulmonary involvement of IVLBCL is relatively frequent at ~60% (5), and the majority of these cases are secondary lymphomas originating from systemic diseases. However, initial or predominant pulmonary presentations are rarely reported (5). With vascular occlusion of the lungs, patients may show some non\u2011specific clinical presentations, such as hypoxemia, shortness of breath or fever, which may also occur in a number of other lung diseases, such as infection, infarction and diffuse interstitial pneumonia. Thus, primary pulmonary IVLBCL is highly misdiagnosed in clinical prac\u2011 tice, and is often confirmed at autopsy or by lung biopsy (6). The present study summarized 4 cases of primary pulmonary IVLBCL and reviewed the previous literature in this area. The patients of the present study were diagnosed based on clinical and computed tomographic (CT) evaluations, as well as the laboratory and pathological examinations at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (Nanjing, China). These cases presented at this hospital between March 2010 and March 2017. Case report Case 1. A 69\u2011year\u2011old female patient was referred to Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital in March 2010 with a 2\u2011month history of coughing with white sputum without cause and progressive dyspnea on exertion. In addition, the patient experienced fever (37.3\u201139.8\u02daC) for a duration of 1 week. A physical examination revealed cyanosis of the lips, edema of the lower limbs, clear consciousness, no skin rashes, nodules or hemorrhagic spots and no hepatosplenomegaly. After admission, CT examination was performed. The CT images demonstrated increased attenuation in bilateral lung parenchyma with multiple ground\u2011glass opaci\u2011 ties (GGOs) and part progression to consolidation (Fig. 1A), especially on the superior lobes. Interlobular septal thickening and partial thickening of bronchovascular bundles as well as \u2018tram track\u2011like\u2019 changes were observed (Fig. 1A), along Primary pulmonary intravascular large B\u2011cell lymphoma misdiagnosed as pneumonia: Four case reports and a literature review MENGXIA ZHU1,2, YING CHANG1 , HAIJIAN FAN1 , JIONG SHI3 , BIN ZHU1,2 and XIAOLI MAI1,2 1 Department of Radiology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Nanjing University; 2 Department of Radiology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital Clinical College of Nanjing Medical University; 3 Department of Pathology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, P.R.

During hospitalization, treatment for infection using imipenem/cilastatin sodium (0.5 g/8 h) with intermit\u2011 tent use of acetaminophen tablets (0.5 g) for fever reduction was administered, but no notable effect was revealed. Finally, pulmonary IVLBCL was diagnosed using transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB). Abnormal lymphoid cells distributed within the blood vessels were observed under a light microscope, and the diagnosis of pulmonary IVLBCL was further confirmed through immunohistochemical staining. The patient rejected chemotherapy treatment and died due to respiratory failure shortly (20 days) after diagnosis. Case 2. A 68\u2011year\u2011old male with a past medical history of diabetes for ~20 years presented at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital in May 2012 with a 2\u2011month history of coughing with scantly white sputum, chest tightness, dyspnea on exertion and a recurrent low\u2011grade fever. The patient experienced weight loss (~3 kg) during these 2 months. The patient underwent chest CT. Initial CT imaging evaluation indicated a ground pattern in a mosaic distribution and small centrilobular nodules (Fig. 2A). The patient received anti\u2011inflammatory treatment. However, the symptoms did not significantly improve. Bone marrow aspiration followed by biopsy indicated that the patient had pancytopenia, and a fluorescent in situ hybridization study detected clonal rearrangements of Ig\u03ba\u2011VJ and Ig\u03ba\u2011V/in, without immunoglobulin heavy locus/BCL2, BCL6 and c\u2011MYC frag\u2011 mentations or TP53 deletion. TBLB was performed, which demonstrated only a small number of atypical cells. Primary pulmonary IVLBCL was eventually confirmed using open lung biopsy. An incision was made in the fourth intercostal space along the anterior axillary line of the left side of the chest, and lung tissues were respectively excised from the lingual and dorsal segments of the left upper lobe and the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe. The patient started receiving rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincris\u2011 tine and prednisolone (R\u2011CHOP) treatment but experienced an allergic reaction after being injected with rituximab (600 mg). Rituximab was removed from the treatment plan, and after improvement with anti\u2011allergy treatment, the patient received 6 cycles of CHOP [1.2 g cyclophosphamide, intravenously (iv) day l; 90 mg doxorubicin, iv day l; 4 mg vincristine, iv day l; 50 mg prednisolone, orally twice per day, days 1\u20115] treatment, with each cycle lasting for 3 weeks. At completion of the sixth cycle, the disease was in complete remission. As visualized using a CT scan, the bilateral lungs were clear (Fig. 2B). A seventh cycle of chemotherapy began with CHOP (same drug dosage as aforementioned) within 3 months of the comple\u2011 tion of the sixth cycle as the patient was admitted to hospital with a fever, cough and chest discomfort. At 2 weeks after discharge after the seventh cycle, an additional three cycles of CHOP (same drug dosage as aforementioned) were provided at 1\u2011week intervals. An additional three cycles of ifosfamide (8 g, iv day 2), carboplatin (500 mg, iv day 2) and etoposide (0.16 g, iv days 1\u20113) were administered only 1 month after the latest completion of chemotherapy for the recurrence of cough, sputum and fever. The patient's clinical symptoms improved markedly after the treatment. However, the patient was hospitalized again 1 year later due to fever and infection secondary to myelosuppression. Eventually, the treatment failed, and the patient passed away. Case 3. A 65\u2011year\u2011old male patient was admitted to Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital in March 2017 with a 3\u2011month history of progressive dyspnea and cough. The patient had no prior history of lung disease, chest pain, intermittent fever or night sweating. No focal findings were noted on physical examination, especially of the skin and central nervous system, and lymph nodes were not palpable. A CT examina\u2011 tion revealed diffuse ground\u2011glass attenuation and thickened interlobular septa in the upper lungs (Fig. 3A and B). No abnormal soft tissue mass was observed in the mediastinum, bilateral hilus and axilla. Whole\u2011body positron emission tomography\u2011computed tomography (PET\u2011CT) scan revealed only mild 18F\u2011fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in both lungs. The patient was mistakenly diagnosed with pneumonia and received wide\u2011spectrum antibiotics treatment (2 g cefazoxime sodium, twice per day) for half a month. The patient's symp\u2011 toms continued, and the treatment had no effect. The patient was discharged from hospital after diagnosis of IVLBCL using TBLB and did not return for follow\u2011up treatment and examination. Case 4. A 60\u2011year\u2011old female patient presented at Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital in August 2015 with a 1\u2011month history of progressive dyspnea and a 20\u2011day history of intermittent high fever, with a maximum temperature of ~39\u02daC. The patient had no history of lung disease and was a non\u2011smoker. No cyanosis, clubbing, neurological abnormalities, nor cuta\u2011 neous lesions were observed on physical examination. A high revolution chest CT (HRCT) examination was performed, and the images revealed pulmonary nodules with part\u2011solid diffused GGOs in the lungs without pleural involvement (Fig. 4A and B). Additional examinations of whole\u2011body CT examination yielded normal findings. The patient was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and the infection was treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride (0.4 g/day) and sodium chloride injection solution for 7 days, and intermittent use of indomethacin (0.05 g) for antipyretic treatment, but the symptoms did not notably improve. Since there were no specific clinical or imaging findings and anti\u2011inflammatory therapy failed, the patient underwent TBLB examination (of the superior lobe of the right lung). Light microscopy revealed a diffuse intravascular proliferation of atypical B cells and, combined with immunohistochemistry, IVLBCL was diagnosed. After a short period of glucocorticoids (40 mg methylprednisolone sodium succinate per day) treatment, the dyspnea initially improved, and the treatment appeared to be working. Unfortunately, the patient eventu\u2011 ally discharged and gave up treatment due to a severe and uncontrollable lung infection. Laboratory results. Laboratory data demonstrated that the patients had anemia (n=4, 100%), thrombocytopenia (n=4, 100%), pancytopenia (n=3, 75%) and hypoxemia (n=4, 100%). Laboratory findings were notable for marked high serum lactate dehydro\u2011 genase (LDH) levels, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs) and increased C\u2011reactive protein (CRP) levels (Table I). Histopathological results. All patients underwent TBLB, and partial tissue biopsies of different segments of the lung lobes were performed. Only 1 patient underwent open lung biopsy. ONCOLOGY LETTERS 25: 234, 2023 3 The pathological analysis showed mild expansion of the capil\u2011 lary lumen within alveolar and peribronchial interstitial tissue by a proliferation of large tumor cells. The intravascular tumor cells had multiple (1\u20113) nucleoli, little cytoplasm, high nucleus to cytoplasm ratios and irregular nuclear contours. Mitoses, including atypical forms, were observed. Immunohistochemical results. The tissues were incubated in 10% neutral formalin fixative for overnight fixation at room temperature for 12 h. After slicing the sample to a thickness of 4 \u00b5m and performing deparaffinization and hydration pretreatments, 3% hydrogen peroxide was added to cover the part to be stained with peroxidase blocking agent, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Mouse primary antibody was added to the sample and incubated overnight at 4\u02daC. Rabbit secondary antibody, with a horse\u2011 radish peroxidase conjugate, was added to the sample and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. DAB (Ultraview Universal DAB Kit; Roche Tissue Diagnostics) was used for 10 sec of chromogenic staining, followed by staining with hematoxylin for 4\u20118 min at room temperature. Finally, the location and intensity of the markers were observed under an optical microscope. The primary antibodies selected include: CD20 (cat. no. ZM\u20110039), CD79a (cat. no. ZA\u20110293), CD31 (cat. no. ZM\u20110044), CD3 (cat. no. ZM\u20110417), CD10 (cat. no. ZM\u20110283), CD5 (cat. no. ZM\u20110280), Bcl\u20116 (cat. no. ZM\u20110011), and Mum\u20111 (cat. no. ZM\u20110401), all purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. H&E and immunohistochemistry staining revealed tumor cells that were positive for CD20 (n=4, 100%) and CD79a (n=3, 75%), which identified all four tumors as a lymphoma of B cell lineage (Fig. 5A\u2011C). In addition, the tumor cells of all 4 cases were negative for the T cell markers, CD3 and cytokeratin (n=4, 100%). CD31 was positive in the small vessel endothelium of case 2 (Fig. 5D). Only 1 case was considered to have a germinal center B cell (GCB) phenotype, as the cells were positive for CD10, BCL6 and multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (Mum\u20111) (Table II). Discussion In 1959, Pfleger and Tappeiner first reported a type of malignant lymphoma, k nown as \u2018malignant Figure 1. Case 1.

Malignant angioendothe\u2011 liomatosis is an uncommon subcategory of extranodal large B\u2011cell lymphoma derived from blood vessels and features the presence of large tumor cells (4,8,9). A study recommended differentiating the classification of \u2018classical IVLBCL\u2019 and \u2018IVLBCL associated with hemophagocytic syndrome\u2019 due to the crossover of clinical manifestations, without being limited to regional differences in Europe and Asia (4). \u2018Classical IVLBCL\u2019 is characterized by cutaneous and/or neurological involvement. The features of \u2018IVLBCL associated with hemophagocytic syndrome\u2019 are hemophagocytic syndrome, bone marrow involvement, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or thrombocytopenia (4). Pulmonary IVLBCL without evidence of extrapulmo\u2011 nary involvement is uncommonly reported and is difficult to diagnose antemortem (10,11). It predominantly occurs in the 6th decade of life and is likely to get worse if not treated with an adequate remedy. The clinical manifestations of pulmonary IVLBCL are non\u2011specific, and share numerous clinical features with pulmonary tumor embolism, which are often experienced in both diseases, including dyspnea, fever, cough, night sweats, tachypnea and hypoxemia (3,5,6,12\u201114). The immortal proliferation cells (abnormally proliferating B lymphocytes) play a central role in the development of pulmonary tumor embolism, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale are almost irreversibly asso\u2011 ciated with blood clots that occur in the lung (12). Pulmonary function testing typically measures reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide compared with normal baselines (13). In addition, serum LDH, ESR and CRP levels are often elevated by different degrees in IVLBCL (1,4,11). All these results may indicate that a patient is suffering from a type of lymph\u2011prolif\u2011 erative disease. Compared with other pulmonary lymphoma, IVLBCL generally does not involve lymphadenopathy or a localizing solid mass, as the lymphomatous cells mainly involve the pulmonary arteries and capillary beds (14). Results of CT assessments are diverse and can be inconspicuous or show GGO and interstitial infiltration (11,12,14). In the cases of the present study, patchy areas of GGO existed on patient presentation and this accentuated the bilateral lung attenu\u2011 ation resulting from pulmonary vascular obstruction. In case 1, the chest HRCT revealed bilateral disease that was pneumonia\u2011like, which progressed partly to consolidation. Figure 3. Case 3. (A) Axial computed tomography slice of the chest showed diffused ground\u2011glass attenuation. (B) Coronal images demonstrate predominant distribution in the upper lobes of bilateral lungs. Figure 4. Case 4. (A and B) Axial computed tomography slices of the chest images revealed pulmonary nodules with part\u2011solid diffused ground\u2011glass opacities (arrows).

The other 3 cases showed bilateral GGOs, micronodules and thickened interlobular septa in the lungs without pleural involvement, which suggested that the disease may spread along lymphatic structures. In case 2, the pulmonary shadows completely disappeared after a short\u2011term chemotherapy schedule, which supported the diagnosis of IVLBCL. The etiology of GGO (heterogeneous and partially consolidated) in all four patients remains unclear. Malignant cells may invade the alveolar space, resulting in consolidation (increased density) on CT imaging. Increased diffuse density in bilateral lungs with GGOs and thickening of interstitial septum needs to be distinguished from non\u2011neoplastic lesions, such as interstitial diseases and mechanical pneumonia, which may also present as progressive dyspnea with cough and other manifestations of obstructive ventilation. TBLB and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can be used to aid diagnosis. Undoubtably, IVLBCL needs to be differentiated from venous thromboembolism and other intravascular malignancies of the lung, including lymphomatoid granulomatosis, angiocentric lymphoma and pulmonary involvement by acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (3). At this point of the patient examination, the clinical manifestations and CT characteristics may be non\u2011specific, and immunohistochemistry will provide great help for the correct diagnosis. PET\u2011CT is used in the early diagnosis of isolated pulmo\u2011 nary IVLBCL (11,15) as it can differentiate IVLBCL from other lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonia. PET\u2011CT scans typically show a high meta\u2011 bolic activity of tumor cells in IVLBCL, which is similar to that observed for diffuse large B\u2011cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as IVLBCL falls under the category of DLBCL (16). At present, PET has a high ability to differentiate lymph nodes, especially invasive lymph node lesions, and almost all the lymph nodes and extranodal organs can be found through a single examination. PET has been widely used in the diagnosis, staging and restaging, efficacy evaluation and prognosis prediction of lymphoma. However, only 1 case in the present study presented pulmonary mild 18F\u2011FDG uptake on PET, which was atypical. Histological findings, such as pulmonary veins, peribron\u2011 chial arterioles and accumulation of malignant lymphocytes, are key for the definitive diagnosis of primary pulmonary IVLBCL (3,13). Moreover, small vessels filled with large B cells are also confirmed using H&E staining. B cell markers (CD19, CD20, CD79a and PAX5) are usually expressed while T cell markers (CD3 and CD4) are typically negative on immunohistochemical examination (3,9). CD31 mainly marks Figure 5. The morphology and immunohistochemical study showed that (A) the predominant growth of neoplastic cells was within the small blood vessels (H&E staining) and the intravascular cells were immunoreactive to (B) CD20, (C) CD79 and (D) CD31, which are immunophenotypic features of B cell lymphoma. Magnification, x40. ONCOLOGY LETTERS 25: 234, 2023 7 endothelial tissue and can be used to identify benign and malig\u2011 nant vasogenic tumors. Meanwhile, CD31 is not expressed in non\u2011vasogenic tumors, so it has high specificity and sensitivity for studying vasogenic tumors (17). Pathologically, IVLBCL and DLBCL have similar cytology and sometimes the same immunophenotypes. Nonetheless, combined with CT find\u2011 ings, DLBCL often presents as a localized solid mass and is easy to identify. In the present study, 1 patient was posi\u2011 tive for CD31, indicating endovascular origin of the tumor. CD10 or BCL6 are hallmarks for the determination for GCB and non\u2011GCB (3,10). Based on the Hans algorithm, cases of CD10+  VLBCL are categorized as GCB\u2011type (1,10,18), thus, the large B cells in case 3 were CD10+ /Bcl\u20116+ /Mum\u20111+ , which is classified as a GCB\u2011type in immunopheno\u2011 typical analysis. Moreover, GCB phenotypes with patterns such as CD10+/BCL6+/Mum\u20111+ , CD10+/BCL6\u2011 /Mum\u20111+ , CD10 +/BCL\u20116\u2011 /Mum\u20111\u2011 , CD10 +/BCL6 +/Mum\u20111\u2011  and CD10\u2011 /BCL\u20116+/Mum\u20111\u2011 , are considered to indicate an improved prognosis compared with that of a non\u2011GCB pheno\u2011 type (18,19). In total, ~20% of cases of IVLBCL have been classified as GCB\u2011type (1), which corresponds with the results of the present study. In the case of malignant tumor, a high Ki\u201167 proliferation index (PI) in neoplastic cells is closely associated with poor prognosis. At present, the majority of researchers agree that a 20% cut\u2011off PI for Ki\u201167 in lymphoma is clinically mean\u2011 ingful (20). The Ki\u201167 PI was \u226520% (20\u201170%) in the present study. In addition, in the present study, the patient of case 2 underwent genetic testing, which demonstrated no specific chromosomal alterations and no clonal rearrangement of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, but a genetic recombination of Ig\u03ba\u2011VJ and Ig\u03ba\u2011V/in was detected, indicating abnormal lymphocyte proliferation (9). Structural abnormalities of chromosomes 1 (1p), 6 and 18 (trisomy 18) have also been previously reported (3). With an improved clinical awareness and the development of immunohistochemical technology, it is possible to confirm the diagnosis of this rare disease during the lifetime of the patient. The present study performed a diagnosis of 4 living patient cases of primary pulmonary IVLBCL using lung tissue biopsies (3 cases by TBLB and 1 case by open lung biopsy). IVLBCL is a diffuse lung disease and, even though TBLB is already highly diagnostic, due to the limited availability of lung tissue samples from minimally invasive procedures leading to a failed accurate diagnosis, a surgical lung biopsy may ultimately be performed. Furthermore, we hypothesize that it will be possible for IVLBCL to be cured in the future. Treatment applied in combination with chemotherapy for intermediate and high\u2011grade lymphomas has achieved success in the field of long\u2011term disease\u2011free survival (3,10). In addi\u2011 tion, combined systemic chemotherapy, similar to that for diffuse large B\u2011cell lymphoma, may help treat IVLBCL with long\u2011term disease\u2011free survival as a clinical outcome (13). In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that primary pulmonary IVLBCL should be considered in differential diagnoses, especially when GGOs are associated with small nodules and thickened interlobular septa in the upper lung. Other general clinical manifestations include fever, night sweats and weight loss, high elevations in serum LDH, ESR and CRP in laboratory examination and no response to anti\u2011inflammatory treatments. A histopathological examina\u2011 tion of lung biopsy samples is needed to confirm the definitive diagnosis and therapeutic procedures. The present study also demonstrated the potential diagnostic effectiveness of TBLB in early diagnosis and the relative non\u2011invasiveness of the technique, compared with open chest surgery. Taken together, a standard regimen for lymphoma treatment may result in an overall improved clinical response. Acknowledgements Not applicable.

Learning points for clinicians Macroscopic T-wave alternans (TWA) signifies significant vulnerability during repolarization and may be a harbinger of impending electrical instability. Although macroscopic TWA is not frequently encountered in routine clinical practice. Prompt identification is essential for proper management and prevention of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Introduction This case study presents the electrocardiographic (ECG) findings of a 70-year-old male with chronic heart failure caused by atrial fibrillation, who developed macrovolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and subsequent malignant arrhythmia after amiodarone treatment. The presence of TWA and QT alternans disappeared after discontinuation of amiodarone and appropriate magnesium replacement, indicating a strong correlation with the observed arrhythmogenic cardiac distress. This report highlights the significance of TWA detection in predicting malignant arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Case presentation A 70-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure due to atrial fibrillation was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath. His serum K\u00fe was 4.4mmol/l and Mg2\u00fe was 1.3mmol/l. Intravenous amiodarone therapy was initiated, and after 72 h of drug exposure (total dose of 4.5 g amiodarone), sinus rhythm was successfully restored. However, the patient exhibited a marked QTc prolongation from a baseline value of 401\u2013582ms. During his hospital stay, he experienced a sudden loss of consciousness, prompting an immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) recording (Figure 1). The ECG revealed an exceptionally prolonged and alternating QT intervals (560 and 700ms) and a distinct beat-to-beat alternation in T-wave morphology, known as TWA. The patient experienced a single brief episode of torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (Figure 2). Following the discontinuation of intravenous amiodarone and appropriate magnesium replacement, both the TWA and QT alternans resolved completely. No recurrence of arrhythmia was observed during the patient\u2019s hospital stay, and his condition gradually improved. Discussion The ECG manifestation of TWA, characterized by a repetitive ABABAB pattern in the morphology and amplitude of the T wave, is associated with arrhythmia due to spatiotemporal heterogeneity of repolarization.1 The exact mechanism of TWA is not completely elucidated, but it is presumed to be associated with cyclic changes in intracellular calcium concentrations.2 At the cellular level, two major hypotheses have been proposed. First, alternating changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane voltages and action potential results in beat-to-beat changes in intracellular calcium concentration. Second, fluctuations in the intracellular calcium concentration are the primary event that results in membrane voltage alternation and variability of action potential morphologies seen in TWA.3 The mechanism linking TWA to arrhythmogenesis is associated with the Submitted: 15 May 2023 VC The Author(s) 2023.

This case demonstrates that macrovolt TWA serves as a crucial indicator of acute arrhythmogenic cardiac distress and can be readily detected with the naked eye. This rare clinical phenomenon has led to the development of microvolt T-wave alternans as a risk stratification tool for sudden arrhythmic cardiac death.1 Patients with TWA visible on the surface ECG should promptly Figure 1.

A 70-year-old male patient with a personal history of arterial hypertension, poliomyelitis and for a month had been receiving treatment with 500 mg of ciprofloxacin every 12 hours and 500 mg of metronidazole every 8 hours for ostheomyelitis due to contiguity of a perianal abscess secondary to a Crohn's flare. He was admitted due to dysarthria, gait ataxia and dysphagia of four days of evolution. The examination revealed ataxia, dysarthria and dysmetria of the left upper limb, with no other neurological focus. Laboratory parameters were normal, including iron metabolism, vitamin B12 concentrations , and serologies for syphilis, Borrelia , and Brucella. Cranial computed axial tomography showed chronic ischemic lesions and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a diffuse increase in signal on T2 and FLAIR sequence of both dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, symmetrical, without mass effect, highly suggestive of transient edema secondary to treatment with metronidazole (Figure 1). The drug was discontinued with clinical improvement and complete relief of the lesions in the brain magnetic resonance imaging after 7 days. 1097 CLINICAL CASE BACKGROUND Machine Translated by Google Internal Medicine of Mexico Figure 2. Electrocardiogram showing negative T in precordial leads. Metronidazole neurotoxicity can cause manifestations of the central nervous system, such as epileptic seizures or cerebellar syndrome, or of the peripheral nervous system, such as sensory or autonomic neuropathy.1-6 It usually affects patients in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The dose required to cause this toxicity is unknown, although duration of treatment, total cumulative dose, and coexistence of hepatic dysfunction are possible risk factors.1,2,7,8 The pathogenesis of Treatment with beta-blockers was started and the transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated 5 days later with a clear decrease in segmental contractility abnormalities, persisting mild dyskinesia very localized at the apical level and maintaining a preserved LVEF. Metronidazole neurotoxicity is not exactly known, although vasogenic edema is believed to be the cause of cerebellar lesions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging is decisive for diagnosis, as it generally shows bilateral, symmetrical, hyperintense lesions without mass effect on T2, located in the cerebellar dentate nuclei, the midbrain, the dorsal pons, and the corpus callosum.2,8 The study of neuropathic symptoms should be complemented with an electroneurogram . The relief of symptoms and the reversibility of the lesions in the magnetic resonance imaging after discontinuation of the drug are characteristic.9,10 However, clinical improvement does not always coincide with the radiological one, and neuropathy can persist for weeks.1,2 Even, patients with a fatal outcome have been described in whom it is speculated that the delay in discontinuing metroni had an iDISCUSSION 2022; 38 (5) 1098 https://doi.org/10.24245/mim.v38i5.4556 Machine Translated by Google Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda GM, et al.

It can lead to severe left ventricular dysfunction, which is characteristically reversible and has a very good prognosis. Patients commonly have chest pain and ST elevation on ECG, but coronary arteriography does not show significant lesions.12 It affects postmenopausal women more frequently and is rare in men, unlike our case.11 Precipitating factors for this cardiomyopathy are acute emotional stress, intense exercise, surgery, and medical conditions such as pneumonia, hypoglycemia, or neurological disorders including subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke or epilepsy.12 In our patient, the cardiac affectation was precipitated by the neurological affectation without alteration of the enzymes of myocardial damage or symptoms that suggested cardiac disease . There is no agreement regarding the pharmacological treatment, although beta-blockers are the most prescribed. Relief of dyskinesia occurs in the majority of patients in approximately one month, so the prognosis is favourable.11 dazol despite the onset of neurological symptoms.2 There are published cases in which the symptoms of the central and peripheral nervous system coincide in time, with the initial appearance of cerebellar syndrome with ataxia and dysarthria followed by peripheral neuropathy, which can persist for weeks after rapid relief of the central nervous system symptoms when the drug is discontinued.1 On the other hand, stress cardiomyopathy, also called takotsubo or broken heart, is a myocardial stunning syndrome precipitated by situations of acute stress associated with supraphysiological release of catecholamines and hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system.11 antibiotic, clinical and radiological relief on discontinuation is characteristic. Our case is associated with takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to stress caused by neurological involvement.

Sulfhemoglobinemia secondary to the use of zopiclone. Report of two cases  work did not receive financing.  Sulfhemoglobin (SulfHb) is formed by hemoglobin (Hb) oxidation by sulfur compounds. Sulfhemoglobinemia is mainly associated with drugs or intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Patients present with central cyanosis, an abnormal pulse oximetry and normal arterial oxygen partial pressure. These features are shared with methemoglobinemia (MetHb) whose diagnosis requires an arterial co-oxi metry. Depending on the device used, SulfHb may produce interference with this technique. We report two females aged 31 and 43 years, consulting at the emergency room with cyanosis. Both had a history of acute and chronic, high dose zopiclone ingestion. Pulse oximetry showed desaturation but with normal arterial oxygen partial pressure. Cardiac and pulmonary diseases were ruled out. Co-oximetry in two different analyzers showed interference or normal MetHb percentages. No other complications ensued, and cyanosis decreased over days. Since MetHb was discarded among other causes of cyanosis in a compatible cli nical context, the diagnosis of sulfhemoglobinemia was made. The confirmatory method is not available in Chile. The presence of SulfHb is difficult to diagnose, confirmatory tests are not readily available, and it frequently interferes with arterial co-oximetry. This is attributed to a similar absorbance peak of both pigments in arterial blood. Venous co-oximetry can be useful in this context. SulfHb is a self-limited condition in most cases, however it must be differentiated from methemoglobinemia to avoid inappropriate treatments like methylene blue.

It is generated by the oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb) and subsequent acquisition of sulfur atoms1,2. It manifests clinically as central cyanosis with decreased pulse oximetry, but with normal arterial O2 pressure (PaO2 ), in patients without cardiovascular or respiratory disease2,3. It is   toclopramide, phenazopyridine or ferrous sulfate4,5. It has also been reported in occupational exposure to sulfur chemicals, constipation and intestinal overgrowth of sulfate-reducing bacteria3,6,7. The objective of this work is to report two cases of sulfohemoglobinemia related to the consumption of high doses of zopiclone.

In his vital signs on admission, he was hemodynamically stable, without ventilatory pressure, and on physical examination marked cyanosis of the skin and mucous membranes was detected (Figure 1), associated with pulse oximetry of 69% ambient. In addition, in the segmental examination he presented tenderness in the hypogastrium, without signs of peritoneal irritation or palpation of masses. Supplementary O2 was administered at 26%, increasing saturation to 79%,   The admission laboratory (Table 1) showed mild normocytic anemia and an arterial blood gas without hypoxemia. Computed tomography angiography of the chest (Angio-CT) ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE), and CT of the abdomen and pelvis only showed abundant stools. There was no toxicological study. To rule out the presence of methemoglobin (MetHb), co-oximetry was performed (Cobas\u00ae b221 analyzer) which reported interference in the arterial sample and 0% MetHb in the venous sample.

Discussion Sulphohemoglobinemia is a rare hemoglobinopathy caused by oxidation of Hb and irreversible incorporation of a sulfur atom into the porphyrin ring. It has a low affinity for O2 that makes it ineffective for the transport of this gas1 .  At low levels of the abnormal pigment, the percentage of physiologically affected Hb is greater than the percentage of sulphidation. Although Hb tetramers do not contain more than one or two sulfurized hemo groups, the entire molecule changes to the deoxygenated conformation; also reducing the affinity for O2 of its non-sulfur subunits (allosteric regulation). This \u201cshift to the right\u201d of O2 partial pressure to achieve 50% Hb saturation (p50) increases O2 delivery to tissues. For this reason, there is no dyspnea, unless the SulfHb levels are extraordinarily high. This is in contrast to methemoglobinemia, in which a \u201cleft shift\u201d of p50 alters O2 supply and exacerbates the decline in O2 transport capacity8 .  The clinical presentation consists of central cyanosis with decreased pulse oximetry and PaO2. normal, in patients without cardiovascular or respiratory disease3,5,6,9. The marked cyanosis is due to the greenish color of the pigment and is usually described as \"greyish\". This presentation is shared with methemoglobinemia1 , a much more frequent condition, and constitutes the main differential diagnosis. For the diagnosis of this last condition, co-oximetry is used, which consists of the automated measurement of the main fractions of Hb (OxiHb, DesoxiHb, COHb, MetHb)6,10.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of   Available CO-oximeters fail to detect SulfHb. Furthermore, their presence is often interpreted as interference, as was initially the case in this case. This phenomenon was studied in detail by Chan et al, who also noted that when using venous blood samples, the same CO-oximeter was able to correctly detect MetHb even in the presence of SulfHb11. The authors propose two possible reasons. First, in arterial blood SulfHb and MetHb have very similar maximum absorbance wavelengths (623 and 626 nm, respectively); which is modified in the case of venous deoxy- SulfHb (619 nm). In addition, they noted that in arterial blood, the amount of SulfHb is higher than in venous blood. Therefore, they propose that in case of interference in arterial blood, co-oximetry in venous blood is an alternative to quantify MetHb and rule it out as a cause of cyanosis11. In the first case presented, the initial venous sample ruled out the presence of MetHb and allowed us to establish the diagnosis of Sulfohemoglobinemia. In the second case, both samples showed interference, noting that this phenomenon may not be constant. The method of choice for the detection and quantification of SulfHb consists of spectrophotometry with the addition of cyanide, to form cyano-MetHb and eliminate the peak of the MetHb absorption band (cyanide does not affect the SulfHb absorption band)8,11. To our knowledge, this method is not available in our country in clinical laboratories. Recently, MALDI- TOF mass spectrophotometry has been proposed as an alternative for the diagnosis of this condition12. As previously mentioned, SulfHb is mainly associated with the use of drugs or constipation. However, what the sulfur atom contributes has not been fully elucidated, postulating glutathione or hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria such as Morganella morgagni8 .  We present two cases of sulfohemoglobinemia possibly related to the use of high doses of zopiclone. This hypnotic is frequently used in Chile13 and has potential for abuse, due to its disinhibitory effects14. This drug has previously been associated with sulfohemoglobinemia, in the context of intoxication  1404   Reef With Chile 2022; 150: 1401-1406   CLINICAL CASES  Sulphohemoglobinemia due to drug - R. Benavente et al multiple with ethanol and antihistamines11. In addition, zopiclone and its derived metabolites have been shown to produce oxidative stress in erythrocytes, producing both methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia15,16. From the point of view of the causal relationship, both cases can be classified as a possible adverse reaction to drugs, using two of the most widely used tools in this scenario17; the Kach and Lasagna18 criteria and the Naranjo19 algorithm. In favor of the association we can highlight the previous report11, the temporal relationship, the high doses committed and the disappearance of cyanosis when withdrawing the drug. On the contrary, the concurrence of other substances and the absence of reexposure do not allow a definitive association to be established. Since SulfHb formation is not reversible and does not cause tissue hypoxia in most cases, treatment is conservative, waiting for the physiological turnover of the affected red blood cells. However, it is important to differentiate it from methemoglobinemia to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments, such as methylene blue infusion.  Conclusion  Sulfohemoglobinemia is an infrequent pathology and difficult to diagnose; the confirmatory method is not available and interference with MetHb in arterial co-oximetry is frequent, its main differential diagnosis. In these cases, it has been described that venous co-oximetry can adequately rule out the presence of MetHb. Fortunately, its evolution is self-limiting, but its causes must be recognized and unnecessary therapies avoided.   1406   Reef With Chile 2022; 150: 1401-1406 ", "tokens": [{"text": "Chile", "start":

It belongs to the group of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). NA and 5-HT have receptors on the surface of platelets and are involved in platelet aggregation. In this case study, we present the case of a patient treated for one of the types of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), essential thrombocythemia (ET), in whom VEN was added to pharmacotherapy during the treatment of a severe episode of depression with psychotic symptoms. We observed a gradual reduction in platelet count when increasing the dose of VEN.We also present a narrative review of literature about the effect of VEN on platelet counts and activity. We conclude that, in the group of patients taking VEN, attention should be paid to the rare adverse effect of a decrease in the number of platelets. Keywords: essential thrombocythemia; major depressive disorder; depression; SNRI; drug-induced thrombocytopenia; thrombocytopenia/chemically induced 1. Introduction Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of blood cancers characterized by a benign onset but with a tendency to develop into malignant cancer in the future. According to theWorld Health Organization (WHO) classification, we divide MPNs into chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia (ET), chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and unclassifiable MPNs [1]. Two of them, CML and ET, are characterized by thrombocythemia in blood tests [2]. Patients with MPNs in the daytime experience a wide range of symptoms associated with abnormal cell division in the bone marrow. The most common symptoms are fatigue, pruritus, and night sweats [3]. Fatigue is also one of the common symptoms of depression [4]. A large international study shows fatigue as one of the most common symptoms of myeloproliferative neoplasm, and proves that in the ingroup of patients with this type of proliferative disease, the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) is almost 25% [5]. Another study prepared by Padrnos L. et al. also shows that depressive symptoms appear in as many as 23% of patients with MPNs [6]. One of the drugs recommended for the treatment of MDD is venlafaxine (VEN) [7]. This drug belongs to the group of serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). At low doses, it causes an increase in serotoninergic transmission. At higher doses (higher than 225 mg), it causes an increase in noradrenergic transmission [8,9]. VEN is now considered one of the most effective antidepressants, which is confirmed by studies describing its efficacy in treating resistant depression [10]. Medicina 2022, 58, 626. https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58050626 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/medicina Medicina 2022, 58, 626 2 of 8 Thus far, there are no scientific reports describing the effects of depression and antidepressant treatment on the production of the morphotic elements of blood in bone marrow; however, for many years, researchers\u2019 attention has been drawn to the relationship between depression and changes in the number of platelets and mean platelet volume (MPV), as well as changes in the prothrombotic phenotype of platelets [11\u201313]. The potential cause of such changes is increased sympathetic activity in the course of depression [14]. This is due to the increased sensitivity of the nervous system to stressors in people with MDD. In this situation, stress factors, affecting the nervous system, increase corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production in the pituitary gland. CRH then affects another part of our nervous system, the locus coeruleus, in which the production of NA increases in response to CRH stimulation. The NA produced there increases the sympathetic system\u2019s activity and reduces parasympathetic activity [15,16]. Additionally, attention should be paid to the fact that two important biogenic amines, NA and 5-HT, have their own receptors on the platelet surface and are involved in the platelet aggregation process (Figure 1) [17].

This allowed the researchers to hypothesize that the use of drugs modulating the concentrations of 5-HT and NA may affect not only the number of platelets, but also their ability to aggregate [18,19]. One such drug is VEN. Scientists have repeatedly pointed out the effect of drugs used in treating mental disorders on the number and activity of platelets. Such drugs include antipsychotics such as olanzapine or clozapine, which, apart from affecting the process of platelet aggregation, also affect their number, which can cause thrombocytopenia [20\u201322]. Other drugs that can significantly affect the platelet count are mood stabilizers, such as valproic acid [23] or lithium salts [24]. In our work, we present the case of VEN being added to therapy for a patient suffering from ET and MDD and consider the rarely reported effect of VEN lowering the platelet count. Figure 1.

Materials and Methods In this publication, we describe the case of a 71-year-old patient suffering from MDD coexisting with ET. The retrospective case report uses data from the inpatient treatment conducted by three of the authors. The patient\u2019s data were anonymized for this report. The patient was informed about the mechanism of action of VEN and its potential adverse effects; fully informed consent from the patient was obtained. We also prepare a narrative review of literature about the effect of VEN on platelet count and activity. To prepare this review, databases were reviewed to isolate reports according to the following key phrases: \u201cvenlafaxine\u201d, \u201cSNRI\u201d, \u201cplatelets\u201d, \u201cplatelet count\u201d, and \u201cessential thrombocythemia\u201d. Publications published in 1997\u20132021 were taken into account. 3. Case Study A 71-year-old patient was brought urgently by her family to the Clinical Department of Psychiatry in Tarnowskie G\u00f3ry of the Medical University of Silesia. During the psychiatric examination in the emergency department, she had clearly pronounced anxiety and fear; she expressed reference, nihilistic, and sometimes catastrophic delusions; and she gave the impression that she was having auditory hallucinations. On admission, psychomotor retardation and depression of mood, of significant intensity, were also noticed. She required emergency pharmacotherapy and received 5 mg of diazepam and 2 mg of haloperidol. Later in the study, she was a bit calmer, but still suffered from severe psychomotor retardation and significant depression of mood. She was reluctant to make verbal contact\u2014the statements were sparse, she answered the questions asked with single, short sentences, and psychotic symptoms still persisted. Because of these symptoms, she was admitted to the department with the diagnosis of a severe episode of depression with psychotic symptoms in the course of recurrent depressive disorder, according to The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). The family reports showed that in the few months before hospitalization, her mental state was gradually deteriorating. Symptoms such as decreasing mood and psychomotor drive, deterioration of purposeful activity, sleep disorders, difficulty in focusing, and deterioration in cognitive functions, particularly memory disorders, appeared. Three days before admission, the family observed a significant deterioration of the mental state. Additional symptoms began to appear, such as mutism, akinesia, and limited responses to stimuli. According to the family, the intensity of verbal production with delusional content increased. Both the family and the patient on admission denied episodes of mania and hypomania in the past. The analysis of the disease course indicated many years of psychiatric history. The patient was hospitalized twice in the past due to recurrent depressive disorder 17 and 18 years before the present hospitalization. Since her last hospital discharge, she had not experienced any exacerbations of disease symptoms requiring hospital treatment, but she was under constant outpatient psychiatric care. Psychopharmacological therapy prescribed before admission consisted of 45 mg of mirtazapine per day, 20 mg of citalopram per day, and 7.5 mg of zopiclone as needed. For 6 years, she had been under the control of a hematology clinic due to ET. She confirmed the presence of the Jak V617F 12.5\u201331% mutation. Because of this, she was taking 1 mg of anagrelide per day in two divided doses. The last modification of hematological treatment was made 4 months before hospitalization. The patient was also treated for hypertension for many years before hospitalization, and without any changes in the period before hospitalization, she took indapamide at a dose of 1.5 mg per day and 50 mg of metoprolol per day. On admission to the hospital, the current treatment was modified. In the beginning, constantly admitted by the patient before hospitalization, citalopram was reduced and then, within 5 days, was discontinued due to its ineffectiveness in out-of-hospital treatment. Due to psychotic symptoms, haloperidol at a daily dose of 8 mg was added to the treatment, but because of persistent psychotic experiences, it was discontinued on the seventh day Medicina 2022, 58, 626 4 of 8 of hospitalization. Instead, olanzapine was included in the treatment at an initial dose of 5 mg per day to reach a dose of 10 mg after 10 days. Because of the reduction in the intensity of psychotic experiences and persistent depressive symptoms on the 29th day of hospitalization, VEN was added to the current treatment at the initial dose of 37.5 mg. Due to the good clinical response, the dose was increased to 75 mg per day after 5 days. After 10 days, the dose of VEN was increased to 112.5 mg per day, but due to increased anxiety, the dose was reduced to 75 mg after 3 days. After 20 days, the dose was increased again to 112.5 mg per day, and after another 6 days, to 150 mg. After 92 days of VEN treatment, the dose was changed to 225 mg, which was maintained until the end of the observation period. The diagnosis and the medical history were objectified after achieving a relative improvement in the mental state. The patient then admitted to the presence of episodes of hypomania in the past, which, due to the fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria according to ICD-10, resulted in the diagnosis being changed to bipolar disorder. On the 76th day of hospitalization, aripiprazole was added to the treatment at an initial dose of 2.5 mg; after 7 days, the dose was increased to 5 mg per day. During hospitalization, the hypertensive treatment was slightly modified due to persistently high blood pressure values. On day 22, 5 mg of perindopril was added to the treatment, and this dosage was increased to 10 mg per day on day 40. The dosage of anagrelide was not modified throughout the observation period in accordance with the recommendations of the hematologist with whom the patient consulted several times during hospitalization. However, due to his recommendations, the patient\u2019s platelet count was regularly monitored by performing a complete blood count. Since VEN was added to the therapy, a gradual reduction in the number of platelets was observed. The intensity of this reduction was also dependent on the dose of VEN. Detailed changes in platelet count over time and their dependence on VEN dosing are shown in Figure 2. Medicina 2022, 58, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of treatment, but because of persistent psychotic experiences, it was discontinued on the seventh day of hospitalization. Instead, olanzapine was included in the treatment at an initial dose of 5 mg per day to reach a dose of 10 mg after 10 days.

Due to the good clinical response, the dose was increased to 75 mg per day after 5 days. After 10 days, the dose of VEN was increased 112.5 mg per day, but due to increased anxiety, the dose was reduced to 75 mg after days. After 20 days, the dose was increased again to 112.5 mg per day, and after another 6 days, to 150 mg.

Detailed changes in platelet count over time and their dependence on VEN dosing are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Relationship between platelet count and venlafaxine (VEN) treatment duration and dosage. On the 139th day of hospitalization, lithium salts were included in the pharmacotherapy because of the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, significant improvement in mood, and reduction in depressive symptoms. 3 Figure 2. Relationship between platelet count and venlafaxine (VEN) treatment duration and dosage. On the 139th day of hospitalization, lithium salts were included in the pharmacotherapy because of the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, significant improvement in mood, and reduction in depressive symptoms. The case report focuses on the treatment period from the initiation of hospitalization to the 139th day of observation due to reports in the literature that lithium salts can significantly affect the platelet count [24] and interfere with previous observations. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 5 of 8 4. Discussion Thrombocytopenia is an adverse effect that we can observe after administering many drug groups. We can also find many examples of antidepressants that may inhibit the formation of blood platelets or intensify their destruction in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and the spleen, which reduce their number in the blood [25\u201327]. However, one of the most frequently described mechanisms of platelet destruction is the mechanism that supports the increased production of anti-platelet antibodies, which is stimulated by the drugs taken [28]. One of the clinical studies that proved such an effect of antidepressant drugs is a study prepared by Song HR. et al., in which a reduction in platelet count was observed in patients receiving escitalopram or VEN, and such dependence was not observed in patients using bupropion (which belongs to the group of inhibitors of the dopamine and adrenergic receptor) [29]. It is also noteworthy that in this study, there was a stronger correlation between the use of the drug and a decrease in platelet count in the case of escitalopram than in the case of VEN, which may suggest greater importance for the inhibition of serotonergic over noradrenergic transmission. Similar conclusions were drawn from a meta-analysis carried out in 2013, which included a group of 681 patients from two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in which the safety of using another SNRI representative, duloxetine, was tested. Conclusions resulting from this meta-analysis show that in the group of patients taking duloxetine compared to the placebo group, a decrease in the number of platelets was observed [30]. The reverse relationship is shown in the study prepared by Gronau W. et al., in which a statistically significant increase in the platelet number after using VEN was visible [31]. Due to the presence of \u000b2-adrenergic and 5HT-2A receptors on the surface of the platelets, it may be assumed that the effects of biogenic amine concentrations, such as NA and 5-HT, will be influenced by the platelet aggregation process. These assumptions were confirmed by an in vitro study conducted in 2012, which showed a statistically significant increase in the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen after using VEN. Nevertheless, in this study, this effect did not result in an extension of the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time [32]. Despite the effect of SNRI described in the cited studies, the extent, and activity of platelets, their influence on the risk of bleeding, and the risk of cardiovascular events caused by their overactivity are still very unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the first report on the impact of VEN on the platelet aggregation process dates back to 2006. In the case study prepared by Sarma A. et al. regarding a patient in whom the administration of VEN caused the appearance of ecchymoses, the authors confirmed disorders of platelet aggregation, which they associated with the patient\u2019s intake of VEN [33]. Similar symptoms were later described by Shaligram D. et al. in a patient taking desvenlafaxine [34]. These case reports prompted the researchers to conduct studies on larger groups of patients that assessed this previously unknown effect of SNRIs. In a study conducted on a group of 4136 patients after coronary artery bypass grafting, there was no relationship between patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or SNRI before the procedure and the risk of excessive bleeding during the postoperative period and during longer follow-up. The same study showed a reduction in the risk of cardiac death, which, according to the authors, was probably related to the reduction in platelet activity [35]. Similar conclusions were drawn from a study by Smith MM et al. in a group of 1453 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were taking SSRI or SNRI. An increased risk of bleeding and postoperative mortality was also not observed in the study [36]. A study prepared by Chachal P. et al. also did not reveal an increased risk of bleeding in patients receiving SNRI after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [37]. On the other hand, in a group of patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) who used SSRI and SNRI, a statistically significantly more frequent occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed compared to patients not using these drugs [38,39]. Medicina 2022, 58, 626 6 of 8 However, even the authors of this article highlight the important role of antidepressant therapy using SSRI or SNRI in this group of patients [40,41] and are not in favor of stopping it. The case report prepared by us has some limitations. The most important limitation is polypharmacotherapy taken by the patient, which could interfere with the decrease in the number of platelets observed by us. However, to limit the impact of other drugs, in this article, we only present the period when the only modification of the therapy was the intensification of VEN doses. The second limitation is the initial misdiagnosis of MDD with bipolar disorder, which influenced the initial therapeutic decisions. However, this resulted from the patient\u2019s serious condition on admission and from the fact that both the patient and the family denied the occurrence of hypomania episodes in the past. 5. Conclusions Considering the results of scientific studies and the changes in the platelet count observed in the described patient, attention should be paid to the possible adverse effect of reducing the number of platelets in the group of patients taking VEN. Due to the probable mechanisms of this phenomenon, it is an adverse effect seemingly difficult to prevent in the case of chronic therapy. Therefore, ordering frequent complete blood count lab tests in such patients should be justified to detect it as early as possible and consider the further course of treatment. However, this topic requires further research to unambiguously determine the effect of SNRI on platelet count and activity.

ABSTRACT Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used to treat various diseases and has anticancer effects that suppress metastases in animal models of sarcoma and melanoma. However, these effects have been observed in a limited number of clinical cases. We report the case of a patient with metastatic breast cancer in which long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in the absence of salvage chemotherapy. The patient was treated with IVIG for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Surprisingly, the lung and brain metastases were stabilized, and the patient achieved a progression-free interval of 29 months. More cases are needed to investigate and confirm the efficacy of IVIG in solid tumors in the future.

ITP results in autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets in the spleen. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is derived from donor plasma and contains purified immunoglobulin G (IgG). IVIG is used to treat various diseases, including immunodeficiency, as well as autoimmune, systemic inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disorders [2]. IVIG exhibits anticancer effects that suppress metastases in several animal models [3,4]. However, these effects were observed in a limited number of patients, including a case report and a clinical study of metastatic melanoma [5,6] and a case report of soft tissue sarcoma [7]. Here, we report that long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease progression in a patient with advanced breast cancer with lung and brain metastases in the absence of salvage breast cancer therapy.

(pT1N0M0, stage I; Figure 1). Figure 2 summarizes the entire clinical course, treatment, and response of the patient. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epithelial growth factor receptor were negative. She underwent breast conservation surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil. She received three cycles of chemotherapy, and thrombocytopenia developed after the second cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count,16,000/ \u00b5L) persisted and became refractory to platelet transfusion after the third cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, the patient had severe menorrhagia. As a result, adjuvant chemotherapy was discontinued, and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected. However, the platelet count did not recover to baseline during the 6-month follow-up. Bone marrow biopsy and all pertinent laboratory studies were normal except for a positive antiplatelet antibody test; therefore, a clinical diagnosis of ITP was established. Eltrombopag (25 mg daily), hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and danazol were administered, but the response was limited. Splenectomy was not considered because of the high risk of bleeding. Subsequently, she did not receive any cancer treatment. The patient developed lung metastases with a diameter of 1 cm in the right lower lobe (Figure 3) and tiny subpleural nodules in the right middle lobe 28 months after the operation. Six months later, the patient suffered from severe vertigo, headache, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance  Figure 1. Contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging.

Brain metastases were confirmed radiologically. Whole-brain radiotherapy was administered (14 fractions of 3500 mGy) in March 2019. The sizes of the brain metastases were all regressed (with the largest size of approximately 1.3 cm) (Figure 4B). For refractory ITP and a high risk of bleeding, the patient began to receive IVIGs at a dosage of 0.4 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Her platelet count recovered to approximately 100,000/\u00b5L in subsequent cycles of IVIG therapy. Notably, the lung metastases slightly decreased half a year after the initiation of IVIG (all of them less than 1 cm) (Figure 3). Moreover, in further repeated imaging studies, metastatic breast cancer in the brain and lungs remained stable without new metastatic lesions for 29 months (Figures 3 and 4). No side effects from IVIG therapy were reported, and the patient maintained a normal life. During the course, the patient did not receive palliative chemotherapy or targeted therapy for breast cancer.  DISCUSSION Of all subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer has the worst prognosis and the highest likelihood of recurrence. Published data suggest that metastatic triple-negative breast cancer has a median survival of approximately 1 year [8] and a 5-year survival rate of 12% [9]. This is the first known case of sustained tumor stabilization from IVIG treatment alone in an advanced triple-negative breast cancer patient with lung and brain metastases. Without any anticancer therapy, IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer and metastases in the lungs and brain. This therapy provided a prolonged progressionfree survival time of at least 29 months in our patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This extraordinary outcome suggests that IVIG may be an alternative therapy for breast cancer. Clinical experience with IVIG for patients with cancer is scarce, but beneficial antimetastatic effects have been described in several animal studies [5-7,10]. In mouse models of melanoma and sarcoma, the administration of IVIG significantly inhibited cancer progression and prolonged survival [10]. A similar effect was reported in a mouse model of sarcoma [7]. Recently, Xu et al. [11] demonstrated that low-dose IgG might induce macrophage polarization toward the M1 profile, and it was effective in suppressing tumor progression in mouse models of three cancer types (melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer). https://ejbc.kr  https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8  255  \fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer  A  B  C  D  Figure 4.

The red arrows indicated the metastatic brain lesions. MR = magnetic resonance; IVIG = intravenous immunoglobulin; WBRT = whole brain radiotherapy.  The antimetastatic effects and safety of IVIG have been reported. In one case report, a patient with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor received IVIG (0.4 g/kg) once every 6 weeks for multiple sclerosis and had a stable disease status for 30 months [7]. In another case report, a patient with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) experienced liver metastasis regression and stabilization of lung metastases for 9 months [5]. In a third report, nine patients with metastatic melanoma who failed prior chemotherapy and immunotherapy were treated with IVIG therapy (1 g/kg) every 3 weeks [6]. Two of the patients achieved stable disease status for 3 and 8 months, respectively, but the metastases progressed thereafter. To our knowledge, no other clinical reports have illustrated the substantial antimetastatic effect of IVIG therapy on solid tumors. In our case, a patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving only IVIG therapy achieved stable disease status for more than 2 years. This indicates that IVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage cancer and has great potential for metastatic solid tumor treatment. https://ejbc.kr  https://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8  256  \fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer  The mechanisms by which IVIG inhibits metastasis progression are multifactorial and not fully understood. IVIG may halt tumor progression by inducing tumor cell apoptosis [4,12]. IVIG was observed to enhance the apoptotic gene expression of p53, p21, and pRb in cancer cells and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation [3]. IVIG also induces interleukin-12 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 secretion, which potentiates natural killer cell activity and increases anticancer effects. Antiangiogenic effects and activity against tumor adhesion machinery have also been proposed [10]. IVIG protects the basement membrane and intercellular matrix integrity and prevents cell invasion by decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-9 mRNA expression and protein levels [7]. F(ab')2 fragments from IVIG have an affinity for binding to cancer cells and initiating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity [13]. Dom\u00ednguez-Soto et al. observed that the dissemination of tumors depends on tumor-associated macrophages (M2), and IVIG could inhibit this process by modulating cytokines and inducing M2 (protumoral)-to-M1 (antitumoral) polarization [14]. The current study showed that IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer and metastases in the lungs and brain without any anticancer therapy, except for whole-brain radiotherapy. Although whole-brain radiotherapy may have contributed to the progression of brain metastases, it is noteworthy that a previous study reported that the intracranial progression-free duration was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5\u20138.5 months) in patients with multiple brain metastases [15]. Furthermore, the median survival after a diagnosis of brain metastases in patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy was 3.6 months (95% CI, 1.5\u20138.9 months) [16]. In another retrospective study, the median survival for patients with brain metastases who received whole-brain radiotherapy was 4.2 months [17]. Consequently, the improved survival might not be entirely attributable to wholebrain radiotherapy. It is possible that both IVIG and whole-brain radiotherapy provided a synergistic or additive effect on the stabilization of brain metastases. The effect of IVIG therapy and radiation therapy on brain metastases should be considered in further long-term follow-up studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In conclusion, we report the first case of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and brain that was incidentally stabilized by IVIG treatment. The administration of IVIG may play a role in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis with few side effects in patients with solid tumors.  REFERENCES 1. Kistangari G, McCrae KR.

ABSTRACT Background/Significance: Catatonia is common in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis (Espinola-Nadurille, 2019). The glutamate NMDAR antagonists amantadine and memantine are effective in catatonia (Beach, 2017), but data on their use in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is limited. We describe three patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis treated with NMDAR antagonists and propose a possible mechanism underlying differential outcomes. Case 1: A 20-year-old woman presented with catatonic symptoms after successful treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with immunotherapy and salpingo-oopherectomy for ovarian teratoma. Initial Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score was 22. Lorazepam 2.5 mg three times daily was partially effective, but increased doses caused sedation. Memantine was titrated to 10 mg twice daily with complete resolution of catatonia over two weeks. Case 2: A 26-year-old woman presented with catatonic with BFCRS score of 25, after successful immunotherapy for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Lorazepam 2 mg four times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused respiratory depression. Memantine 10 mg daily resulted in further improvement. Lorazepam titration to 4 mg four times daily was then possible, with complete resolution of catatonia over two weeks. Case 3: A 31-year-old woman with anti-NMDAR encephalitis presented with catatonic symptoms with BFCRS score of 22, after a hospital course significant for limited response to immunotherapy with persistently elevated serum anti-NMDAR antibody titers. Lorazepam 2 mg three times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused sedation. Both amantadine 100 mg twice daily and memantine 10 mg were trialed but were discontinued due to agitation. Mutism and negativism persisted, with a discharge BFCRS score of 12. Discussion: Memantine was effective for catatonia and well tolerated in two patients with successfully treated anti-NMDAR encephalitis, but both amantadine and memantine caused agitation in a third patient with active disease. NMDARs are reversibly internalized in the presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies, leading to a compensatory increase in downstream glutamatergic tone. We hypothesize that NMDAR reemergence after successful treatment, in the context of excess extracellular glutamate, creates a state of excitotoxicity contributing to catatonic signs for which NMDAR blockade can be effective. In the third case, where NMDARs presumably remained internalized in the presence of persistent anti-NMDAR antibodies and a state of NMDAR hypofunction persisted, further NMDAR blockade caused clinical worsening. Conclusion/Implications: NMDAR antagonists can be safe and effective in patients with residual catatonia following successful treatment of anti-NMDAR encephalitis but may be less useful during active disease. More work is needed to clarify best practices for patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis. References: 1. Espinola-Nadurille M, Flores-Rivera J, Rivas-Alonso V, et al.

In the present research, we reported an acute myeloid leukemia subject. The patient was treated with Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6, and Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3. During treatment, the patient suffered from 3 life-threatening complications caused by chemotherapy drugs include sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), refractory thrombocytopenia, and pericardial effusion with pericardiocentesis limitation. To this end, we tried three novel approaches for patient management by Corticosteroid and Colchicine. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective in thrombocytopenia. However, eltrombopag (25 mg/kg/d) response was dramatic. Moreover, pericardial effusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed with Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d); meanwhile, the massive pericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed with Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) through the mentioned treatment. Fortunately, these approaches were effective and life-saving.

Received: September 08, 2020; Accepted: March 08, 2022  AML is treated via a highly potent chemotherapy regimen with severe complications. Its treatment complications could affect the main organs, including bone marrow, heart, liver, and kidney. The limitation of access to new drugs, in other words,  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  their unavailability in low- or middle-income countries, is known to be a challenge for pediatric oncologists.2 Critical conditions, such as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, steatosis, and pseudocirrhosis, are more commonly associated with chemotherapy. It is important to anticipate and recognize these adverse effects so that appropriate clinical measures could be taken. Patients with these liver manifestations can be normally managed with supportive therapies and Defibrotide. Liver toxicity may also be resolved after discontinuation of chemotherapy. 3 Defibrotide is unavailable in Iran. Refractory thrombocytopenia limits many invasive procedures in oncologic patients, such as surgical operation or biopsy and other therapeutic or diagnostic actions. In this article, we solved three challenges of treatment employing new alternative treatment options.  Case Presentation Our subject was a four year-old male patient from Iran presenting pancytopenia, who was admitted to Shahid Madani hospital (Khoramabad in Lorestan province/Iran). There was no history of any hematological disorders. On examination, the patient had pallor and mild splenic enlargement, measuring 1.5 cm on the left below  the costal margin. Lymphadenopathy or any abnormal physical findings were unremarkable. The patient had been suffering from prolonged fever and nocturnal sweats along with weakness and fatigue. Morphology and immunophenotyping peripheral blood cells were examined with an automated hematologic analyzer (Sysmex, XE-5000, Vienna, Austria). Peripheral blood smear examination showed normocytic normochromic red blood cells, including a few nucleated red blood cells. White blood cells showed shift to the left with a significant number of myeloid blast cells. Several giant platelets and platelet aggregates were seen. The leukocyte differential count was eosinophils 3%, lymphocytes 70%, and neutrophils 27%, and band forms 1%. Coagulation tests indicated a prolonged prothrombin time of 16.3 sec (reference range, 10.2 to 13.8), a normal activated partial Thromboplastin time, normal fibrinogen, and an increased D-dimer concentration of 4.96 mg/mL (reference range, 0 to 0.35). Bone marrow smears were stained with Wright-Giemsa and analyzed according to the routine clinical laboratory procedures. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed an increased abnormal megakaryocytic. Monolobated and multinucleated megakaryocytic with hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei were  Figure 1. Left side shows myeloblast in peripheral blood in Wright-Giemsa staining (\u00d7 100) and right side (\u00d7 10).  557  Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  also seen, which showed that the myeloblast cells (Figure 1) were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34, CD14, CD71, CD117, MPO, HLA-DR, CD3, CD15, CD235a, and human leukocyte antigenDR. The biochemical parameters, namely uric acid, bilirubin, creatinine, and liver enzymes, were normal. Serum LDH was highly increased. The diagnosis was confirmed as AML-M4. Cytogenetic study of bone marrow myeloblasts showed t (8,21). The patient was critically ill due to a high pulmonary pressure and respiratory distress. First echocardiography showed a high pulmonary pressure and a small amount of pericardial effusion. Lasix and Sildenafil were started for the patient. Based on this diagnosis and concerning the patient\u2019s severely compromised overall condition, we started the therapy with Dutch-Belgian pediatric AML protocol for children with newly diagnosed AML: First course: Ara-C Idarubicin Etoposide Thioguanin (AIET) induction 6-Thioguanin 100 mg/m2 orally every 12 hours on days 1, 2, 3, 4. Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4; Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4; Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6;  Triple intrathecal with Ara-C and MTX and Hydrocortisone was injected based on ageadjusted instruction. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Second course: Ara-C Mitoxantrone (AM) induction Cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day as continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3; Triple intrathecal injection similar to the first induction course. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Consolidation therapy Cytarabine 2 g/m2 every 12 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3 (a total of six doses); Etoposide 100 mg/m 2 as a 60-minute IV infusion on days 2, 3, 4, 5; Triple intrathecal injection similar to the first and second induction courses. Age-adjusted dose; see table triple IT doses in the paragraph. Following the first chemotherapy course, the patient was involved in refractory thrombocytopenia. Frequent infusion of the random donor or single donor apheresis platelets were done, but platelet count was sometimes greater than 20000. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective. After the second chemotherapy course, we treated him with eltrombopag (EP) (25 mg/kg/d). Furthermore, following the initiation of  Figure 2. Left side shows cardiomegaly due to pericardial effusion and right side shows decreasing effusion after prednisolone and Colchicine.

Pericardial effusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed via Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d). Nevertheless, massive pericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed using Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) with the mentioned treatment (Figure 2). After the third chemotherapy courses, the total and direct bilirubin increased, but transaminases were normal. Moderate Pitting edema and ascites were found in the patient. The liver looked large on examination. Serum albumin ranged from 2.5 to 3.5. Hepatic color Doppler sonography was normal. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) were suggested based on Baltimore criteria, but the liver biopsy was not done. The morning after the initiation of HDMT (Day +13), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin were elevated to 459 U/L, 199 U/L, and 2.4 g/dL, respectively. Prothrombin time was further prolonged (16.5 seconds; INR=1.56). BUN was 3 mg/dL and Cr 0.4 mg/ dL. On the morning of Day +14, serum AST, ALT, total bilirubin, BUN, and Cr were 1108 U/L, 489 U/L, 2.9 g/ dL, 5 mg/dL, and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively. By Day +15, serum AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin had risen to 1494 U/L, 781 U/L, 3.4 g/dL, and 1.51 g/dL, respectively. Thereafter, the patient\u2019s condition improved gradually. One week later (Day +20), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin returned to 91 U/L, 197 U/L, and 1.4 g/dL, respectively. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Defibrotide is the standard treatment for hepatic VOD; however, this drug was not available in Iran. We treated him with an alternative protocol as follows: Methyl prednisolone pulse (30 mg/kg/d for three days) and UDCA (20 mg/kg/d) The Ethics Committee of the Lorestan University of Medical Sciences approved the present case presentation (Ethics Code: IR.LUMS.REC.1400.304). Written informed consent was received from the patient. 559  Discussion Cytoreductive chemotherapy regimen in AML causes certain life-threatening complications, such as refractory thrombocytopenia, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and cardiovascular problems. Therefore, using the classic treatment of these challenges face limitations in the Iranian AML patients. Defibrotide is believed to be one of effective drugs for SOS, which is not available in Iran. Moreover, the use of eltrombopag in AML patients is accompanied with a high risk of disease progression. Thrombocytopenia in AML is a life-threatening problem with a few treatment options. Platelet transfusions are limited by alloimmunization. Frequent transfusion of ABO-mismatched platelets leads to early platelet refractoriness. ABO-mismatched platelets are as effective as matched platelets in patients with low-titer isoagglutinins, such as oncologic patients or those requiring only a few transfusions. However, the greater incidence of early refractoriness induced in major mismatched group (MMG) patients indicates that ABO-mismatched platelets should not be given to patients with marrow failure requiring a long-term support.4 Concerning our patient, ABO-mismatched platelet was probably transfused due to the situation. Furthermore, Rituximab, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are new treatment strategies for severe HLA alloimmune platelet refractoriness. These options can overcome severe platelet refractoriness owing to polyspecific HLA alloimmunization.5 Our patient received IVIg without any response. We did not have any time for weekly Rituximab efficacy. EP is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist, which increases platelet counts and has preclinical antileukemic activity. In 2015, multi-center, randomized, placebocontrolled, trial patients aged 18 years or older, received EP doses up to 300 mg on a daily basis. There was an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.6 The treatment with EP results in a reduction in free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  dose-dependent manner. Increased intracellular iron eliminates the antiproliferative and induction effects of EP cell differentiation. Its antileukemic effects have been shown to be mediated by changes in the amount of intracellular iron.7 EP is also a safe and effective therapy for refractory thrombocytopenia after haplo-HSCT.8 It could reduce platelet transfusion requirements in thrombocytopenic patients with advanced MDS and AML. EP might also be a treatment option for thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS, who are ineligible for other treatments and are not receiving disease-modifying treatment EP as escalated dose from 50 mg daily up to 200 mg daily up to 200 mg daily well-tolerated and has modest responses in heavily treated, predominantly higher-risk MDS patients or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or AML after HMA failure.9 Another use of EP in leukemia settings is in the treatment of severe refractory thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CML),10 and in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) secondary to chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (CLL).11 Therefore, we did not worry about leukemia relapse during the drug use. We treated our patient with dose 1 mg/kg/d because of the cost of drug. In addition, we utilized Prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/d for a synergistic effect as a synergistic drug. In 2016, a number of newly diagnosed AML patients aged >60 years (yrs) with ECOG scores of 0-2, no active second malignancy, and no evidence of marrow fibrosis at the time of AML diagnosis were treated with anthracycline (daunorubicin at 45_mg/m2 or Idarubicin at 12 mg/m2 x 3 days) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2 \u00d7 7 days). Eltrombopag was administered and started from day 15. This study suggested that eltrombopag can accelerate platelet recovery, potentially reduce platelet transfusions, and increase complete remission rate (CR) in older AML patients.12 Regarding our patient, we did not detect any signs of relapse during eltrombopag administration. Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  Nonetheless, in 2019, Dr. Frey reported that eltrombopag in combination with induction of chemotherapy in patients with AML did not have favorable outcomes.13 Despite this report, we should have used this drug herein since other treatments, such as platelet transfusion and IVIg, were not efficacious. Hepatic VOD, also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), rapidly progresses and involves life-threatening complications that can occur in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or bone marrow transplantation after heavy chemotherapy regimens. K+-sparing diuretic, low protein diet, and non-absorbable oral antibiotics are the general strategies for the management of this situation. Hepatic VOD or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is one of the adverse effects of chemotherapy drugs or severe combined chemotherapy regimens. Chemotherapy-induced Sinusoidal Injury (CSI) score is a tool used as an immunohistochemical panel consisting of CD34, SMA, and GS. It may serve as an objective marker of chemotherapyinduced sinusoidal injury and could be conducive to diagnosis of this peculiar form of liver injury. Unfortunately, due to severe thrombocytopenia, pediatric gastrointestinal service rejects liver biopsy. Platelet transfusions should be limited as much as possible because repeated platelet transfusion increases the risk of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction. This was not possible in our patient because there was a risk of life-threatening bleeding due to severe thrombocytopenia. Properly assessing fluid and electrolyte balance may be difficult due to the accumulation of ascites during SOS. In these cases, aggressive treatment with diuretics should be avoided due to the severe reduction in effective intravascular volume, which is prone to accumulation of sludge in the liver sinusoids. Defibrotide is now the first-line therapy IV during the first 17-21 days.14 However, Defibrotide is not available in Iran and our patient had a life-threatening situation. In 2008, Lun Chen and colleagues reported a case of rhabdomyosarcoma in a 21-month-old 560  \fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.  boy who developed pancytopenia, dyspnea, jaundice, massive ascites, and body weight gain of more than 10% after receiving conventional chemotherapy. Hepatic VOD was diagnosed. He recovered after supportive care and treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone. He was diagnosed with VOD based on the abovementioned findings, and Solumedrol was administered (15 mg/kg, every 12 hours for six doses).15 In addition, the third challenging problem in our patient was the combination of severe thrombocytopenia and masssive pericardial effusion, which required pericardiocentesis, but due to severe thrombocytopenia, needle aspiration was not possible in this patient. Severe thrombocytopenia limited needle aspiration through the pericardium. Therefore, we had to treat our patient with medication. Moreover, there was counterindication concerning ASA and other NSAIDs in our case. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent used to treat gout and Beh\u00c1et's disease. In gout, it is less preferred to NSAIDs or steroids. Some of its other uses include the prevention of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever. Recent studies have reported that it is effective in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. In our patient, we administered a combination of prednisone (2 mg/kg/d) and Colchicine (0.5 mg/d). In 2013, Colchicine was used (at a dose of 0.5 mg) twice daily for 3 months for adult patients with acute pericarditis weighing >70 kg and 0.5 mg once a day for those weighing \u226470 kg. These patients treated with Colchicine added to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy, significantly reduced the rate of incessant or recurrent pericarditis.16 Experience with colchicine in the treatment of malignant pericardial effusion in solid tumors is relatively extensive, but experience with the use of this drug in the management of pericardial effusion due to leukemia is very limited. It is not a routine treatment. Colchicine was administered as an adjunctive therapy after pericardiocentesis and not as a primary treatment. 561  In patients with malignant pericardial effusion who underwent pericardiocentesis, the use of Colchicine was associated with less all-cause mortality and reduced the need for subsequent interventions. In our patient, we only used drug therapy without pericardiocentesis. Colchicine should be frequently administered in patients with adhesions and constriction after initial catheter drainage. Subsequently, the course of high-dose steroid should continue Colchicine for 4 months in order to prevent constriction.17 The concomitant occurrence of sinus obstruction syndrome (SOS) and refractory and severe thrombocytopenia, which requires repeated platelet transfusions, is a challenging and dangerous dilemma for the oncologist because repeated platelet transfusion cause platelets accumulation in the liver to repair sinusoidal cell damage, and these conditions creates critical and dangerous conditions for the patient while receiving myeloablative chemotherapeutic agents caused by SOS. This phenomenon also act as a platelet sequestration place. Endothelial protective therapy or antiplatelet therapy, such as ASA, may be helpful in treating SOS. However, antiplatelet therapy had counterindication in our patient due to severe thrombocytopenia, but the treatment of endothelial inflammation of the liver sinusoids with a steroid pulse could facilitate the management of SOS in the absence of the drug of choice (defibrothyde) and save the patient's life.18 The interaction between Colchicine and platelet function was another challenge in this patient. Colchicine may have a beneficial cardiovascular effect by targeting the platelet-inflammatory axis. Whether targeting this pathway in vivo can offer protection from atherothrombosis without increasing the bleeding risk observed with traditional platelet-directed therapies remains unknown, for which future investigation is required.19  Conclusion In acute myeloid leukemia drugs, the sideeffects are known to be a big challenge for oncologists. In developing countries, the use of Middle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563  \fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia  alternative therapies in the management of these complications instead of expensive and unattainable drugs is one of the most innovative treatment options for patients. The most important advantage of this solution is its cost-effectiveness and high efficacy. Steroids in various doses, along with Colchicine, have a life-saving role in improving the life-threatening side-effects of drugs in the liver (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome), heart (pericarditis), and bone marrow (transfusion-associated GVHD) of cancer patients.  7.  8.  9.

The Effectiveness of Microdosed Psilocybin in the Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Lyme Disease: A Case Study. International Medical Case Reports Journal. 2023;16:109-15 on 11 Jul 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from The United States of America and concerns a 51-year-old male patient who experienced a serious adverse drug reaction of Herxheimer reaction with panic attacks associated with azithromycin and atovaquone. The patient is immunocompetent, currently 70-year-old diagnosed with polymicrobial tick-borne infections: neuroborreliosis, babesiosis, and bartonellosis. His predominant symptoms were neuropsychiatric. The patient was not responding to antimicrobial or psychotropic pharmaceuticals, but symptoms remitted when treated with low intermittent doses of Psilocybin, micro-dosing. This patient was well until the age of 46 when he experienced the acute onset of fever, rigors, drenching sweats, and myalgias. These symptoms lasted three days and then recurred weekly for the next two weeks. Physical examination was significant for splenomegaly, and laboratory tests were positive for acute Lyme disease (in September 1996). He was not aware of a tick attachment or a rash; he lived in eastern Massachusetts. Treatment was begun with oral doxycycline, and the recurrent febrile episodes were remitted, but he subsequently developed severe insomnia and anxiety. Over the next ten months, he was on continuous antibiotics with oral doxycycline, clarithromycin, or cefuroxime, either alone or in combination. In addition to insomnia and anxiety, he complained of myalgias, neck pain, and drenching night sweats. He stopped antibiotics because there was no apparent benefit in his mood or physical symptoms. He did not have a family history of psychiatric illness, had no prior history of mood disorder, and had not experienced a stressful event that might precipitate mood issues. Five years after the onset of his illness he was diagnosed with babesiosis with PCR positivity (October 2001).

The pathogenesis of  neuropsychiatric Lyme disease is associated with autoimmune induced neuroinflammation. This case report describes an immuno\u0002competent male with serologically positive neuropsychiatric Lyme disease who did not tolerate antimicrobial or psychotropic  medications and whose symptoms remitted when he began psilocybin in microdosed (sub-hallucinogenic) amounts. A literature  review of its therapeutic benefits reveals that psilocybin is both serotonergic and anti-inflammatory and therefore may offer significant  therapeutic benefits to patients with mental illness secondary to autoimmune inflammation. The role of microdosed psilocybin in the  treatment of neuropsychiatric Lyme disease and autoimmune encephalopathies warrants further study.  Keywords: Lyme, neuroinflammation, psychedelic, psilocybin, microdose, mental illness, autoimmune, encephalopathy Introduction Lyme borreliosis is an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl). These bacteria are transmitted by  Ixodes ticks and can generate multisystem complaints. Persistent infection, resulting in chronic neurological symptoms, is  well documented.1\u20138 It is now appreciated that chronic infection with Bbsl can cause a host of psychiatric issues, and that  neuropsychiatric complaints, particularly anxiety and depression, may dominate the clinical picture. In addition, chronic  Lyme neuroborreliosis has been linked to eating disorders, addiction syndromes, violence, anhedonia, depersonalization,  dissociative episodes, suicide, and illnesses that look like schizoaffective disorders and bipolar disease.9\u201316 The neurological manifestations of Lyme disease are often complicated by co-infections, other microbes that are  additionally transmitted by Ixodes ticks and exacerbate the clinical picture. In particular, Bartonella spp. are associated  with a wide range of mental health disorders including anxiety, panic disorder, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder  (OCD), phobias, eating disorders, alcohol and drug abuse, psychosis and personality disorders.17\u201321 Other tick-borne  microbes including Babesia and Mycoplasma spp. may also engender mental health issues.22\u201329 The pathophysiology of mental health disorders as a result of these infections may be a result of multiple mechan\u0002isms. While neuroborreliosis can be caused by infection of the central nervous system or vascular disruption, most often  it is associated with neuroinflammation from infection outside the nervous system. Persistent infection with Bbsl can  result in the production of anti-neuronal antibodies and autoimmunity with the production of proinflammatory cytokines,  chemokines and proinflammatory lipoproteins.9,30\u201333 There is increasing recognition that mood disorders may be linked to persistent infections and autoimmune  illnesses.34 This pathophysiology is exemplified in patients with Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome  (PANS), in which antineuronal antibodies generated by microbial triggers cross the blood brain barrier resulting in  neuroinflammation; children suffering from PANS exhibit severe mood and behavioral symptoms.35 International Medical Case Reports Journal 2023:16 109\u2013115 109 \u00a9 2023 Kinderlehrer.

International Medical Case Reports Journal Dovepress open access to scientific and medical research Open Access Full Text Article Received: 29 October 2022 Accepted: 25 January 2023 Published: 3 March 2023 The treatment of Microbe-induced Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Syndromes (MANS) thus requires a trimodal  approach: psychopharmacologic agents, antimicrobials, and anti-inflammatory agents. In the latter category, several  interventions have exhibited some but limited success. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),  corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).36 There is compelling evidence that psilocybin has potential value in the treatment of some mental health conditions.  Multiple studies have documented its effectiveness in patients with depression, anxiety syndromes, end of life anxiety,  and suggested benefit in OCD and addiction disorders.37\u201343 Psilocybin is a serotonin agonist with an affinity for several  serotonin receptors.44 In addition, psilocybin extracts are capable of down-regulating pro-inflammatory mediators and  have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity.45\u201348 These actions suggest that psilocybin has potential benefit in  treating mental health issues associated with neuroinflammation. Methods A case is presented of an immunocompetent 70-year-old male diagnosed with polymicrobial tick-borne infections:  neuroborreliosis, babesiosis and bartonellosis. His predominant symptoms were neuropsychiatric. The patient was not  responding to antimicrobial or psychotropic pharmaceuticals, but symptoms remitted when treated with low intermittent  doses of psilocybin\u2014ie, microdosing. Informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this history. No institutional review was required. Case Presentation This patient was well until the age of 46 when he experienced the acute onset of fever, rigors, drenching sweats and  myalgias. These symptoms lasted three days then recurred weekly for the next two weeks. Physical examination was  significant for splenomegaly, and laboratory tests were positive for acute Lyme disease (see Table 1). He was not aware  of a tick attachment or a rash; he lived in eastern Massachusetts. Treatment was begun with oral doxycycline, and the recurrent febrile episodes remitted, but he subsequently  developed severe insomnia and anxiety. Over the next ten months he was on continuous antibiotics with oral doxycy\u0002cline, clarithromycin or cefuroxime, either alone or in combination. In addition to insomnia and anxiety he complained of  myalgias, neck pain and drenching night sweats. He stopped antibiotics because there was no apparent benefit in his  mood or physical symptoms. The subject did not have a family history of psychiatric illness, had no prior history of  mood disorder, and had not experienced a stressful event that might precipitate mood issues. Five years after the onset of his illness he was diagnosed with babesiosis with PCR positivity (see Table 1). He took  three weeks of azithromycin and atovaquone resulting in a Herxheimer reaction with panic attacks. At the end of three  weeks his symptoms had lessened. Over the next two decades the patient continued to have partial remissions and relapses. The relapses manifested in  anxiety, panic attacks, depression, cognitive dysfunction and insomnia, and were accompanied by fatigue, neck pain,  myalgias and night sweats. The relapses typically lasted about two years. Antidepressants including sertraline and  mirtazapine were somewhat helpful but over time were not tolerated. At some point the patient was clinically diagnosed  Table 1 Results of Testing for Tick-Borne Infections September, 1996 Lyme disease ELISA = 191 U/mL (RR >160 U/mL = Reactive) Western Blot IgM positive 39, 41 bands Western Blot IgG negative October, 2001 Babesia microti PCR positive August, 2019 Western Blot IgM positive 23, 39 bands Western Blot IgG positive 31, 58 bands Bartonella henselae IgM negative Bartonella henselae IgG positive Note: The Lyme Western Blot IgM positivity may represent persistent as well as acute infection.49,50 https://doi.org/10.2147/IMCRJ.S395342  DovePress  110 International Medical Case Reports Journal 2023:16  Kinderlehrer Dovepress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) with bartonellosis, and was maintained on sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) with some benefit. Laboratory  tests subsequently demonstrated positive serologies to both Borrelia burgdorferi and Bartonella henselae (see Table 1). At 70 years old, the patient suffered a relapse when his antimicrobial regimen was changed. He again experienced  severe depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties, as well as a return of his physical symptoms. He could no longer  tolerate any antimicrobials without making his symptoms worse. He was prescribed benzodiazepines for sleep and  anxiety but they made the depression worse. Sertraline afforded no benefit. After suffering for three months, he began  microdosing psilocybin (desiccated whole mushrooms) 100 mg orally three times a week, increasing the dose to 125 mg  after two weeks. Within two days there was a noticeable improvement in mood. Within two weeks he was feeling  consistently well again. He has continued this regimen and two years later his depression and anxiety continue to be in  remission. When the subject began this treatment regimen, he was led to expect that it would take two weeks to have any benefit,  if at all. He stated that he believed it had a 50% chance of helping him. He was genuinely surprised that he experienced  benefits so quickly after starting the regimen. Discussion Within three weeks of the acute onset of symptoms, this patient was diagnosed with Lyme disease, but despite antibiotics  he continued to be symptomatic. It was only after being diagnosed with babesiosis that it became clear that he did not  respond to the initial antimicrobials because of the presence of co-infections. In fact, the acute onset of high fevers, rigors  and diaphoresis with splenomegaly is consistent with babesiosis and not with Lyme borreliosis. But since he continued to  suffer from neuropsychiatric symptoms, he was subsequently also diagnosed with bartonellosis. This diagnosis was  supported by his response to SMZ-TMP as well as subsequent serologic testing. The presence of co-infections in patients  with persistent Lyme disease is more the rule than the exception.51\u201358 It is clear that the etiology of this subject\u2019s neuropsychiatric symptoms is the presence of tick-borne infections. The  neuropsychiatric symptoms began within a month of the acute infection; the subject had no prior history of mood  disorders; relapses in his mood issues were accompanied by physical symptoms consistent with the infections;  Herxheimer reactions caused an exacerbation in neuropsychiatric symptoms; there was no family history of psychiatric  disorders and no stressful event to account for a mood disorder. As noted previously, these tick-borne infections often result in significant neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients with  neuropsychiatric Lyme disease are often intolerant of psychotropic medication or resistant to their benefits.9,32 The underlying  pathophysiology of autoimmune neuroinflammation suggests the need for additional pharmaceutical approaches. After a 40-year prohibition in the US of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, there has been renewed  interest in their potential for therapeutic benefit. The preponderance of research in the past two decades has been in  controlled clinical settings in which subjects are administered a single high dose of a hallucinogen while under the  supervision of a therapist/guide. In 2018 the US Food and Drug Administration categorized psilocybin as \u201ca break\u0002through therapy\u201d in the treatment of depression, a designation the agency applies to drugs that in early trials demonstrate  substantial improvement over existing treatments.59 Microdosing is the practice of consuming very low, sub-hallucinogenic doses of a psychedelic substance on a regular  basis. The intention of microdosing is to offer similar benefits to full dose psychedelic therapy, but without perceptual  distortions, the need for clinical oversight, or the risk of a \u201cbad trip\u201d.60 Microdosing has become increasingly popular. In one online microdosing forum that was begun in 2013, the number  of subscribers rose to 40,000 in 2018 and 219,000 in October 2022.61 LSD and psilocybin continue to be listed as  schedule I controlled substances, meaning legally they have no accepted therapeutic value. Nevertheless, possession of  psilocybin has been decriminalized in many US cities and is on the ballot of many states to be legalized in clinical  therapeutic settings; Oregon and Colorado have already done so.62 Typical full dose psilocybin psychotherapy ranges from 3.0 to 5.0 gm of dried mushroom as a single dose. The doses of  psilocybin used in clinical studies refers to a synthetic version of the active purified derivative, O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,  N-dimethyltryptamine, a.k.a. psilocin, and averages 25 mg. for a single dose. Microdoses of psilocybin are commonly taken  two to three times a week at doses of 0.1 to 0.3 gm of dried mushroom. While the concentration of the active substance  International Medical Case Reports Journal 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/IMCRJ.S395342  DovePress  111 Dovepress Kinderlehrer Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) varies among mushrooms, 25 mg of psilocin is roughly equivalent to 5 gm of dried mushroom. Therefore, a macrodose is  anywhere from ten to fifty times more potent than a microdose. There are numerous reports in the medical literature regarding the therapeutic benefits of microdosed psilocybin in  which recipients report reductions in stress, anxiety and depression as well as improvements in cognition and  creativity.61,63\u201367 The majority of these reports have significant shortcomings: most are anecdotal or open-label research  utilizing self-reported surveys; investigators generally included users of both microdosed LSD and psilocybin; and the  positive outcomes could not consistently be distinguished from preexisting expectations or placebo effect.68\u201371 Clearly it  would be preferable to perform prospective, controlled and blinded studies, and to do so on psilocybin and LSD separately. Cavanna et al performed a double-blind placebo-controlled study of psilocybin with 0.5 gm of ground dried mushroom  administered two separate days for one week and a placebo of the same weight administered two separate days on a different  week.72 There were 34 participants, and the sequence was randomized by a third party. The investigators documented  subjective changes in the participants while on the active leg of the study, characterized only by the participants\u2019 capacity to  distinguish the active vs placebo intervention. There were EEG changes (reduced activity in the theta band) in the active leg  but the only other difference between the active and placebo arms was a slight impairment in cognition when taking the  psilocybin. The authors concluded that alleged benefits of microdosing psilocybin are a placebo effect. The Cavanna study suffers from obvious shortcomings: the dose of 0.5 gm is over twice the average microdose; one  week with two doses was an exceedingly short trial; there were only 34 participants; and the study design excluded  subjects with a history of anxiety or depression. It is clear that studies based on self-reporting of subjective symptoms suffer from validation issues. In none of the  studies described above are populations matched in the active vs placebo arms of the trials in terms of mental health  issues. Indeed, it is difficult to quantify these subjective symptoms; outcomes are assessed by self-reporting that could  suffer from expectations or inaccurate memories. The benefit of macrodosed psilocybin for some mental health disorders is well documented. However, thus far the  evidence for similar benefits of microdosed psilocybin remains anecdotal. Clearly more research on the effectiveness of  microdosing is warranted. The subject of this report maintains that he was not expecting any response to the microdose intervention, if any, for  at least two weeks. Unexpectedly, he experienced a significant decrease in anxiety and depression within two days. In his  case, this would appear to exclude a placebo effect. Most reports on psilocybin attribute its mental health benefits to its role as a serotonin agonist. Psilocybin has a high  affinity for the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A, and milder affinity for serotonin receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C, as well as other  serotonin and non-serotonin receptors.44,73,74 While pretreatment with ketanserin, a 5-HT2A antagonist, can block the  psychomimetic effects of psilocybin,75 one animal study found that ketanserin did not appear to block its antidepressant  action.74 In addition, stimulation of both the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors could be linked to striatal dopamine release,  suggesting that psilocybin-induced psychotropic effects could be both dopaminergic and serotonergic.73,76 Less attention has been paid to the anti-inflammatory action of psilocybin, which could yield significant therapeutic  benefit when mental health issues are associated with neuroinflammation. Serotonin is a known immune modulator as  well as a neurotransmitter, suppressing the production of cytokines by human macrophages.47 Extracts of psilocybin  containing mushrooms significantly inhibit the lipopolysaccharide production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and  interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and lowered IL-6 and cyclooxygenase-2 concentrations in human macrophage cells.46\u201348 In a review  of the immunomodulatory effects of psychedelics, Thompson and Szabo have proposed that these agents hold the  potential to \u201cattenuate or even resolve autoimmunity\u201d.77 In the case presentation under discussion, the rapidity of the  clinical response to microdosed psilocybin is consistent with the anti-inflammatory actions of this agent. Concerning safety issues, Studerus et al reviewed eight studies consisting of 110 human subjects, each of whom  received one to four macrodoses of psilocybin.78 The only adverse reactions were short-term dysphoria and/or anxiety;  these reactions were associated with the highest doses of psilocybin. The subjects were followed for eight to 16 months  post psilocybin administration, and did not report any long-term side effects. The participants in those studies received  ten to fifty times the amount of an average microdose. In studies of individuals who microdose, the only adverse  reactions reported have been short-term physical discomfort, impaired cognition and anxiety.79 https://doi.org/10.2147/IMCRJ.S395342  DovePress  112 International Medical Case Reports Journal 2023:16  Kinderlehrer Dovepress Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Conclusion Neuropsychiatric Lyme disease is associated with autoimmune neuroinflammation triggered by microbial infection.  While antibiotics and psychopharmacologic agents are important arms of treatment, agents that can modulate the  inflammatory response without immune suppression have therapeutic potential. In the present case presentation, an  immunocompetent male with well documented neuropsychiatric Lyme disease experienced significant improvement soon  after taking microdoses of psilocybin three times weekly. The therapeutic benefit of a single high dose of psilocybin in some mental health disorders administered while under the  supervision of a therapist/guide has been well documented. While the evidence for therapeutic benefit in those who microdose  has not been well authenticated, the anti-inflammatory action of psilocybin may be valuable in the treatment of autoimmune  conditions in general and autoimmune neuroinflammation in particular. The present case history is the first to document the  successful application of microdosed psilocybin in the treatment of mental health issues secondary to microbe induced  autoimmune neuroinflammation. Clearly more research is warranted into the therapeutic potential of microdosing psilocybin in patients with mental  health issues and autoimmunity. Ideally, studies will employ double blinded placebo-controlled investigations in which  matched subjects include those with anxiety and depression. Similar research in patients suffering from neuropsychiatric  Lyme and other autoimmune encephalopathies could yield effective therapeutic options in this difficult to treat population.

Apolipoprotein-A-I for severe COVID-19-induced hyperinflammatory states: A prospective case study. Frontiers in Pharmacology. 2022;13:936659 on 27 Oct 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a Physician from France and concerns a 52-year-old male patient (patient 1) who experienced serious adverse reactions of a virus-induced cytokin storm and hemophagocytosis associated with mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus. The patient was with a history of IgA vasculitis, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease and had received a kidney transplant in 2018. He had been given three doses of mRNA vaccine but developed only weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity (anti-spike antibodies 15.5 BAU/mL). He developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 17 December 2021 (fever, diarrhea, and dyspnea) and was admitted to the hospital on December 25. Oxygen saturation was 92% in room air, and oxygen supplementation was started (1 L/min). The chest CT scan showed a bilateral interstitial lung disease compatible with COVID-19 (parenchyma extension 25%). Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (variant-of concern (VOC) Delta). Blood tests showed a hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 5,037 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 34 mg/L), liver test abnormalities (AST and ALT 2.5 and 3.5 times the upper limit normal (ULN) values, respectively), and thrombocytopenia. Tacrolimus was pursued, mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn, and dexamethasone was introduced (6 mg/day) with antibiotics. On day 2, the blood tests showed pancytopenia and progression of the hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 6,870 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 55 mg/L). He received one infusion of the monoclonal anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab (8 mg/kg i.v.) and one infusion of neutralizing monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (casirimivab/ imdevimab). On day 4, ferritin increased to 19,219 \u03bcg/L, AST and ALT increased to 17 and 14 times the ULN values, respectively, and arterial lactates were at 2.7 mmol/L. Bone marrow aspirate showed features of hemophagocytosis. Blood PCR of SARS-CoV-2 was weakly positive. Worsening hypoxia required increased oxygenation (4 L/min; PaO2 62 mmHg), and the CT scan showed progressive lung lesions typical of COVID-19 (50% of the parenchyma). Despite increasing dexamethasone to 10 mg/day, serum triglycerides and ferritin increased to 3.2 mmol/L and 27,394 \u03bcg/L, respectively, on day 6. Dosing: According to the available information regarding its safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (Keyserling et al., 2017), CER-001 was given intravenously over 0.5\u20131 h at a dose of 10 mg/kg at hours 0 and 12 (patient 1). In order to address the safety of the procedure, patient 1 received only two infusions of CER-001. Administration was preceded by anti-histaminic prophylaxis with hydroxyzine (50 mg i.v.). In the patient, dexamethasone was pursued. This patient did not develop any serious adverse events. Bioefficacy: lipid profiles as shown, the patient had very low serum levels of ApoA-I (normal value > 1.1 g/ L) and HDL (normal value > 0.45 g/L) and high serum levels of triglycerides (normal value < 1.5 g/L) when CER-001 was started. Lipid tests were not available at the time of admission to the hospital. Following infusion of CER-001, ApoA-I and HDL levels normalized at day 2 but remained in the lower range of the normal values in most inflammatory patients. Inflammation kinetic: At baseline, IL-1\u03b2 was normal in all individuals, IL-6 was increased in the three patients who previously received tocilizumab and was normal in the latter (3.3\u20131,295 pg/ml), and TNF-\u03b1 was moderately increased (9.7\u201342.1 pg/ml). IL-8 was the only inflammatory cytokine universally increased (>10 pg/ml; 14.8\u201364.5 pg/ml). Following CER-001, IL-8 normalized in this patient. Body temperature remained below 37.5\u00b0. Clinical outcomes: CER-001 administration was followed by a rapid improvement of the clinical condition, allowing them to be discharged from the hospital 3\u20134 days after the CER-001 infusions. In this patient oxygen supplementation was withdrawn 2 days after the administration. In these three patients, inflammatory parameters, liver tests, and blood cell count improved until discharge. Case was created post author follow up received on 27 Oct 2022 Symptoms including pancytopenia progression of the hyperinflammatory were linked to COVID19, but immunosuppression favored the development of a virus-induced cytokin storm. Follow-up information has been requested. 18-Jul-2023: The case was corrected and resubmitted on 18-Jul-2023. Linked report numbers \u201cFR-MLMSERVICE-20230711-4408733-1 and FR-STADA-280412 (FR-MLMSERVICE-20230711-4408630-1) were added.

Hyperinflammatory states, including critical forms of COVID-19, are characterized by a remodeling of the lipid profile including a dramatic decrease of the serum levels of apolipoprotein-A-I (ApoA-I), a protein known for its capacity to reduce systemic and lung inflammation, modulate innate and adaptive immunity, and prevent endothelial dysfunction and blood coagulation. In this study, four immunocompromised patients with severe COVID-19 cytokine storm that progressed despite standard-of-care therapy [Omicron (n = 3) and Delta (n = 1) variants] received 2\u2013 4 infusions (10 mg/kg) of CER-001, an ApoA-I-containing HDL mimetic. Injections were well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. Three patients treated while not on mechanical ventilation had early clinical and biological improvement (oxygen withdrawal and correction of hematological and inflammatory parameters, including serum levels of interleukin-8) and were discharged from the hospital 3\u20134 days after CER-001 infusions. In the fourth patient who received CER-001 after orotracheal intubation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, infusions were followed by transient respiratory improvement before secondary worsening related to ventilation-associated pneumonia. This pilot uncontrolled exploratory compassionate study provides initial safety and proof-of\u0002concept data from patients with a COVID-19 cytokine storm receiving ApoA-I. Further randomized controlled trial evaluation is now required to ascertain whether ApoA-I has any beneficial effects on patients with a COVID-19 cytokine storm.

In fatal cases, autopsies demonstrated the development of significant vasculopathy and increased vascular congestion in the lungs (Villalba et al., 2022). In addition, extensive analyses of COVID-19 ARDS identified phenotypes and molecular changes that distinguish it from other causes of ARDS (Empson et al., 2022). In rare cases, a COVID\u000219-associated cytokine storm may culminate in a hyperinflammatory state similar to, but still distinct from, autoinflammatory macrophage activation syndrome (Kessel et al., 2021). COVID-19 evolved as a biphasic disorder including first underlying inborn or acquired immunodeficiency (type I/III\u0002interferon response deficiency) leading to viral escape to immune defenses, and then a hyperinflammatory response promoting lung injury, endotheliopathy, and coagulopathy (Asano et al., 2021; Carapito et al., 2021; Paludan and Mogensen, 2022). Among other features, critical COVID-19 is characterized by high circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and ICAM-1 and low levels of FasL (Kessel et al., 2021; del Valle et al., 2020). This finding prompted the use of immunomodulatory approaches (e.g., corticosteroids or IL-1, IL-6, or JAK inhibitors) to prevent or treat COVID-19 ARDS and secondary lung fibrosis and ultimately to prevent refractory respiratory failure (van de Veerdonk et al., 2022). These treatments, used alone or in combination, are associated with some degree of improvements but have unpredictable effects. In addition, they may be associated with an increased risk of secondary infection, including life-threatening opportunistic infections mitigating their positive effects (Gangneux et al., 2022). This is particularly true in individuals with underlying immunosuppression, like those who received solid organ transplantation. Targeted and unbiased metabolomic approaches have identified low serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) and apolipoprotein-A-I (ApoA-I) as strong predictive factors of severe forms of COVID-19 (Sun et al., 2020; Begue et al., 2021; Hilser et al., 2021). Alterations of the lipoprotein plasma composition were demonstrated (for instance, downregulation of apolipoproteins, clusterin, and paraoxonase) (Begue et al., 2021). In addition, SARS-CoV\u00022 infection also triggers a humoral response against ApoA-I that may modulate the outcome of COVID-19 (Pagano et al., 2021). Interestingly, several lines of evidence point to the role of ApoA-I in modulating inflammation and innate and adaptive immunity in various settings, suggesting a potential therapeutic use in COVID-19 (Sorokin et al., 2020). Therefore, ApoA-I can inhibit the activity of monocytes (Hyka et al., 2001; Smythies et al., 2010), inhibit the cross talk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells in terms of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 (Kim et al., 2005), decrease T-lymphocyte activation by activated macrophages (Hyka et al., 2001), and reduce the inflammatory response of type II pneumocytes to a viral challenge (van Lenten et al., 2004). In mice, an ApoA-I mimetic reduced the severity of influenza\u0002related pneumonia (van Lenten et al., 2002). Very recently, Kelesidis et al. (2021) reported that the ApoA-I mimetic peptide 4F attenuates in vitro the replication of SARS-CoV\u00022 and associated apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation (IL-6 production) in epithelial cells. CER-001 is an engineered, pre-\u03b2 HDL particle that contains human recombinant ApoA-1 together with natural phospholipids, combined into a single small discoidal particle (Keyserling et al., 2017). CER-001 was formerly developed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, but we recently reported that it can be proposed in patients with inherited lecithin-cholesterol-acyl-transferase deficiency to prevent kidney disease progression (Faguer et al., 2021). A preliminary study by Tanaka et al. (2022) reported a good tolerance of CER\u0002001 in a critically ill patient with severe COVID-19 and secondary infection and a reduction in inflammatory markers. In addition, native HDL may exert a potent antiviral effect against SARS-Cov-2 (Cho et al., 2021). Altogether, these findings put forward the hypothesis that ApoA-I supplementation may prevent the progression of COVID-19 toward critical forms and/or reverse the cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we aimed to assess the tolerance of ApoA-I supplementation in four critically ill individuals who developed a COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory state and were included in an ApoA-I compassionate-access program. As a secondary objective, their outcomes were reported. Patients and methods Approval and patients\u2019 inclusion The four patients included in this study were treated at the University Hospital of Toulouse (France) under a compassionate use program that was approved by the French Agency for the Safety of Drugs and Health Products (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des Produits de Sant\u00e9 [ANSM]; Frontiers in Pharmacology 02 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 authorization #2021-104249; #2022-107250; #2022-108293; #2022-108518). All patients provided informed consent to receive CER-001 and to be included in the Nephrogene Biobank which was approved by the French National Ethical Review Board (DC-2011-1388). The study was conducted from 15 December 2021 to 31 January 2022. Patients had documented COVID-19 (nasopharyngeal PCR) and hyperinflammatory state characterized by a serum level of ferritin higher than 1000 \u03bcg/L and inflammation-related organ injury (respiratory failure, coma, cytopenia, and hepatitis). They were also characterized by an ApoA-I serum level below 0.9 g/L (normal value > 1.1 g/L). Drugs delivery CER-001 was generously offered by Abionyx Pharma. Abionyx Pharma had no access to the data during the treatment period and did not participate in the article writing. Standard-of-care treatment was pursued, as appropriate. Clinical follow-up Patients were followed up throughout their hospitalization stay and underwent physical examinations and routine blood sampling (complete blood count, arterial blood gases, inflammatory markers, kidney and liver functions, and lipid tests). Cytokine measurements (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) were performed immediately before and at several time points after the first administration of CER-001, using the ELLA nanofluidic system (Bio-Techne, France). Clinical and biological characteristics prior to and following CER-001 administration were compared descriptively. The major endpoints were survival and adverse events (safety part of the study). The secondary endpoints were the length of hospitalization, the evolution of inflammatory parameters (ferritin and cytokines), and the oxygen supports in patients with ARDS. Results Cases histories Patient 1 was a 52-year-old male patient with a history of IgA vasculitis, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease and had received a kidney transplant in 2018. He had been given three doses of mRNA vaccine but developed only weak anti-SARS\u0002CoV-2 immunity (anti-spike antibodies 15.5 BAU/mL). He developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 17 December 2021 (fever, diarrhea, and dyspnea) and was admitted to the hospital on December 25. Oxygen saturation was 92% in room air, and oxygen supplementation was started (1 L/min). The chest CT scan showed a bilateral interstitial lung disease compatible with COVID-19 (parenchyma extension 25%). Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (variant-of\u0002concern (VOC) Delta). Blood tests showed a hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 5,037 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 34 mg/L), liver test abnormalities (AST and ALT 2.5 and 3.5 times the upper limit normal (ULN) values, respectively), and thrombocytopenia. Tacrolimus was pursued, mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn, and dexamethasone was introduced (6 mg/day) with antibiotics. On day 2, the blood tests showed pancytopenia and progression of the hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 6,870 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 55 mg/L). He received one infusion of the monoclonal anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab (8 mg/kg i.v.) and one infusion of neutralizing monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (casirimivab/ imdevimab). On day 4, ferritin increased to 19,219 \u03bcg/L, AST and ALT increased to 17 and 14 times the ULN values, respectively, and arterial lactates were at 2.7 mmol/L. Bone marrow aspirate showed features of hemophagocytosis. Blood PCR of SARS-CoV-2 was weakly positive. Worsening hypoxia required increased oxygenation (4 L/min; PaO2 62 mmHg), and the CT scan showed progressive lung lesions typical of COVID\u000219 (50% of the parenchyma). Despite increasing dexamethasone to 10 mg/day, serum triglycerides and ferritin increased to 3.2 mmol/L and 27,394 \u03bcg/L, respectively, on day 6. Patient 2 was a 38-year-old female patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and being overweight and had received a kidney transplant in 2011. She had been given three doses of mRNA vaccine but developed no anti-SARS-CoV\u00022 immunity. She developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 4 January 2022 (cough, chills, diarrhea, and fever) and was admitted to the transplantation ward on January 14. Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (VOC Omicron). Upon admission, SaO2 was 94% while receiving 9 L/min of oxygen with a facial mask. The chest CT scan showed typical lesions of COVID-19 (extension 50%). Blood tests showed hepatitis with cytolysis and cholestasis (7\u201310 times the ULN values, respectively), acute kidney injury (KDIGO stage 1), and hyperinflammation (ferritin 2,000 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 107 mg/L). High-flow oxygen supplementation, awake prone position, dexamethasone (10 mg/day), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg once), and antibiotics were started. Everolimus was withdrawn, and tacrolimus was pursued. On day 4, despite full\u0002code therapy, high-flow oxygen supplementation was still required, and the hyperinflammatory state worsened (ferritin 2,800 \u03bcg/L). Patient 3 was a 47-year-old female patient with a history of diabetes mellitus, adrenal Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypertension, and end-stage kidney disease requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy since 2020. She did not receive anti\u0002SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and had no anti-SARS-CoV\u00022 immunity at the time of admission to the hospital. She developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 15 January 2022 Frontiers in Pharmacology 03 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 (cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and fever) and was admitted to the hospital on January 19. Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (VOC Omicron). The chest CT scan showed mild to moderate lung lesions typical of COVID-19 (10%\u2013 25%). She did not require oxygen supplementation. Blood tests showed hyperinflammatory syndrome (ferritin 4,350 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 55 mg/L) with a moderate increase in AST and ALT (2 and 1.5 times the ULN values, respectively) and mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. Dexamethasone (6 mg/day) was introduced. On day 3, hyperferritinemia (4,142 \u03bcg/L) and liver test abnormalities persisted, and she developed encephalopathy leading to admission to the intensive care unit. Patient 4 was a 59-year-old male patient with a history of hepatitis B, liver transplantation in 2006, HHV8-negative Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (complete remission), and end-stage kidney disease requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy since 2020. He had received three doses of mRNA vaccines but developed no anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Owing to familial exposure to SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal PCR was performed on 6 January 2022, identifying the VOC Omicron variant. He developed symptoms of COVID-19 on January 15 (asthenia) but had no respiratory symptoms. The chest CT scan showed mild to moderate lung lesions typical of COVID-19 (10%\u2013 25%). On January 17, dyspnea, cough, and fever developed. Upon admission, PaO2 was 54 mmHg in room air, his respiratory rate was 30 cycles/min, and body temperature was 38.5\u00b0 C. Blood tests showed hyperferritinemia (1,223 \u03bcg/ L) and leukopenia (1,080 cells/mm3 ). A CT scan showed progression of lung lesions (25%\u201350%). Oxygen supplementation, dexamethasone (10 mg/day), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, once), antibiotics, and fresh frozen plasma from convalescent patients were given. Mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn, and tacrolimus was pursued. On day 5, acute respiratory failure developed requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with neuromuscular blocking. Blood tests showed a hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 4,535 \u03bcg/L) with increased AST and ALT (three times the ULN values). At that time, the bronchoalveolar fluid culture was negative, suggestive of critical COVID-19 only. The PaO2 to FiO2 ratio was in the range of 150\u2013180. Antibiotics were pursued. Dosing According to the available information regarding its safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (Keyserling et al., 2017), CER-001 was given intravenously over 0.5\u20131 h at a dose of 10 mg/kg at hours 0 and 12 (patient 1) and hours 0, 12, 24, and 48 (patients 2, 3, and 4). In order to address the safety of the procedure, patient 1 received only two infusions of CER\u0002001, whereas patients 2\u20134 received four infusions. Administration was preceded by anti-histaminic prophylaxis with hydroxyzine (50 mg i.v.). In all patients, dexamethasone was pursued. General safety Patients 1, 2, and 3 did not develop any serious adverse events. Patient 4 developed two episodes of ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus plus mucormycosis) and one bacteremia (Staphylococcus haemolyticus). Bioefficacy: lipid profiles As shown in Figure 1, all four patients had very low serum levels of ApoA-I (range 0.74\u20130.79 mg/L, normal value > 1.1 g/ L) and HDL (range 0.26\u20130.35, normal value > 0.45 g/L) and high serum levels of triglycerides (range 2.16\u20133.4 g/L, normal value < 1.5 g/L) when CER-001 was started. Lipid tests were not available at the time of admission to the hospital. Following infusion of CER-001, ApoA-I and HDL levels normalized in all patients at day 2 but remained in the lower range of the normal values in most inflammatory patients. In patient 4, who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia 3 days after the start of CER-001, ApoA-I subsequently decreased below the normal values. Inflammation kinetic At baseline, IL-1\u03b2 was normal in all individuals, IL-6 was increased in the three patients who previously received tocilizumab and was normal in the latter (3.3\u20131,295 pg/ml), and TNF-\u03b1 was moderately increased (9.7\u201342.1 pg/ml). IL-8 was the only inflammatory cytokine universally increased (>10 pg/ml; 14.8\u201364.5 pg/ml) (Figure 1). Following CER-001, IL-8 normalized in patients 1, 2, and 3. In patient 4, IL-8 decreased immediately after the injections and re-increased at the time of a ventilator-associated pneumonia. Serum levels of ferritin decreased from 6,616 \u00b1 8,696 to 1,712 \u00b1 815 \u03bcg/L, 6 days after the start of CER-001. The administration of anti-IL6R antibodies before CER-001 in 3 out of 4 patients precluded the analysis of C-reactive protein. Body temperature remained below 37.5\u00b0 in all patients. Clinical outcomes CER-001 administration was followed by a rapid improvement of the clinical condition of patients 1, 2, and 3, allowing them to be discharged from the hospital 3\u20134 days after the CER-001 infusions (Figure 1). In patients 1 and 2, oxygen Frontiers in Pharmacology 04 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 supplementation was withdrawn 2 and 3 days after the administration, respectively. In patient 3, confusion resolved within 2 days. In these three patients, inflammatory parameters, liver tests, and blood cell count improved until discharge. Patient 4 received mechanical ventilation for 3 days when CER-001 was introduced. After a first phase of improvement (neuromuscular blocker withdrawal and sedation lightening) for 3 days, he secondarily developed several ventilator-associated pneumonia infections and ultimately died 1 month later. These infections were considered unrelated to the CER-001 treatment. Discussion In this study, we reported the outcomes of four individuals with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who received ApoA-I supplementation as salvage therapy. In addition to a very good FIGURE 1 Outcomes of four individuals with the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm who received CER-001 as salvage therapy. DXM, dexamethasone; TCZ, tocilizumab; ApoA-I, apolipoprotein-A-I; IL-8, interleukin-8; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1; IL-6, inteleukin-6. Frontiers in Pharmacology 05 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 acute tolerance of CER-001, as already observed in other settings outside critical care units (Nicholls et al., 2018; Faguer et al., 2021), we observed a rapid improvement in respiratory status, a decrease in inflammatory parameters, and the normalization of blood cell counts, paralleling the normalization of ApoA-I levels after CER-001 in 3 out of 4 patients. On the contrary, they developed critical COVID-19-related cytokine storm, and they could be discharged home, without oxygen support, as soon as 3\u20134 days after CER-001 infusions. After the completion of this compassionate-use access, Tanaka et al. (2022) also reported a case of severe COVID-19 in which CER-001 administration was followed by a dramatic decrease of inflammatory parameters during infusion. These preliminary clinical results and data obtained in vitro (Kelesidis et al., 2021) strongly support the development of a randomized double\u0002blind clinical trial testing CER-001 in patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19, especially in those more at risk of developing a critical disease. Several studies have reported that ApoA-I and HDL-C are less abundant in COVID-19 patients (Poynard et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Begue et al., 2021; Hilser et al., 2021), especially in the most severe forms, and that HDL-C from COVID-19 patients is less protective in endothelial cells submitted to inflammatory triggers and does not protect them from apoptosis (Begue et al., 2021). Low serum levels of ApoA-I may increase both the risk of developing COVID-19 (Poynard et al., 2020) and the risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 (Begue et al., 2021). Such a decrease in ApoA-I or HDL-C is a common finding in cytokine storms and was observed in virus-induced and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (Henter et al., 1991; Kraskovsky et al., 2021) and in dengue shock syndrome (Marin-Palma et al., 2019). Thus, the results derived from this study may potentially be valid in other settings of hyperinflammatory states. Beyond its potential ability to prevent severe forms of COVID-19, ApoA-I also modulates virologic control by hosts and their immune responses against various viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus and dengue virus) (Srinivas et al., 1990; Coelho et al., 2021). Our data thus support future trials in other forms of virus-induced hyperinflammatory states, like viral HLHs or dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome. Among the various inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 was the only cytokine that was universally increased (>10 pg/ml), confirming its ability to identify patients developing critical COVID-19 (Kessel et al., 2021). IL-6 was also increased though the previous use of tocilizumab which precluded firm conclusions (Nishimoto et al., 2008). Our proof-of-concept study was not designed to distinguish whether hyperinflammation and COVID-19 were indeed reversed by the ApoA-I supplementation itself or whether it was only a fortuitous association, but, following CER-001, we observed a rapid decrease in IL-8 in the three patients with a favorable outcome, paralleling the clinical and biological improvement. In patient 4, after a first phase of clinical improvement accompanied by ApoA-I normalization and IL-8 decrease, ventilation-associated pneumonia and clinical deterioration were accompanied by C-reactive protein and IL-8 increase and ApoA-I decrease. In this study, patients received four infusions of CER-001 (10 mg/kg), but the use of a higher dose for the first injection (e.g., 15 mg/kg) may help reach the optimal concentrations of ApoA-I and non-oxidized HDL more rapidly to achieve maximal therapeutic effects. Also, the pharmacokinetic of CER-001 has only been described in healthy individuals (Keyserling et al., 2017). In a phase 1 clinical study, a 10 mg/kg dose led to an increase of ApoA-I in the range of 0.1\u20130.2 g/L in the first 12 h followed by rapid normalization (Keyserling et al., 2017) that prompted us to inject CER-001 at hours 0, 12, 24, and 48 to reach optimal values of blood ApoA\u0002I in a setting of low baseline values. Whether its half-life is extended in critically ill patients with liver failure is currently unknown. This study has several limitations including its uncontrolled design and the small size of the cohort which could be included in the compassionate access program. This did not allow us to identify COVID-19 patients with the highest probability to benefit from CER-001 and whether specific sub-phenotypes (according to the degree of inflammation, vasculopathy, or other parameters to be determined) may better respond to ApoA-1 supplementation. This will require additional analyses on larger cohorts. Second, one patient had a COVID-19 hyperinflammatory state but not respiratory failure. Our purpose was first to confirm the feasibility and tolerance of ApoA-I supplementation in the setting of critically ill COVID\u000219 patients. Here, we report the rapid improvement of some patients with COVID-19 ARDS or a hyperinflammatory state. Conclusion In summary, this pilot uncontrolled exploratory compassionate study provides initial safety and proof-of\u0002concept data from patients with a COVID-19 cytokine storm receiving ApoA-I. Further randomized controlled trial evaluation is now required to ascertain whether ApoA-I has any beneficial effects on patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm.

Danet C, Renaudineau Y, Izopet J, Kamar N. Apolipoprotein-A-I for severe COVID-19-induced hyperinflammatory states: A prospective case study. Frontiers in Pharmacology. 2022;13:936659 on 27 Oct 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a Physician from France and concerns a 59-year-old male patient (patient 4) who experienced serious adverse reactions of COVID-19/virus-induced cytokin storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, increased AST and ALT (three times the ULN values) associated with mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. This patient received CER-001 after orotracheal intubation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, infusions were followed by transient respiratory improvement before secondary worsening related to ventilation-associated pneumonia. The patient\u2019s medical history included hepatitis B, liver transplantation in 2006, HHV8-negative Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (complete remission), and end-stage kidney disease requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy since 2020. He had received three doses of mRNA vaccines but developed no anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Owing to familial exposure to SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal PCR was performed on 6 January 2022, identifying the VOC Omicron variant. He developed symptoms of COVID-19 on January 15 (asthenia) but had no respiratory symptoms. The chest CT scan showed mild to moderate lung lesions typical of COVID-19 (10%\u2013 25%). On January 17, dyspnea, cough, and fever developed. Upon admission, PaO2 was 54 mmHg in room air, his respiratory rate was 30 cycles/min, and body temperature was 38.5 C. Blood tests showed hyperferritinemia (1223 \u03bcg/L) and leukopenia (1080 cells/mm^3). A CT scan showed progression of lung lesions (25%\u201350%). Oxygen supplementation, dexamethasone (10 mg/day), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, once), antibiotics, and fresh frozen plasma from convalescent patients were given. Mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn, and tacrolimus was pursued. On day 5, acute respiratory failure developed requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with neuromuscular blocking. Blood tests showed a hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 4535 \u03bcg/L) with increased AST and ALT (three times the ULN values). At that time, the bronchoalveolar fluid culture was negative, suggestive of critical COVID-19 only. The PaO2 to FiO2 ratio was in the range of 150\u2013180. Antibiotics were pursued. Dosing: According to the available information regarding its safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, CER-001 was given intravenously over 0.5\u20131 h at a dose of 10 mg/kg at hours 0, 12, 24, and 48. In order to address the safety of the procedure, patient received four infusions of CER-001. Administration was preceded by anti-histaminic prophylaxis with hydroxyzine (50 mg i.v.). In the patient, dexamethasone was pursued. The patient developed two episodes of ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus plus mucormycosis) and one bacteremia (Staphylococcus haemolyticus). Bioefficacy: The patient had very low serum levels of ApoA-I (normal value > 1.1 g/ L) and HDL (normal value > 0.45 g/L) and high serum levels of triglycerides (normal value < 1.5 g/L) when CER-001 was started. Lipid tests were not available at the time of admission to the hospital. Following infusion of CER-001, ApoA-I and HDL levels normalized at day 2 but remained in the lower range of the normal values in most inflammatory patients. The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia 3 days after the start of CER-001, ApoA-I subsequently decreased below the normal values. Inflammation kinetic: At baseline, IL-1\u03b2 was normal, IL-6 was increased, TNF-\u03b1 was moderately increased and IL-8 was increased. Following CER-001, IL-8 decreased immediately after the injections and re-increased at the time of a ventilator-associated pneumonia. Serum levels of ferritin decreased 6 days after the start of CER-001. Body temperature remained below 37.5 degree celsius. Clinical outcomes: This patient received mechanical ventilation for 3 days when CER-001 was introduced. After a first phase of improvement (neuromuscular blocker withdrawal and sedation lightening) for 3 days, he secondarily developed several ventilator-associated pneumonia infections and ultimately died 1 month later. These infections were considered unrelated to the CER-001 treatment. This case was considered valid post receipt of author response on 27 Oct 2022. The author stated \u201cSymptoms were linked to COVID19, but immunosuppression favored the development of a virus-induced cytokin storm\u201d Follow-up information has been requested.Apolipoprotein-A-I for severe COVID-19-induced hyperinflammatory states: A prospective case study Stanislas Faguer 1,2,3 *, Arnaud Del Bello1 , Chlo\u00e9 Danet4 , Yves Renaudineau2,5,6 , Jacques Izopet 2,5,7 and Nassim Kamar 1,2,5 1 Referral Center for Rare Kidney Diseases, Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France, 2 Faculty of Medicine, University Paul Sabatier\u2014Toulouse 3, Toulouse, France, 3 French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, U1297 (Institute of Metabolic and Cardiovascular Diseases), Toulouse, France, 4 Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France, 5 French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, U1291 (INFINITY), Toulouse, France, 6 Laboratory of Immunology, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France, 7 Laboratory of Virology, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France Viral infections can promote cytokine storm and multiorgan failure in individuals with an underlying immunosuppression or specific genetic background. Hyperinflammatory states, including critical forms of COVID-19, are characterized by a remodeling of the lipid profile including a dramatic decrease of the serum levels of apolipoprotein-A-I (ApoA-I), a protein known for its capacity to reduce systemic and lung inflammation, modulate innate and adaptive immunity, and prevent endothelial dysfunction and blood coagulation. In this study, four immunocompromised patients with severe COVID-19 cytokine storm that progressed despite standard-of-care therapy [Omicron (n = 3) and Delta (n = 1) variants] received 2\u2013 4 infusions (10 mg/kg) of CER-001, an ApoA-I-containing HDL mimetic. Injections were well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. Three patients treated while not on mechanical ventilation had early clinical and biological improvement (oxygen withdrawal and correction of hematological and inflammatory parameters, including serum levels of interleukin-8) and were discharged from the hospital 3\u20134 days after CER-001 infusions. In the fourth patient who received CER-001 after orotracheal intubation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, infusions were followed by transient respiratory improvement before secondary worsening related to ventilation-associated pneumonia. This pilot uncontrolled exploratory compassionate study provides initial safety and proof-of\u0002concept data from patients with a COVID-19 cytokine storm receiving ApoA-I. Further randomized controlled trial evaluation is now required to ascertain whether ApoA-I has any beneficial effects on patients with a COVID-19 cytokine storm.

In fatal cases, autopsies demonstrated the development of significant vasculopathy and increased vascular congestion in the lungs (Villalba et al., 2022). In addition, extensive analyses of COVID-19 ARDS identified phenotypes and molecular changes that distinguish it from other causes of ARDS (Empson et al., 2022). In rare cases, a COVID\u000219-associated cytokine storm may culminate in a hyperinflammatory state similar to, but still distinct from, autoinflammatory macrophage activation syndrome (Kessel et al., 2021). COVID-19 evolved as a biphasic disorder including first underlying inborn or acquired immunodeficiency (type I/III\u0002interferon response deficiency) leading to viral escape to immune defenses, and then a hyperinflammatory response promoting lung injury, endotheliopathy, and coagulopathy (Asano et al., 2021; Carapito et al., 2021; Paludan and Mogensen, 2022). Among other features, critical COVID-19 is characterized by high circulating levels of interleukin (IL)-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and ICAM-1 and low levels of FasL (Kessel et al., 2021; del Valle et al., 2020). This finding prompted the use of immunomodulatory approaches (e.g., corticosteroids or IL-1, IL-6, or JAK inhibitors) to prevent or treat COVID-19 ARDS and secondary lung fibrosis and ultimately to prevent refractory respiratory failure (van de Veerdonk et al., 2022). These treatments, used alone or in combination, are associated with some degree of improvements but have unpredictable effects. In addition, they may be associated with an increased risk of secondary infection, including life-threatening opportunistic infections mitigating their positive effects (Gangneux et al., 2022). This is particularly true in individuals with underlying immunosuppression, like those who received solid organ transplantation. Targeted and unbiased metabolomic approaches have identified low serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) and apolipoprotein-A-I (ApoA-I) as strong predictive factors of severe forms of COVID-19 (Sun et al., 2020; Begue et al., 2021; Hilser et al., 2021). Alterations of the lipoprotein plasma composition were demonstrated (for instance, downregulation of apolipoproteins, clusterin, and paraoxonase) (Begue et al., 2021). In addition, SARS-CoV\u00022 infection also triggers a humoral response against ApoA-I that may modulate the outcome of COVID-19 (Pagano et al., 2021). Interestingly, several lines of evidence point to the role of ApoA-I in modulating inflammation and innate and adaptive immunity in various settings, suggesting a potential therapeutic use in COVID-19 (Sorokin et al., 2020). Therefore, ApoA-I can inhibit the activity of monocytes (Hyka et al., 2001; Smythies et al., 2010), inhibit the cross talk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells in terms of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 (Kim et al., 2005), decrease T-lymphocyte activation by activated macrophages (Hyka et al., 2001), and reduce the inflammatory response of type II pneumocytes to a viral challenge (van Lenten et al., 2004). In mice, an ApoA-I mimetic reduced the severity of influenza\u0002related pneumonia (van Lenten et al., 2002). Very recently, Kelesidis et al. (2021) reported that the ApoA-I mimetic peptide 4F attenuates in vitro the replication of SARS-CoV\u00022 and associated apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation (IL-6 production) in epithelial cells. CER-001 is an engineered, pre-\u03b2 HDL particle that contains human recombinant ApoA-1 together with natural phospholipids, combined into a single small discoidal particle (Keyserling et al., 2017). CER-001 was formerly developed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, but we recently reported that it can be proposed in patients with inherited lecithin-cholesterol-acyl-transferase deficiency to prevent kidney disease progression (Faguer et al., 2021). A preliminary study by Tanaka et al. (2022) reported a good tolerance of CER\u0002001 in a critically ill patient with severe COVID-19 and secondary infection and a reduction in inflammatory markers. In addition, native HDL may exert a potent antiviral effect against SARS-Cov-2 (Cho et al., 2021). Altogether, these findings put forward the hypothesis that ApoA-I supplementation may prevent the progression of COVID-19 toward critical forms and/or reverse the cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we aimed to assess the tolerance of ApoA-I supplementation in four critically ill individuals who developed a COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory state and were included in an ApoA-I compassionate-access program. As a secondary objective, their outcomes were reported. Patients and methods Approval and patients\u2019 inclusion The four patients included in this study were treated at the University Hospital of Toulouse (France) under a compassionate use program that was approved by the French Agency for the Safety of Drugs and Health Products (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des Produits de Sant\u00e9 [ANSM]; Frontiers in Pharmacology 02 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 authorization #2021-104249; #2022-107250; #2022-108293; #2022-108518). All patients provided informed consent to receive CER-001 and to be included in the Nephrogene Biobank which was approved by the French National Ethical Review Board (DC-2011-1388). The study was conducted from 15 December 2021 to 31 January 2022. Patients had documented COVID-19 (nasopharyngeal PCR) and hyperinflammatory state characterized by a serum level of ferritin higher than 1000 \u03bcg/L and inflammation-related organ injury (respiratory failure, coma, cytopenia, and hepatitis). They were also characterized by an ApoA-I serum level below 0.9 g/L (normal value > 1.1 g/L). Drugs delivery CER-001 was generously offered by Abionyx Pharma. Abionyx Pharma had no access to the data during the treatment period and did not participate in the article writing. Standard-of-care treatment was pursued, as appropriate. Clinical follow-up Patients were followed up throughout their hospitalization stay and underwent physical examinations and routine blood sampling (complete blood count, arterial blood gases, inflammatory markers, kidney and liver functions, and lipid tests). Cytokine measurements (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1) were performed immediately before and at several time points after the first administration of CER-001, using the ELLA nanofluidic system (Bio-Techne, France). Clinical and biological characteristics prior to and following CER-001 administration were compared descriptively. The major endpoints were survival and adverse events (safety part of the study). The secondary endpoints were the length of hospitalization, the evolution of inflammatory parameters (ferritin and cytokines), and the oxygen supports in patients with ARDS. Results Cases histories Patient 1 was a 52-year-old male patient with a history of IgA vasculitis, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease and had received a kidney transplant in 2018. He had been given three doses of mRNA vaccine but developed only weak anti-SARS\u0002CoV-2 immunity (anti-spike antibodies 15.5 BAU/mL). He developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 17 December 2021 (fever, diarrhea, and dyspnea) and was admitted to the hospital on December 25. Oxygen saturation was 92% in room air, and oxygen supplementation was started (1 L/min). The chest CT scan showed a bilateral interstitial lung disease compatible with COVID-19 (parenchyma extension 25%). Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (variant-of\u0002concern (VOC) Delta). Blood tests showed a hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 5,037 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 34 mg/L), liver test abnormalities (AST and ALT 2.5 and 3.5 times the upper limit normal (ULN) values, respectively), and thrombocytopenia. Tacrolimus was pursued, mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn, and dexamethasone was introduced (6 mg/day) with antibiotics. On day 2, the blood tests showed pancytopenia and progression of the hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 6,870 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 55 mg/L). He received one infusion of the monoclonal anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab (8 mg/kg i.v.) and one infusion of neutralizing monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (casirimivab/ imdevimab). On day 4, ferritin increased to 19,219 \u03bcg/L, AST and ALT increased to 17 and 14 times the ULN values, respectively, and arterial lactates were at 2.7 mmol/L. Bone marrow aspirate showed features of hemophagocytosis. Blood PCR of SARS-CoV-2 was weakly positive. Worsening hypoxia required increased oxygenation (4 L/min; PaO2 62 mmHg), and the CT scan showed progressive lung lesions typical of COVID\u000219 (50% of the parenchyma). Despite increasing dexamethasone to 10 mg/day, serum triglycerides and ferritin increased to 3.2 mmol/L and 27,394 \u03bcg/L, respectively, on day 6. Patient 2 was a 38-year-old female patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and being overweight and had received a kidney transplant in 2011. She had been given three doses of mRNA vaccine but developed no anti-SARS-CoV\u00022 immunity. She developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 4 January 2022 (cough, chills, diarrhea, and fever) and was admitted to the transplantation ward on January 14. Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (VOC Omicron). Upon admission, SaO2 was 94% while receiving 9 L/min of oxygen with a facial mask. The chest CT scan showed typical lesions of COVID-19 (extension 50%). Blood tests showed hepatitis with cytolysis and cholestasis (7\u201310 times the ULN values, respectively), acute kidney injury (KDIGO stage 1), and hyperinflammation (ferritin 2,000 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 107 mg/L). High-flow oxygen supplementation, awake prone position, dexamethasone (10 mg/day), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg once), and antibiotics were started. Everolimus was withdrawn, and tacrolimus was pursued. On day 4, despite full\u0002code therapy, high-flow oxygen supplementation was still required, and the hyperinflammatory state worsened (ferritin 2,800 \u03bcg/L). Patient 3 was a 47-year-old female patient with a history of diabetes mellitus, adrenal Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hypertension, and end-stage kidney disease requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy since 2020. She did not receive anti\u0002SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and had no anti-SARS-CoV\u00022 immunity at the time of admission to the hospital. She developed symptoms of COVID-19 on 15 January 2022 Frontiers in Pharmacology 03 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 (cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and fever) and was admitted to the hospital on January 19. Nasopharyngeal PCR identified SARS-CoV-2 (VOC Omicron). The chest CT scan showed mild to moderate lung lesions typical of COVID-19 (10%\u2013 25%). She did not require oxygen supplementation. Blood tests showed hyperinflammatory syndrome (ferritin 4,350 \u03bcg/L and C-reactive protein 55 mg/L) with a moderate increase in AST and ALT (2 and 1.5 times the ULN values, respectively) and mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. Dexamethasone (6 mg/day) was introduced. On day 3, hyperferritinemia (4,142 \u03bcg/L) and liver test abnormalities persisted, and she developed encephalopathy leading to admission to the intensive care unit. Patient 4 was a 59-year-old male patient with a history of hepatitis B, liver transplantation in 2006, HHV8-negative Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (complete remission), and end-stage kidney disease requiring chronic kidney replacement therapy since 2020. He had received three doses of mRNA vaccines but developed no anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Owing to familial exposure to SARS-CoV-2, nasopharyngeal PCR was performed on 6 January 2022, identifying the VOC Omicron variant. He developed symptoms of COVID-19 on January 15 (asthenia) but had no respiratory symptoms. The chest CT scan showed mild to moderate lung lesions typical of COVID-19 (10%\u2013 25%). On January 17, dyspnea, cough, and fever developed. Upon admission, PaO2 was 54 mmHg in room air, his respiratory rate was 30 cycles/min, and body temperature was 38.5\u00b0 C. Blood tests showed hyperferritinemia (1,223 \u03bcg/ L) and leukopenia (1,080 cells/mm3 ). A CT scan showed progression of lung lesions (25%\u201350%). Oxygen supplementation, dexamethasone (10 mg/day), tocilizumab (8 mg/kg, once), antibiotics, and fresh frozen plasma from convalescent patients were given. Mycophenolate mofetil was withdrawn, and tacrolimus was pursued. On day 5, acute respiratory failure developed requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with neuromuscular blocking. Blood tests showed a hyperinflammatory state (ferritin 4,535 \u03bcg/L) with increased AST and ALT (three times the ULN values). At that time, the bronchoalveolar fluid culture was negative, suggestive of critical COVID-19 only. The PaO2 to FiO2 ratio was in the range of 150\u2013180. Antibiotics were pursued. Dosing According to the available information regarding its safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (Keyserling et al., 2017), CER-001 was given intravenously over 0.5\u20131 h at a dose of 10 mg/kg at hours 0 and 12 (patient 1) and hours 0, 12, 24, and 48 (patients 2, 3, and 4). In order to address the safety of the procedure, patient 1 received only two infusions of CER\u0002001, whereas patients 2\u20134 received four infusions. Administration was preceded by anti-histaminic prophylaxis with hydroxyzine (50 mg i.v.). In all patients, dexamethasone was pursued. General safety Patients 1, 2, and 3 did not develop any serious adverse events. Patient 4 developed two episodes of ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus plus mucormycosis) and one bacteremia (Staphylococcus haemolyticus). Bioefficacy: lipid profiles As shown in Figure 1, all four patients had very low serum levels of ApoA-I (range 0.74\u20130.79 mg/L, normal value > 1.1 g/ L) and HDL (range 0.26\u20130.35, normal value > 0.45 g/L) and high serum levels of triglycerides (range 2.16\u20133.4 g/L, normal value < 1.5 g/L) when CER-001 was started. Lipid tests were not available at the time of admission to the hospital. Following infusion of CER-001, ApoA-I and HDL levels normalized in all patients at day 2 but remained in the lower range of the normal values in most inflammatory patients. In patient 4, who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia 3 days after the start of CER-001, ApoA-I subsequently decreased below the normal values. Inflammation kinetic At baseline, IL-1\u03b2 was normal in all individuals, IL-6 was increased in the three patients who previously received tocilizumab and was normal in the latter (3.3\u20131,295 pg/ml), and TNF-\u03b1 was moderately increased (9.7\u201342.1 pg/ml). IL-8 was the only inflammatory cytokine universally increased (>10 pg/ml; 14.8\u201364.5 pg/ml) (Figure 1). Following CER-001, IL-8 normalized in patients 1, 2, and 3. In patient 4, IL-8 decreased immediately after the injections and re-increased at the time of a ventilator-associated pneumonia. Serum levels of ferritin decreased from 6,616 \u00b1 8,696 to 1,712 \u00b1 815 \u03bcg/L, 6 days after the start of CER-001. The administration of anti-IL6R antibodies before CER-001 in 3 out of 4 patients precluded the analysis of C-reactive protein. Body temperature remained below 37.5\u00b0 in all patients. Clinical outcomes CER-001 administration was followed by a rapid improvement of the clinical condition of patients 1, 2, and 3, allowing them to be discharged from the hospital 3\u20134 days after the CER-001 infusions (Figure 1). In patients 1 and 2, oxygen Frontiers in Pharmacology 04 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 supplementation was withdrawn 2 and 3 days after the administration, respectively. In patient 3, confusion resolved within 2 days. In these three patients, inflammatory parameters, liver tests, and blood cell count improved until discharge. Patient 4 received mechanical ventilation for 3 days when CER-001 was introduced. After a first phase of improvement (neuromuscular blocker withdrawal and sedation lightening) for 3 days, he secondarily developed several ventilator-associated pneumonia infections and ultimately died 1 month later. These infections were considered unrelated to the CER-001 treatment. Discussion In this study, we reported the outcomes of four individuals with COVID-19-induced cytokine storm who received ApoA-I supplementation as salvage therapy. In addition to a very good FIGURE 1 Outcomes of four individuals with the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm who received CER-001 as salvage therapy. DXM, dexamethasone; TCZ, tocilizumab; ApoA-I, apolipoprotein-A-I; IL-8, interleukin-8; TNF-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1; IL-6, inteleukin-6. Frontiers in Pharmacology 05 frontiersin.org Faguer et al. 10.3389/fphar.2022.936659 acute tolerance of CER-001, as already observed in other settings outside critical care units (Nicholls et al., 2018; Faguer et al., 2021), we observed a rapid improvement in respiratory status, a decrease in inflammatory parameters, and the normalization of blood cell counts, paralleling the normalization of ApoA-I levels after CER-001 in 3 out of 4 patients. On the contrary, they developed critical COVID-19-related cytokine storm, and they could be discharged home, without oxygen support, as soon as 3\u20134 days after CER-001 infusions. After the completion of this compassionate-use access, Tanaka et al. (2022) also reported a case of severe COVID-19 in which CER-001 administration was followed by a dramatic decrease of inflammatory parameters during infusion. These preliminary clinical results and data obtained in vitro (Kelesidis et al., 2021) strongly support the development of a randomized double\u0002blind clinical trial testing CER-001 in patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19, especially in those more at risk of developing a critical disease. Several studies have reported that ApoA-I and HDL-C are less abundant in COVID-19 patients (Poynard et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; Begue et al., 2021; Hilser et al., 2021), especially in the most severe forms, and that HDL-C from COVID-19 patients is less protective in endothelial cells submitted to inflammatory triggers and does not protect them from apoptosis (Begue et al., 2021). Low serum levels of ApoA-I may increase both the risk of developing COVID-19 (Poynard et al., 2020) and the risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 (Begue et al., 2021). Such a decrease in ApoA-I or HDL-C is a common finding in cytokine storms and was observed in virus-induced and familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (Henter et al., 1991; Kraskovsky et al., 2021) and in dengue shock syndrome (Marin-Palma et al., 2019). Thus, the results derived from this study may potentially be valid in other settings of hyperinflammatory states. Beyond its potential ability to prevent severe forms of COVID-19, ApoA-I also modulates virologic control by hosts and their immune responses against various viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus and dengue virus) (Srinivas et al., 1990; Coelho et al., 2021). Our data thus support future trials in other forms of virus-induced hyperinflammatory states, like viral HLHs or dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome. Among the various inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 was the only cytokine that was universally increased (>10 pg/ml), confirming its ability to identify patients developing critical COVID-19 (Kessel et al., 2021). IL-6 was also increased though the previous use of tocilizumab which precluded firm conclusions (Nishimoto et al., 2008). Our proof-of-concept study was not designed to distinguish whether hyperinflammation and COVID-19 were indeed reversed by the ApoA-I supplementation itself or whether it was only a fortuitous association, but, following CER-001, we observed a rapid decrease in IL-8 in the three patients with a favorable outcome, paralleling the clinical and biological improvement. In patient 4, after a first phase of clinical improvement accompanied by ApoA-I normalization and IL-8 decrease, ventilation-associated pneumonia and clinical deterioration were accompanied by C-reactive protein and IL-8 increase and ApoA-I decrease. In this study, patients received four infusions of CER-001 (10 mg/kg), but the use of a higher dose for the first injection (e.g., 15 mg/kg) may help reach the optimal concentrations of ApoA-I and non-oxidized HDL more rapidly to achieve maximal therapeutic effects. Also, the pharmacokinetic of CER-001 has only been described in healthy individuals (Keyserling et al., 2017). In a phase 1 clinical study, a 10 mg/kg dose led to an increase of ApoA-I in the range of 0.1\u20130.2 g/L in the first 12 h followed by rapid normalization (Keyserling et al., 2017) that prompted us to inject CER-001 at hours 0, 12, 24, and 48 to reach optimal values of blood ApoA\u0002I in a setting of low baseline values. Whether its half-life is extended in critically ill patients with liver failure is currently unknown. This study has several limitations including its uncontrolled design and the small size of the cohort which could be included in the compassionate access program. This did not allow us to identify COVID-19 patients with the highest probability to benefit from CER-001 and whether specific sub-phenotypes (according to the degree of inflammation, vasculopathy, or other parameters to be determined) may better respond to ApoA-1 supplementation. This will require additional analyses on larger cohorts. Second, one patient had a COVID-19 hyperinflammatory state but not respiratory failure. Our purpose was first to confirm the feasibility and tolerance of ApoA-I supplementation in the setting of critically ill COVID\u000219 patients. Here, we report the rapid improvement of some patients with COVID-19 ARDS or a hyperinflammatory state. Conclusion In summary, this pilot uncontrolled exploratory compassionate study provides initial safety and proof-of\u0002concept data from patients with a COVID-19 cytokine storm receiving ApoA-I. Further randomized controlled trial evaluation is now required to ascertain whether ApoA-I has any beneficial effects on patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm.

A case of bullous pemphigoid provoked by doxycycline-induced phototoxicity. JAAD Case Reports. 2023;37:41-4 on 14 Jun 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United States of America and concerns a 64-year-old male patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of bullous pemphigoid and drug-induced phototoxicity associated with doxycycline. The patient with a history of vascular graft surgery, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presented with a pruritic and tender blistering rash for 14 days. He had undergone vascular graft surgery 3 months prior and was started on doxycycline as prophylaxis for infection. He then returned to Mexico, where he lives and teaches surfing. Unaware of the risks associated with this medication, he did not use photoprotection despite long days in sun wearing only swim trunks, and developed a confluent red, pruritic rash in sun exposed areas 1 month after starting doxycycline, thought to be phototoxicity. He was switched from doxycycline to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and limited sun exposure. He subsequently developed diarrhea and discontinued amoxicillin-clavulanic acid after 3 weeks (please refer linked case# US-MLMSERVICE-20230615-4352920-1). Despite discontinuing antibiotics, the diffuse erythema persisted. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the rash became painful and blistered. Dermatologic exam was notable for diffusely scattered tense vesicles and bullae on large erythematous plaques and few scattered weeping crusted erosions on the scalp, neck, upper torso, arms, hands including palms, and thighs to mid-calf. Mucosal involvement was not detected. His other medications included metoprolol, aspirin, clopidogrel, and simvastatin, all of which had been stable for 2 years. Cilostazol was started one and a half months prior to rash onset. Biopsy of lesion skin for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and perilesional skin for direct immunofluorescence was performed on the upper portion of the right arm. H&E staining demonstrated a clean, subepidermal split and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate containing lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils in the superficial dermis. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrated linear deposition of C3 and IgG along the basement membrane zone (BMZ), with a salt-split study showing linear deposition of IgG along the roof of the blister and linear deposition of C3 on the roof and floor of the induced blister. Indirect immunofluorescence was notable for positive IgG on monkey esophagus (1:640) and positive IgG on human split skin substrate (1:1280), while an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay study demonstrated a positive IgG BP antigen 180 antibody level (106 U/mL; normal/negative: <9 U/mL) and negative IgG bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen 230 antibody level (6 U/mL), confirming a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid (BP). The patient was started on 1 mg/kg/day of by mouth prednisone and clobetasol ointment twice a day. After BP was confirmed, he was started on niacinamide 500 mg by mouth three times a day and IV immunoglobulin 2 g/kg over 4 days. Doxycycline was not initiated due to concern for this being an inciting factor. One day after starting IV immunoglobulin, he reported improvement of his symptoms, including itching and pain. The patient was continued on prednisone and niacinamide at the time of discharge and subsequently tapered off prednisone and started on 500 mg of mycophenolate mofetil twice a day. At 2-month follow-up he continued this regimen with no blister recurrence. Based on the timing and sequence of events and the photo-distributed nature of his lesions, It was believed that doxycycline-induced phototoxicity played an integral role in the development of BP in this patient.

Abstract Background: Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is a challenging diagnosis with a particu\u0002larly poor prognosis, even after curative surgery (median survival: <30 months). The prog\u0002nosis of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BR-PDC) is even worse. We describe a  patient with BR-PDC who achieved stable disease with metronomic chemotherapy after  refusing surgery.  Case presentation: A 75-year-old woman was presented with jaundice and epigastric  pain. Imaging confirmed a mass in the pancreatic head encasing the superior mesen\u0002teric vein, with obstruction of the pancreatic and bile ducts. After stenting to relieve the  obstruction, Fine needle aspiration (FNA) confirmed the diagnosis of PDC. The patient  refused surgery and radiation therapy but agreed for chemotherapy. After the second  cycle of mFOLFIRINOX \u2013 complicated by febrile neutropenia \u2013 she refused further  IV therapy. Genomic profiling revealed KIT amplification. Therefore, she was started  on imatinib with dramatic improvement both clinically and biochemically reflected in  carbohydrate antigen 19-9 drop. However, that response was short-lived at 3 months.  Therefore, capecitabine was added at a low dose of 1 g bid on an alternate weekly basis.  The patient did well and she is currently alive with a stable disease as of 2 years after  diagnosis. Conclusion: Metronomic chemotherapy, especially capecitabine added to the targeted  therapy, imatinib, is a potentially useful treatment for PDC where no other options are  available, especially those harbouring no mutation in the dominant four genes. Indeed,  the absence of mutation with KIT amplification could be a potential marker for improved  outcomes with targeted and metronomic therapy, which deserves further evaluation in a  clinical trial setting. Keywords: pancreatic cancer, metronomic chemotherapy, molecular profiling, KIT  amplification Introduction Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC) is currently one of the leading causes of morbidity and  mortality attributed to cancer worldwide. The rising burden is expected to move it to the  Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 2 second leading cause of worldwide cancer death by 2030 [1]. Most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease [2] where  the mainstay of treatment is systemic chemotherapy [3]. Therefore, the prognosis remains poor with a median 5-year survival rate of just  10%, despite some improvement in therapeutic options [4]. Even those patients presenting with localised PDC who undergo surgery with  or without adjuvant therapy will develop metastatic disease and rarely achieve a disease-free survival (DFS) of more than 2 years. Therefore,  surgery alone is not sufficient for cure, and occult micrometastases are likely to be present at the time of diagnosis. These observations  motivated the adoption of treatment sequencing, which includes neoadjuvant systemic therapy+/\u2212 radiation therapy and the application of  surgery to the population of patients with stable or responding disease, most likely to receive clinical benefit from such large operations [5].  For patients who cannot tolerate or progress on conventional chemotherapy, very few options remain. Radiation therapy is associated with  significant morbidity, especially among the elderly [6]. Advances in precision medicine for PDCs according to the genetics and molecular  biology of this disease are promising approaches to overcome the heterogeneity of different patients and improve survival outcomes for this  poorly prognostic disease. Only 25% harbour actionable molecular alterations, leaving the rest in need of other innovative approaches [7].  Conventional chemotherapy toxicity prompted the development of the concept of metronomic chemotherapy [8]. Metronomic therapy  entails continuous administration of a drug, without long break-off therapy, but at lower doses than those used for conventional schedule  [9]. The metronomic approach is convenient when the goal is to control disease while maintaining the quality of life in a fragile patient [10].  This approach is not yet the standard of care in any tumour despite its popularity; therefore, most aspects of this approach are determined  by the physician according to the patient performance status and the tumour characteristics, including the choice of a chemotherapeutic  agent, the dose and the schedule [11, 12]. Here, we report a case of localised pancreatic adenocarcinoma harbouring KIT amplification, demonstrating an exceptional response to initial  standard chemotherapy, followed by stabilisation on imatinib and capecitabine maintenance. Case report A 75-year-old woman was hospitalised for management of obstructive jaundice and intermittent epigastric pain in August 2020. Contrast\u0002enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, encasing the superior mesenteric vein (Figure 1a and b). Posi\u0002tron emission tomography CT further delineated a mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (size = 4.1 * 3.6 cm; SUV = 18.2) without a clear  boundary with the duodenum. However, no distant metastases were detected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilatation of  the common bile duct, and an EBD tube was placed to drain the bile. The brush biopsy was unremarkable for malignancy. CT-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass was concordant with adenocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable PDC.  The tumour marker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was mildly elevated at 50.3 U/mL. After discussion, the multiple disciplinary teams  recommended induction therapy followed by surgery, but she refused both surgery and radiation therapy and agreed only to chemotherapy.

Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 3 Figure 2. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrating the stability of the mass at the head of the pancreas without further progression, or distant metastases.  Chemotherapy was commenced with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin). The first cycle was uneventful, but the  second cycle was complicated by hospital admission for the management of diarrhoea, dehydration and urosepsis. The patient refused any  further intravenous chemotherapy. She was willing, however, to try other oral options. Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy to perform next generation sequencing of the cell-free DNA (Guardant 360 CDX) was  requested. The test detected KIT amplification at a plasma copy number of 2.2. The tumour was microsatellite stable. Given the patient\u2019s willingness to attempt new treatments that could provide her relief and improve her quality of life, treatment with KIT  inhibitor was discussed and agreed to start, which had never been attempted in this population of patients. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibi\u0002tor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA), and c-KIT, was started on a 400-mg daily dosage  [13]. Imatinib was chosen considering its ready availability and reasonable price as compared to other potential targeted therapeutics for  c-KIT. In addition, it is a quite tolerable option. On a follow-up consultation a month after the start of treatment, the patient reported feeling  well, her performance status improved to ECOG 0, and CA19-9 dropped to 7.  Three months after commencing maintenance imatinib (5 months after her initial diagnosis), imaging revealed an excellent ongoing response  with stable disease. However, biochemical progression was evident in rising CA19-9 up to 117, possibly representing a resistant clonal popu\u0002lation. Because she refused intravenous therapy, capecitabine was added to the ongoing imatinib therapy, at a reduced dose of 1 g bid \u00d7 1  week alternating with 1 week break off therapy. An alternate week schedule was used to improve tolerability as the patient developed GII/ III \u2018Hand-Foot syndrome\u2019. Since imatinib was well tolerated, we continued imatinib with capecitabine. Ongoing therapy with imatinib and capecitabine has been well tolerated, and she remains clinically well with excellent PS. CA19-9 dropped  down to 11. Imaging at 16 months after the addition of capecitabine (20 months after her initial diagnosis) has revealed stable disease, with  no metastatic disease on CT imaging (Figure 2). The patient described in this report provided informed written consent for the collection and publication of her deidentified data \u2013 clinical,  molecular and images \u2013 from her medical records. Discussion Systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for PDC, an aggressive tumour with a typically advanced presentation [3]. Different regimens,  tailored to the performance status of the patient, are recommended by current guidelines, but none is tailored to the underlying molecular  alterations of the tumour [14]. Hence, the modest palliative effects of conventional chemotherapy, regardless of several cytotoxic drugs are  combined. Usually, this therapy is associated with significant morbidity that negatively affects the quality of life. Even for those with poten\u0002tially resectable disease, the likelihood of successful surgery after induction therapy for patients with resectable, borderline resectable, locally  Case Report ecancer 2023, 17:1535; www.ecancer.org; DOI: https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2023.1535 4 advanced type A, and locally advanced type B disease is approximately 90%, 75%, 60%, and 25%, respectively [5]. Our patient, therefore,  made the decision not to undergo surgery and to get a treatment that does not impair her QoL.  Recently, it has been demonstrated that four frequently mutated genes: KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A (p16) and SMAD4 dominate the genetic  landscape of PDC [15]. The number of mutations among the major four driver genes was substantially associated with OS and DFS [16].  The fewer mutations displayed by PDAC, the better the prognostic outcome in 71 patients who underwent a radical operation followed by  adjuvant chemotherapy, with better OS predicted among those with zero to two mutated genes [17]. Our patient\u2019s tumour displayed no  mutation in any of those genes, consistent with the improved outcome. Response to imatinib was excellent, as predicted by its reported  inhibitory effect in pancreatic cancer cell lines [18]. Overexpression of multiple tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and their ligands has  been described in pancreatic cancer cells, possibly supporting pancreatic cancer cell growth in a redundant manner. Imatinib inhibitory effect  in pancreatic cancer cell lines did not impact growth factor-induced receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation,  possibly contributing to a short-lived response, as observed in our patient [18]. Repeat genomic testing was not attempted as it was too  soon to repeat, within 3 months of therapy; especially since it was expensive and the patient herself was paying for her treatment. Similarly,  mutational analysis was not requested due to the likelihood of low yield, in light of KIT amplification rather than a mutation in the original  specimen.  5-FU has been the cornerstone of treatments for gastrointestinal cancer. There are a number of different treatment schedules in which it is  used in different dose schemes without any definite differences in various non-inferiority studies [19], making the drug an ideal candidate  to be used as metronomic chemotherapy. Another unique advantage is its antiangiogenic properties when administered continuously at low  doses [18]. Therefore, we elected to start capecitabine as metronomic therapy to control the resistant clone/s. We took that approach in  an attempt to reduce adverse events, including financial toxicity, and overcome resistance to conventional therapy [8]. Tolerability has been  demonstrated in clinical trials [20]. Our patient did very well and was able to go on this schedule while maintaining an excellent quality of  life. Metronomic treatment has previously been tested on breast cancer and prostate cancer, but the experience is less in the case of gastro\u0002intestinal cancer. Positive results have been demonstrated in colorectal cancer, oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, biliary and liver cancer  [10, 11, 21, 22].  Conclusion We report a locally advanced PDC patient who harbours KIT amplification with an exceptional response to targeted and metronomic therapy.  Liquid biopsy was a great asset to offer our patient an option tailored to the particular tumour she has. It revealed the biology of the specific  tumour under care, in light of the aforementioned molecular data [16]. Otherwise, she would have been on supportive care without any  tumour-targeted therapy. The observed efficacy of this approach after first-line therapy draws attention to the importance of incorporat\u0002ing specific molecular characteristics of the tumour when making therapeutic decisions. More importantly, it emphasises the significance of  addressing the heterogeneity of PDC when designing clinical trials as a means to overcome the poor prognosis of PDC and develop subtype\u0002specific recommendations. Indeed, the absence of mutations with KIT amplification could possibly be a marker for improved outcomes with  imatinib and metronomic therapy in patients with PDC. However, this is only one case with interesting clinical activity of the approach that  merits further exploration in a clinical trial setting. In addition, it is a possible strategy when no other option is available. Conflicts of interest None. Funding No funding for this research was obtained from public or private sectors.

Durable effect of imatinib and metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine in pancreatic carcinoma. Ecancer medical science. 2023;17:1535 on 19 May 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Jordan and concerns a 75-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse drug reactions of diarrhoea, dehydration, urosepsis and febrile neutropenia associated with folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The patient was hospitalized for management of obstructive jaundice and intermittent epigastric pain in August 2020. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, encasing the superior mesenteric vein. Positron emission tomography CT further delineated a mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas (size = 4.1 * 3.6 cm; SUV = 18.2) without a clear boundary with the duodenum. However, no distant metastases were detected. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed dilatation of the common bile duct, and an EBD tube was placed to drain the bile. The brush biopsy was unremarkable for malignancy. CT-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of the pancreatic mass was concordant with adenocarcinoma, and the patient was diagnosed with potentially resectable Pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC). The tumour marker, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was mildly elevated at 50.3 U/mL. After discussion, the multiple disciplinary teams recommended induction therapy followed by surgery, but she refused both surgery and radiation therapy and agreed only to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was commenced with modified FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin/5-FU/irinotecan/oxaliplatin). The first cycle was uneventful, but the second cycle was complicated by hospital admission for the management of diarrhoea, dehydration and urosepsis. This was also further complicated by febrile neutropenia. The patient refused any further intravenous chemotherapy. She was willing, however, to try other oral options. Comprehensive genomic profiling using liquid biopsy to perform next generation sequencing of the cell-free DNA (Guardant 360 CDX) was requested. The test detected KIT amplification at a plasma copy number of 2.2. The tumour was microsatellite stable. Given the patient\u2019s willingness to attempt new treatments that could provide her relief and improve her quality of life, treatment with KIT inhibitor was discussed and agreed to start, which had never been attempted in this population of patients. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRA), and c-KIT, was started on a 400-mg daily dosage. Imatinib was chosen considering its ready availability and reasonable price as compared to other potential targeted therapeutics for c-KIT. In addition, it is a quite tolerable option. On a follow-up consultation a month after the start of treatment, the patient reported feeling well, her performance status improved to ECOG 0, and CA19-9 dropped to 7. Three months after commencing maintenance imatinib (5 months after her initial diagnosis), imaging revealed an excellent ongoing response with stable disease. However, biochemical progression was evident in rising CA19-9 up to 117, possibly representing a resistant clonal population. Because she refused intravenous therapy, capecitabine was added to the ongoing imatinib therapy, at a reduced dose of 1 g bid \u00d7 1 week alternating with 1 week break off therapy. An alternate week schedule was used to improve tolerability as the patient developed GII/III \u2018Hand-Foot syndrome\u2019 (Also refer linked case # JO-MLMSERVICE-20230523-4302043-1). Since imatinib was well tolerated, we continued imatinib with capecitabine. Ongoing therapy with imatinib and capecitabine has been well tolerated, and she remains clinically well with excellent PS. CA19-9 dropped down to 11. Imaging at 16 months after the addition of capecitabine (20 months after her initial diagnosis) has revealed stable disease, with no metastatic disease on CT imaging.

Several factors  such as the pre- and postpartum periods, trauma, hypertension, vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia,  and the use of contraceptives may potentially relate to this phenomenon, yet this patient did not pos\u0002sess any of them. The most common profile is a middle-aged woman with few cardiovascular risk  factors. Case report: 60-year-old woman, smoker with history of untreated arterial hypertension, hyperlipi\u0002demia presented with retrosternal chest pain duration for 2 hours. Initial 12-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG) showed elevated ST-segment in leads V4 to V6 and D1 and aVL. Patient received a loading dose  of aspirin and ticagrelor and was transferred to a tertiary hospital for a coronary angiography which  showed a subocclusively altered distal segment of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) up to the  apex. Based on coronary angiography, it was concluded that it is most likely an intramural hema\u0002toma possibly caused by fibromuscular dysplasia. It was recommended to do a recoronarography in  two months and to continue with dual antiplatelet therapy. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed  normal global systolic function of the left ventricle with hypocontractility of the lateral wall. The pa\u0002tient was discharged after a few days in a very good condition. After two months recoronarography  was performed which showed complete recanalization of the apical LAD. CT angiography of the renal  arteries and supraaortic branches were also performed where no changes were found that would indi\u0002cate fibromuscular dysplasia. The patient does not have chest pain anymore and she tolerates physical  exertion well. Conclusion: Diagnosis and treatment of intramural hematoma of the coronary artery is very challeng\u0002ing, because it is an overlooked diagnosis. Catheter-based angiography is validated for the diagnosis  of coronary intramural hematoma. In a stable patient conservative approach is preferred because an  intramural hematoma heals spontaneously. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for  one year is recommended followed by using aspirin alone indefinitely. LITERATURE 1. Moidy M, Al Kindi F.

Lactic acidosis by metformin, management with different strategies of renal replacement. Medicina Interna de Mexico. 2022;38(2):457-66 on 16 May 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Mexico and concerns a 63-year-old male patient (case-2) who experienced serious adverse drug reactions of hyperlactataemic metabolic acidosis, hypotensive, bradycardic, extensive subendocardial injury to the anterior wall, increased anion gap, increased drug levels and drug toxicity associated with metformin increased concentrations. The patient with significant history including systemic arterial hypertension over the past 20 years, ischemic heart disease over the past 20 years treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, and type II diabetes over the past 20 years treated with metformin at unspecified doses. He was admitted to the Accident & Emergency Department due to severe abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Upon physical examination, he was found to be hemodynamically stable, hypotensive, and bradycardic. The patient subsequently required advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers, orotracheal intubation, and treatment with vasoactive amine therapy; sinus rhythm was obtained after 2 cycles, with electrocardiogram data suggestive of extensive subendocardial injury to the anterior wall. Arterial blood gas analysis of the patient found a mixed acid-base disturbance, characterized by pure hyperlactataemic metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap not corrected for albumin of 45.43, no compensation for respiratory acidosis with expected CO2 of 14.15 \u00b1 2, calculated using Winter\u2019s formula. Lactate 15 mmol/L and delta-delta 4.8 (calculated with ideal ABG of 12, ideal HCO3 of 24 mmol/L, and multiplying the final result by 0.6^6 compatible with pure metabolic disorder). Upon admission, central laboratory tests revealed that the patient had an MDRD-6 formula estimated glomerular filtration rate of 4 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (glucose 180 mg/dL, BUN 129.9 mg/dL, urea 278 mg/dL, creatinine 14.54 mg/dL, uric acid 17.7 mg/dL, albumin 3.69 g/dL, calcium 9.5 mEq/L, phosphorus 11.55 mEq/L, sodium 138 mEq/L, potassium 5.53 mEq/L, chlorine 94 mEq/L). The decision was made to initiate renal replacement therapy with intermittent hemodialysis due to the severity of the initial treatment-refractory acidosis for approximately 5.5 hours; this was well tolerated, and partially relieved the acidosis; therefore, the decision was made to monitor the patient hourly, with performance of hourly venous blood gas measurements; a rebound and increased metabolic acidosis was observed one hour after completion of the first hemodialysis session. The decision was made to restart renal replacement therapy (IDH) for approximately 8 hours; metabolic acidosis relief was achieved again. Arterial blood gas control samples, including lactate concentrations, from the patient\u2019s admission and during intermittent haemodialysis therapy was provided as: 10:06 a.m. 21/03/2019: pH 6.7, PCO2 35.1, PO2 (mmHg) 55, HCO3 (mmol/L) 4.1, BE (mmol/L) -34.6, Lactate (mmol/L) 15, Dialysis modality: - 10:17 a.m. 21/03/2019: pH 6.69, PCO2 34.9, PO2 62.8, HCO3 4.0, BE -35.4, Lactate 15, Dialysis modality: - 10:35 a.m. 21/03/2019: pH 6.67, PCO2 55, PO2 59.6, HCO3 6.1, BE -32.7, Lactate 22, Dialysis modality: - 11:41 a.m. 21/03/2019: pH 6.8, PCO2 19.2, PO2 267, HCO3 2.9, BE -31.7, Lactate 22, Dialysis modality: - 1:57 p.m. (13:57) 21/03/2019: pH 6.99, PCO2 33.8, PO2 75.2, HCO3 7.9, BE -23.1, Lactate 20, Dialysis modality: - 4:23 p.m. (16:23) 21/03/2019: pH 7.23, PCO2 39.4, PO2 56.0, HCO3 16, BE -10.6, Lactate 13.5, Dialysis modality: IDH 7:03 p.m. (19:03) 21/03/2019: pH 7.36, PCO2 27.1, PO2 48.1, HCO3 15.1, BE -8.5, Lactate 10.6, Dialysis modality: IDH 8:42 p.m. (20:42) 21/03/2019: pH 7.39, PCO2 33.4, PO2 55.7, HCO3 20.1, BE -3.6, Lactate 7.8, Dialysis modality: IDH 9:53 p.m. (21:53) 21/03/2019: pH 7.43, PCO2 29.3, PO2 37.6, HCO3 19.3, BE -3.4, Lactate 6.6, Dialysis modality: IDH 11:04 p.m. (23:04) 21/03/2019: pH 7.38, PCO2 27.4, PO2 41.1, HCO3 16.1, BE -7.2, Lactate 6.7, Dialysis modality: - 11:09 p.m. (23:09) 21/03/2019: pH 7.44, PCO2 23.3, PO2 58.1, HCO3 15.6, BE -6.5, Lactate 6.5, Dialysis modality: - 00:31 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.38, PCO2 26.7, PO2 45.5, HCO3 15.6, BE -7.7, Lactate 5.6, Dialysis modality: - 1:59 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.38, PCO2 23.4, PO2 47.6, HCO3 13.6, BE -9.3, Lactate 5.2, Dialysis modality: - 2:47 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.36, PCO2 23.9, PO2 48.6, HCO3 13.4, BE -10.1, Lactate 4.5, Dialysis modality: - 3:57 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.33, PCO2 22.9, PO2 50.9, HCO3 12, BE -11.9, Lactate 4.0, Dialysis modality: - 4:59 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.32, PCO2 22.2, PO2 51.8, HCO3 11.3, BE -12.8, Lactate 3.5, Dialysis modality: - 5:58 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.30, PCO2 21, PO2 53.3, HCO3 10.2, BE -14.3, Lactate 3.1, Dialysis modality: - 6:50 a.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.28, PCO2 21.7, PO2 52.2, HCO3 10, BE -15.1, Lactate 2.9, Dialysis modality: IDH 12:31 p.m. 22/03/2019: pH 7.38, PCO2 26.7, PO2 45.5, HCO3 15.6, BE -7.7, Lactate 5.6, Dialysis modality: - 3:40 p.m. (15:40) 22/03/2019: pH 7.41, PCO2 32.3, PO2 44.0, HCO3 20.5, BE -2.7, Lactate 2.3, Dialysis modality: IDH Most cases of severe metabolic acidosis are caused by [a buildup of] lactic acid or ketones (diabetic ketoacidosis); and a lower number [of cases] are caused by [poisoning with] methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylates, or drugs, such as metformin. The standard definition of lactic acidosis is a pH < 7.35 and arterial or venous blood gas lactate concentrations exceeding 4 mmol/L. However, in cases with tissue perfusion alteration, such as in hypovolemic shock, central venous blood gas measurement of acid-base status may be more effective. An increased anion gap, particularly above 30, may be suggestive of lactic acidosis; additionally, while not specific, elevated ABG delta-delta may also [be suggestive of the disease]. Elevated lactate concentrations are caused by the accumulation of said substrate in body fluids and are associated with poor clinical prognosis. This occurs when lactate production exceeds lactate consumption, or if there is a decrease in excretion. In cases of generalized or localized tissue hypoxia, lactate [concentrations] are elevated and accumulate as a result of the mitochondrial inability to metabolize said substrate. Additionally, the concurrent presence of acidosis impedes the liver\u2019s lactate elimination ability. Hyperlactatemia has typically been divided into two [types]: type A, which is associated with hypoxia, and type B, which can be related to the toxic effects of drugs, such as metformin. In this case, metformin-induced lactic acidosis was suspected because the patient had very high lactate concentrations upon admission. The renal function of this patient was most likely diminished prior to hospital admission, due to a long significant [clinical] history of over 20 years with type II diabetes and systemic arterial hypertension. Although metformin concentrations were requested during the first hemodialysis session (12 \u03bcg/mL), the author found no other explanatory cause for such pronounced hyperlactatemia ([causes that were ruled out included] sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, mesenteric [venous] thrombosis, uremia, poisoning by another substance, etc.). The author concluded that the first step in establishing an accurate and timely diagnosis of metformin-induced lactic acidosis involves understanding the patient's most significant history, particularly any diseases that affect renal or hepatic function. Secondly, it is important to rule out any other condition with a similar manifestation to metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap when approaching diagnosis. There is no doubt that the first-line therapy for this disease is renal replacement therapy. Choosing the most adequate treatment modality depends on the availability of the various therapies, the hemodynamic status of the patient, and the costs of and experience with the various types of dialysis treatment in the different medical facilities.

Causality for event intentional product misuse is possible for suspect drugs pioglitazone and gliclazide based on convention as it can occur with the product and not due to the drug, and not related to metformin as per available information   Introduction Time in range (TIR), the time in the target range achieved during continuous blood glucose monitoring, is one of the new parameters for assessing diabetes compensation. Most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are recommended to be within the target range of 3.9-10 mmol/l and up to 5% below the target level of 3.9-10 mmol/l during continuous monitoring of blood glucose 70% or more of the time during the given monitored period.1 In at-risk and frail patients, the target ranges are looser, over 50% in the target range of 3.9-10 mmol/l and under 1% of the time in the monitored period below 3.9 mmol/l.2 Glycated hemoglobin value (HbA1c ) used for long-term evaluation of diabetes compensation has limitations in the patient\u2019s state of health, especially in the case of anemia, hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, pregnancy and some other conditions. 3 An intensified insulin regimen is a treatment that can be controlled very effectively with continuous monitoring.   Studies have also shown a very close relationship between TIR and the occurrence of microvascular complications.4 Case Report A 54-year-old male patient has been treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus for 21 years since 2001. His personal medical history includes status post nephrectomy following a car accident in the 1990s and long-term treatment for hypertension. The diagnosis of carbohydrate metabolism disorder was established on the basis of a glucose tolerance test on 3. April 2001. BMI at the time of diagnosis was 33.8 kg/m2. He did not tolerate metformin due to dyspeptic problems, and was temporarily treated with pioglitazone, even in combination with gliclazide. In 2009, cooperation with the patient deteriorated significantly, he had a number of personal problems and did not regularly take antidiabetic drugs, which led to a deterioration of short-term and long-term compensation parameters. His fasting glucose was above 12 mmol/l. At the end of the year he was hospitalized for decompensated diabetes. He was put on an intensified insulin regimen combining intermediate-acting insulin in two doses and a short-acting human analog of lispro. Diabetes compensation was not satisfactory - HbA1c 73 mmol/mol, the patient performed self-monitoring only to a very limited extent. The dose of insulin had to be gradually increased. For a solitary kidney and a number of risk factors, he was monitored by a nephrologist for a long time. In 2018, due to unsatisfactory compensation and an HbA1c  level of 83 mmol/mol, he was hospitalized again, in the intensified insulin regimen, the intermediate-acting insulin was replaced by the basal long-acting analogue glargine 100 U/ml. In 2015, the HbA1c level was still high at 70 mmol/mol, when downloading the data from the glucometer, it was found that it was measured only 7 times a month. He repeatedly educated about the need for self-monitoring and dose titration. In 2016, due to the relatively high consumption of boluses with meals and basal insulin, a change was made to lispro 200 U/ml and glargine 300 U/ml with the aim of better absorption of insulin and sparing of the subcutaneous tissue. In 2018, he was hospitalized again for hyperglycemia due to an infection with chronic lower leg ulcers as the source. In 2019, even before the COVID-19 epidemic, he came with a glycemic profile of  8.6..9.4..5.7..6.0 mmol/l, but HbA1c  even reached 109 mmol/mol at a dose of 27 units of basal insulin glargine 300 U/ml and lispro 200 U/ml 14-10-8 units in boluses. Subsequently, he stopped showing up for check-ups until finally in December 2020 he reported by telephone that he had been in the hospital for six months and had been prescribed doses of insulin glargine 24 units and lispro 14-12-12 units. According to the discharge summaries, he had progressive erysipelas with the necessity of dissection in the area of the right foot for fluctuation. He was on a combination of antibiotics. There was also a progression of findings on the solitary kidney, with progression of renal insufficiency, proteinuria was already in the nephrotic range, creatinine was 119 pmol/l. No pathological findings were detected in complete blood count. The dose of insulin was gradually titrated. As recently as March 2022, his HbA1c  was 82 mmol/mol and he was not even sure how much bolus insulin he was actually taking per meal, perhaps around 20 units per meal. He was re-educated, especially the risk of progression of kidney failure with unsatisfactory diabetes compensation was emphasized. In May 2022, HbA1c  improved to 64 mmol/mol. We equipped the patient with continuous FreeStyle Libre monitoring while dosing the insulin analog glargine 300 U/ml in the evening 32 units and lispro 200 U/ml 22-12-14 units. The results of the continuous monitoring of the patient were very motivating. In the 14-day output, he had an average blood glucose of 7.5 mmol/l, a coefficient of variation of 22.8%, a time in range (TIR) of 90%, 2% hypoglycemia of 3-3.9 mmol/l (Fig. 1). The follow-up level of HbA1c was 62 mmol/mol. Considering the slight reserves, especially in postprandial glucose, we decided to try to improve compensation even more by changing bolus insulin to the ultra-rapid analog lispro (Lyumjev). In follow-up monitoring, hyperglycemia decreased and time in range was 92% with virtually the same time below range. Mean blood glucose improved to 7.1 mmol/l, the coefficient of variation was still in the target range below 36% with dosing of 20-10-14 units in boluses and 34 units in basal insulin (Fig. 2). Hyperglycemia persisted mainly around dinnertime, which led to an adjustment of the evening bolus dose (Fig. 3).

The male patient received repeat education on the aspects of self-monitoring and adjustment of insulin doses and still had a long-term HbA1c compensation parameter in the range of unsatisfactory values. Only continuous monitoring with FreeStyle Libre affected the patient enough to improve compensation and have a time in range of 90% between 3.9-10.0 mmol/l. It is possible to try to improve even such good results, especially by focusing on what is the patient\u2019s biggest problem. In this case, it was postprandial glycemia. Changing the short-acting analog to ultra-rapid-acting lispro with meals at virtually the same dosage resulted in even further improvement in time in range. In addition, it can be assumed that the patient has the greatest reserves here. Over time, it is possible to expect a worsening of motivation and it will be necessary to adjust the dosage of bolus insulin with meals (mainly with dinner, as the monitoring control curve also shows), which the ultra-rapid-acting insulin lispro will allow. Conclusion Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have very fluctuating motivation to improve their disease. The use of continuous monitoring can substantially improve their compensation and will also help reveal reserves in therapy with an intensified insulin regimen. The case report involved postprandial glycemia that improved with the use of ultra-rapid-acting insulin lispro. This further improved the time in range and the patient achieved up to 92% in the target range between 3.9-10 mmol/l with a low incidence of hypoglycemic events and a low coefficient of variation. Working with insulin in relation to all the results that can be obtained from continuous monitoring is also a crucial procedure for patients with type 2 diabetes, which can affect the prognosis of the development of late complications.

We report the first case of endometrial cancer after yolk sac tumor with LFS. Case presentation The presented female patient underwent right adnexectomy at age 23 because of a yolk sac tumor of the ovary. At the age of 27, the patient was diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma, received cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy. Given that her personal cancer history along with a strong family history of cancer, her father passing away from lung cancer at age 48 and her grandmother dying of ovarian cancer at age 50, the patient was referred for genetic counseling and testing. Genetic screening revealed a heterozygous pathogenic TP53 c.844C > T, p.( R282 W) with NM_000546.5 variant, a class 5 (C5) variant. This is the first reported case of a yolk sac tumor accompanied by subsequent endometrial cancer that is associated with LFS. Conclusions We reported a first case of an endometrial cancer after yolk sac tumor patient with a tumor family history of harboring the germline TP53 pathogenic variation which expanded types of tumor that can be presented in patients with LFS. This case highlights the importance of genetic testing for patients with malignant tumors, as well as patients with a family history of malignant tumors. And our case highlights the necessity of screening for gynecologic tumor in LFS patients. Keywords Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Yolk sac tumor, Endometrial cancer, TP53 Background Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) tends to be a widespread, early-onset cancer associated with a germline variant in the TP53 gene, located on the 17p13.1 chromosome that codes for p53, the most commonly inactivated protein in human cancer. Germline TP53 variants most often occur in the DNA-binding domain, resulting in the production of a dysfunctional p53 protein [1]. The TP53 gene encodes a transcription factor that controls the expression of multiple genes, which activate cell cycle arrest for genomic repair or apoptosis, depending on the level of DNA damage [2]. LFS is an autosomal dominant inheritance trait, and up to 25% of LFS is caused by de novo variants [3]. Tumor occurs in multiple organ systems is the clinical feature of LFS, which appears in a young age [4, 5]. Women with this syndrome have an almost 100% risk of cancer, while men have a 73% risk of cancer [3], the former has a higher penetrance rate mainly due to breast cancer [6]. However, the association of LFS with ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer (EC) remains underexamined. The purpose of this paper is to report a case in which a patient was first diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor (YST) of the ovary, then EC, and was later found to have LFS, which might be helpful in highlighting the importance of screening and surveillance in hereditary cancer-susceptibility syndromes. Case presentation \u2022 A 28-year-old female presented with right abdominal discomfort for two weeks in 2017 (age 23) without previous gynecologic abnormalities. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14 cm solid cystic mass in the right adnexa without other imaging abnormalities (Fig. 1). The level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) had risen to 1210 ng/mL, significantly higher than normal (0\u20139 ng/mL), while other tumor markers were within the normal range. She underwent right adnexectomy in ShengJing Hospital and was finally diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor (YST) of the ovary (Fig. 2). Ovarian germ cell tumors derive from ovarian germ cells and account for approximately 20% of all ovarian neoplasms. Only 1\u20132% of ovarian germ cell Fig. 1 Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14 cm solid cystic mass in the right adnexa Fig. 2 Yolk sac tumor pathology. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained photomicrographs, with original magnification 100 \u00d7 (A) and 200 \u00d7 (B), showing that myxoid stromal tumor cells are arranged in slices and microcapsules, with some eosinophilic globules visible. Immunohistochemistry, with original magnification 100 \u00d7 (C) and 200 \u00d7 (D), showing that tumor cells with 100% staining for AFP tumors are called malignant ovarian germ cell tumors. Yolk sac tumor represents the second most common tumor in the category of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (25%) [7]. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed following results: AFP( +), CD30( \u00b1), CK( +), oct4(-), SALL4( +). Intraoperatively, an encapsulated 15.0*14.0 cm cyst was observed in the right ovary, containing viscous fluid and jelly-like substance, which was adhered to the intestinal duct. No abnormalities were found in uterus, left ovary, bilateral fallopian tubes, appendix and intestinal tube. Intraoperative frozen pathology of the right ovarian mass was reported as malignant, considering yolk sac tumor. According to the patient\u2019s age and frozen pathological results, comprehensive staging laparotomy with fertility preservation function including cytological washings, omentectomy or omental biopsy, random peritoneal biopsies, and lymph node evaluation (pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy or sampling) should be chosen. After informing the family of the frozen pathology results intraoperatively and consulting the family opinions about further surgery, they eventually refused to perform further comprehensive staging laparotomy, the operation ended up with right adnexectomy. After washing the pelvic and abdominal cavity thoroughly, the tumor without gross implantation in the pelvic cavity, omentum and appendix, the operation was not extended further. We performed CT scans of chest and abdomen a month after surgery, no metastatic images were found. She refused to receive the comprehensive staging laparotomy with fertility preservation function and received four cycles of postoperative chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) after the surgery. AFP decreased gradually after surgery and had already been in the normal range before the first chemotherapy. During the follow-up, uterine adnexal ultrasound was performed every 3 months, and abdominal CT was reviewed every 6 months. In addition to imaging examination, tumor markers were also tested and gynecological examination was performed, all of the results revealed no evidence of recurrence. However, the patient began experiencing a prolonged menstrual period that lasted for 2 months in November 2020, while her periods had been normal before. She presented to Shengjing Hospital and was diagnosed with endometrial adenocarcinoma according to the results of hysteroscopy and curettage. Pelvic examination revealed a slightly enlarged uterus. Pathology reports showed a moderately differentiated endometrial adenocarcinoma (Fig. 3), the results of IHC were protein 53 (p53) (90% +), Ki-67 (30% +), cytokeratin 8/18 (10% +), estrogen receptor (ER) (80% +), progesteron receptor (PR) (95% +), MLH1( +), PMS2( +), MSH2( +) and MSH6( +) (Table 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed thickening of the endometrium (Fig. 4A), and subsequent positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) showed fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the uterus, as well as in retroperitoneal lymph nodes, multiple lymph nodes on both sides of the pelvic walls, and pelvic peritoneum (Fig. 4B). The levels of tumor markers CA125 and HE4 were 123.8 U/mL, 165.0 pmol/L respectively. The patient underwent open cytoreductive surgery a month later, the final surgical procedures were radical hysterectomy, left adnexectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, para-aortic lymph node dissection, pelvic and abdominal foci resection, omentectomy and appendectomy, tumor was completely excised without gross residual tumor. The pathological examination revealed moderately differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma in the deep muscle layer with cervical extension, omentum, peritoneum, intestinal surface lesion, left pelvic lymph node, presacral lymph nodes, and para-aortic lymph nodes metastases. The results of IHC were ER (30% +), PR (40% +), P53 (60% +), Ki-67 (30% +), cytokeratin 8/18 (90% +), MLH1( +), PMS2( +), MSH2( +), MSH6( +) and NapsinA negative (Table 1). According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) guidelines, the patient\u2019s surgical pathological staging was IVb. Her family history was investigated further: the patient stated that her father passed away from lung cancer at age 48, and her grandmother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 50 (Fig. 5). She then received chemotherapy with bevacizumab, paclitaxel for injection (albumin bound) and carboplatin for 2 cycles. At the beginning of the third cycle of paclitaxel, the patient showed allergic symptoms including facial flushing, urticaria and labored breathing, so we changed the protocol to bevacizumab, liposomal doxorubicin, and carboplatin for 6 cycles. She eventually received 8 cycles chemotherapy and received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab q 21 days for 16cycles as a meta-analysis showed there were significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients receiving chemotherapy combined with and without bevacizumab [8]. There is little research evidence on the use of bevacizumab in EC while a clinical trial suggested that IHC for p53 alone or when integrated with sequencing for TP53 mutations in EC for which bevacizumab is particularly beneficial in improving outcomes when combined with chemotherapy [9]. In light of the patient\u2019s history of two gynecological malignancies and her family history of cancer, we conducted nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) EC tissue. This screening detected 688 genes related to the occurrence, development, treatment, and prognosis of solid tumors, and the test results were analyzed in detail, the complete list of genes is available as Supplementary Table 1 and can be obtained from the authors. For molecular diagnosis, the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract genomic DNA (gDNA) from FFPE tissues, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Qubit (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to detect DNA concentration and quality. gDNA (250 ng) was used to construct the sequence library using the method described in previous literature [10]. The hybridization product was then purified, amplified, and quantified. Finally, 688 key cancerrelated genes were identified with paired-end 100- and 8-bp barcodes on a MGISEQ-2000 sequencer following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. 1 germline variant and 6 somatic variants were detected, only the TP53 c.844C > T, p.( R282 W) with NM_000546.5 was confirmed as a germline variation, the rest were verified as the somatic variations, Table 2 summarizes the somatic variant results. TP53 c.844C>T, p.( R282 W) with NM_000546.5 was found in a germline variant, a class 5 (C5) variant, inheritance of which is autosomal dominant. Her father and grandmother suffered from malignant tumor at a young age, it is very likely that her patrilineal family carried the TP53 gene mutation and passed it on to the patient, she got YST accompanied by subsequent EC that is associated with LFS, these two tumors rarely occur in a patient with LFS, this case represented a new finding that extends the clinical scope of LFS; since her father and grandmother had passed away, family verification could not be performed, we confirmed the mutation as a germline heterozygous variation (Fig. 6). The timeline of major events in the patient\u2019s treatment is shown in Table 3. Variants in Polymerase Epsilon (POLE) gene were not detected, as the same as microsatellite instability. Through this germline analysis, we suggested her mother and other patrilineal relatives received the germline testing, which would help the whole family discover or eliminate the risk of tumor in time. Sanger sequencing was performed on her mother in order to rule out carrying the TP53 variant during the follow-up, and the result was negative. It was further proved that her paternal family carried the TP53 variant. She is undergoing gynecological pelvic examinations, tumor markers and regular imaging for the progression of her disease. In addition, regular gastroenteroscopy, head and abdominal CT scans are also included during follow up to rule out other tumors. Discussion and conclusions Patients with LFS have a significant lifetime cancer risk [11\u201313]. Here, we report the first case of a YST accompanied by subsequent EC that is associated with LFS. In this case, genetic screening revealed a heterozygous pathogenic TP53 variant (p.R282 W). LFS patients are prone to ovarian and endometrial cancers [14] while these two tumors rarely occur in LFS patients at the same time. As such, this case represents a new finding that extends the clinical scope of LFS. The histopathology of the two tumors in this case was different, and there was no direct association between them. In comparison to other tumor syndromes, such as hereditary breast-ovarian cancer and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndromes, each tumor should be considered individually in people with TP53 germline variants. TP53 variants are often inherited, and family history is still the key criterion for considering LFS [15]. TP53 is the most mutated gene in tumors with some hot spots. In LFS, most TP53 variants are located in the highly-conserved regions of exons 5\u20138 of the DNAbinding domain, especially in exons 7 and 8 [16]. The specific TP53 variant in this patient is that a cytosine-tothymine transition leads to a missense arginine-to-tryptophan transition at amino acid 282 (p. R282W) within exon 8. The R282W germline variant has previously been observed in cohorts that tend to develop mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma of the gallbladder and breast cancer [17, 18]. The R282W variant has been regarded as a hotspot variant at both germline and somatic levels associated with poorer prognosis as compared to other pathogenic missense variants [19], this variant is included in the dbSNP database (rs28934574). The R282W mutant suppresses the expression of Kruppel-like-factor 17 (KLF17) which inhibits the promoters of epithelial mesenchymal transition-related genes, and thereby induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [20]. An in vitro study discovered that R282W mutant was associated with miR-155 expression which promote cellular transformation and invasion [21]. The R282W mutant is associated with an earlier onset of familial cancers and poorer outcomes of cancer patients. Pathological consequences of p53 variant include loss of normal p53 function, dominant-negative variants that can alter wild-type p53 function, and even a rare form of translocation defects with cytoplasmic accumulation and nuclear exclusion, particularly in certain regulatory domain variants [22]. In particular, when tumors show p53 expression by immunostaining, genetic testing for LFS should be performed, particularly in young patients. A research observed a high degree of concordance between TP53 variantal status and p53 protein expression by immunostaining [23]. p53 immunostaining should be performed on all malignant endometrial biopsies or curettings, and the immunophenotype of a carcinoma represented in a biopsy or curetting, tends to be concordant with the matched resection specimen [24]. A cohort study evaluating the need for germline testing in young patients with p53 expression in tumors is warranted. In addition, the current patient carried six types of somatic cancer variants, especially PTEN, frequently detected in EC and often appears in 80% of Cowden syndrome, has the most somatic copy number variations [25, 26]. PTEN is part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulation [27]. Loss of PTEN function in EC, via inactivating variant, deletion, or loss of protein expression, is associated with elevated levels of phosphorylated AKT [28]. The Cancer Genome Atlas database shows that the variation frequency of PTEN in EC was 66.42%. Loss or alteration of PTEN occurs in 45% of EC and is more commonly found in endometrioid EC than in other histological subtypes. A study showed that the TP53 variant frequency in serous endometrial carcinomas (> 90%) differentiated them from the endometrioid subtypes (11.4%) [29], another research suggested that the most common histologic subtype of TP53-mutated endometrial carcinomas is uterine serous carcinoma [23]. However, 50% endometrioid tumors with a non-silent TP53 variant also have non-silent variants in PTEN, compared to only 2.6% serous tumors with non-silent TP53 variants, although TP53 variants are not restricted to serous tumors, the coexisting PTEN variants in the endometrioid cases suggest a distinct tumorigenic mechanism [23], which is exactly what had happened in this case. Ovarian tumors reported in cases of LFS usually correspond to common epithelial tumors [30]. It had also been reported that epithelial and mesenchymal components of ovarian carcinosarcoma, ovarian neoplasms of the sex cord-stromal type were concordancly associated with TP53 germline variants [31]. However, there are few reports on YST associated with TP53 germline variants. This paper reports for the first time, a LFS patient with a rare ovarian germ cell tumor. The current understanding of YST at the molecular level is very limited, despite recent cancer genomic characterization efforts. The genomic landscape, evolutionary pattern, and chemoresistance- related mechanisms of this disease are largely unknown, due to lack of molecular evidence in this kind of tumor, further researches are needed with clinical trials and studies dedicated to better understanding the rare gynecological tumor molecular profile and pathogenesis. In the National Cancer Institute\u2019s LFS study, Phuong L. Mai reported the risk assessment of the first and subsequent cancers and the annual cumulative risk of the first and second cancer in TP53 variant carriers. The results showed that approximately 49% of people carrying with TP53 variants developed a subsequent cancer within 10 years of the first cancer. The average age-specific risk of developing a second cancer was comparable to the risk of developing a first cancer [32]. Hisada reported that patients with a germline TP53 variant had an increased risk of developing a second cancer; 30 years after the first cancer was diagnosed, the cumulative probability of developing the second cancer was 57% [33]. In this case, the interval between the two malignant tumors was only 4 years. This implies that LFS patients require regular follow-ups and physical examinations, regardless of how long they have been out of treatment. Clinical management of the patient may include monitoring other organs for tumor development [34]. Genetic counselling and predictive testing should be offered to patients fulfilling the classic LFS criteria as well as to their relatives, with intensified cancer screening if LFS is confirmed. This patient was very cooperative with our recommendation for genetic testing, and she understood that it is very important to her prognosis. As increasingly comprehensive genetic testing is provided to individuals who do not display a confirmed syndrome phenotype or family history, a wider range of aberrant expressions associated with germline variants of cancer-susceptibility genes may be realized. When pathology results show aberrant p53 patterns, as in this case, germline testing should be performed, particularly in young patients. This study represents the first reported case of a young, female patient with LFS who developed EC after a YST, highlighting the importance of screening and surveillance in hereditary cancer-susceptibility syndromes. This case highlights the importance of genetic testing for patients with malignant tumors, as well as patients with a family history of malignant tumors. Genetic screening not only provides enhanced cancer monitoring to improve the prognosis of patients, but also supports individualized and risk-based treatment decisions.

E-mail: viviane.gerger@kgu.de Dear Editors, Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis (PSO) are common inflammatory skin diseases. 1,2 The co-incidence of both diseases is rare, with prevalence in literature described to be around 1,5% in a population of patients with PSO and AD. 3 Previous theories have understood both diseases on a spectrum of T-cell immunity, with AD showing a dominant Th2 response and PSO a dominant Th1 activity. 4 Previously, it has been described that blocking IL 13/4 with Dupilumab may trigger the occurrence of psoriasis in patients who are predisposed for it. It was hypothesized that this phenomenon could be explained by a shift towards the increased activity of the Th1/Th17 pathway. 5 We present two patients with co-incident AD and PSO, the latter most likely triggered by treatment with Dupilumab undergoing dual treatment with Dupilumab and the selective IL-23 inhibitor Tildrakizumab. A 35-year-old Caucasian male with a 5-year history of moderate AD was treated with Dupilumab. The patient had no previous diagnosis of psoriasis. During treatment with Dupilumab, psoriasis was initially diagnosed. The psoriatic lesions initially did not require treatment. So, treatment with Dupilumab was resumed. As psoriasis worsened, Dupilumab was stopped. The PDE-4 inhibitor Apremilast was administered but was discontinued due to lack of effect on the AD. Cyclosporin A (CsA) had already been discontinued in the past due to adverse effects and Methotrexate (MTX) was not considered appropriate (elevated liver enzymes). Therefore in 2019, Dupilumab was restarted. As then psoriasis worsened, treatment with the IL-23 inhibitor Tildrakizumab was administered simultaneously to Dupilumab (initial Psoriasis Area and This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Topical treatment with calcipotriol/betamethasone was continued simultaneously. After 4 months of dual treatment, no significant adverse events occurred and both therapies were well tolerated. PASI was reduced from 11.9 to 7.2 within the first four months of treatment (Figure 1, Table 1). A 45-year-old Caucasian male with a 13-year history of AD was treated with Dupilumab. The patient had a history of psoriasis before treatment (inactive during initial presentation). During less than a year of treatment with an IL 4/13 Receptor (R) blockage, psoriasis re-appeared and Dupilumab was discontinued. Treatments with MTX and later Apremilast were administered but both needed to be discontinued due to adverse effects (dizziness, GI-symptoms) and inefficiency. After worsening of AD, Dupilumab was restarted, but simultaneous topical antipsoriatic therapy was insufficient. As psoriasis worsened (PASI: 9.1) and a new onset of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) was recorded, the IL17-R antagonist Brodalumab was administered and Dupilumab was stopped. The activity of psoriasis as well as arthritis were reduced, but the AD lacked control. Therefore, Dupilumab was restarted simultaneously to Brodalumab. Both diseases were controlled and no adverse events other than conjunctivitis were recorded. In order to reduce injection frequency, Tildrakizumab was introduced in 2020 (requiring 12-weekly injection intervals). Currently, both diseases and PsA are well-controlled with an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) of 9.4 and PASI of 3 (Figure 2, Table 1). Co-existing psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are rare and can co-occur due to administration of specific selective antibodies, which may trigger either psoriasis (AD specific 648 wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ddg JDDG: Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft. 2023;21:648\u2013650.

Established systemic immunosuppressive agents such as MTX or CsA show significant effects on both diseases.7,8 Nevertheless, side effects of these therapies can be limiting. Another safe and efficient option targeting both diseases is UV treatment. Its practicality is however often limited due to frequent travelling required to the provider and a high rate of reactivation after treatment stop.9 In literature, most cases of concomitant AD and PSO due to Dupilumab were either switched to established therapies or topical anti-psoriatic therapy was introduced.6 In this case, immunomodulatory treatments were either  16100387, 2023, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddg.15015, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

Co-existing AD and PSO treated with two biologics have already been reported.3 The introduction of two biologics was efficient and no adverse events other than conjunctivitis were observed. It can be critically discussed that patient 1 shows an incomplete response on psoriasis and patient 2 on AD. Further options targeting both diseases could be considered such as selective JAK inhibitors. Upadacitinib demonstrated superiority in direct comparison to Dupilumab in patients with AD and effects on skin lesions comparable to Adalimumab in patients with PsA.10,11 In summary, these cases show a safe and efficient option in the dual treatment of co-existing atopic dermatitis and psoriasis with two biologics in order to continue treatment with Dupilumab, despite it possibly triggering psoriasis.

Email: kuehn_j3@ukw.de Dear Editors, a 78-year-old white female patient presented to our department with burning and pruritic cutaneous lesions, which had occurred for the first time in 2013. At that time, erosive and slightly scaling plaques were found on the trunk while the mucosal membranes were not affected (Figure 1a). Otherwise, she was healthy. On histological examination, a slightly acanthotic epidermis with a mixed dermal inflammatory infiltrate was present. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy exhibited an intraepidermal intercellular deposition of IgG and C3. Further serological investigation revealed elevated IgG antibodies against desmoglein (Dsg)-1 (334 U/ml, positive \u2265 20 U/ml) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),whereas anti- Dsg-3 antibodies as well as antinuclear antibodies were negative. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus was made.1 The patient received immunosuppressive treatment with intravenous dexamethasone pulses (100 mg per day on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks) in combination with oral azathioprine (100 mg/d). Since liver enzymes increased upon azathioprine administration, the latter was replaced after 5 weeks by mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/d). Complete clinical remission was achieved after 4 months (anti-Dsg-1: 250 U/ml). Intermittent minor recurrences of pemphigus lesions during the further course were controlled by repetitive topical and systemic glucocorticoid treatment. Since 2017, however, the clinical morphology of the skin lesions changed fundamentally. The previous pathognomonic aspect of the skin with scaly erosive plaques, typical for pemphigus foliaceus, subsided. Instead, the patient developed annular, erythematous plaques, occasionally in a polycyclic arrangement and mainly located This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

The skin lesions were slightly elevated and infiltrated, with well-demarcated borders, little scaling, and small focal erosions at the edge of the lesions without obvious blister formation. The mucosa remained unaffected. The altered clinical presentation did not match our previous diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus. Therefore, further diagnostic work-up including repeated histological and immunologic examinations was conducted. Another skin biopsy obtained from the border of an annular lesion showed a dense dermal inflammatory infiltrate containing many eosinophils. No subcorneal or intraepidermal acantholysis could be detected but there was a prominent eosinophilic spongiosis (Figure 1c, d). Indirect and direct immunofluorescence microscopy studies revealed intraepidermal intercellular deposits of IgG and C3, analogous to previous findings (Figure 1e, f). ELISA testing for IgG antibodies against Dsg-1 in the patient\u2019s serum remained positive (282 U/ml) while anti-Dsg-3 as well as anti-desmocollins-1, -2, or -3 antibodies were negative. Based on the clinical appearance of the skin lesions, tinea corporis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, granuloma annulare and further blistering autoimmune diseases were considered as differential diagnoses but were excluded by histological, microbial, and serological examinations. Taken together, the combination of an altered clinical aspect of the skin lesions in conjunction with the histological findings and, importantly, the direct immunofluorescence results showing intercellular deposition of immunoglobulin G and C3 and the detection of serum autoantibodies against Dsg-1, led us to establish the diagnosis of pemphigus herpetiformis. Following the criteria proposed by Costa et al.,2, both clinical as well as pathologic and immunologic criteria were fulfilled in our case. Pemphigus herpetiformis was first described by Jablonska et al. in 1975,3, and several case reports have since been published.2,4 This rare pemphigus variant distinguishes itself from classical pemphigus foliaceus/vulgaris by a peculiar clinical presentation with significant pruritus and herpetiform blisters often resembling dermatitis herpetiformis and therefore eponymous for the disease. In addition, it differs histologically from classic pemphigus 16100387, 2023, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddg.15037, Wiley Online Library on [21/07/2023].

Dsg-1 is the most commonly detected autoantigen, but antibodies against Dsg-3 and desmocollins have also been observed.2,8 Pemphigus herpetiformis is a rare and \u2013 mainly due to its deviant and therefore misleading clinical presentation \u2013 often misdiagnosed autoimmune skin disease with a generally good prognosis. There is some debate about the definition of pemphigus herpetiformis and its distinction from pemphigus foliaceus/vulgaris. In our opinion, these entities might be regarded as a continuum that can evolve into both specific diseases. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize the particular clinical presentation and histological findings of pemphigus herpetiformis to (1) prevent misdiagnosis, and (2) to bear in mind further effective treatment options for this variant. As there is evidence in the literature of a good response to dapsone,2,4,9,10,we decided not to increase the immunosuppressive treatment but to initiate a systemic treatment with dapsone 50 mg per day in addition to the already administered mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/d). Upon this treatment, the clinical symptoms and particularly the pruritus improved significantly within two months. At the patient\u2019s last presentation in November 2022, complete clinical remission with absence of pruritus and declining anti-Dsg-1 levels were noted (Figure 2c). The exact pathogenetic mechanisms driving the transition from pemphigus foliaceus to pemphigus herpetiformis, as demonstrated in our case report, remain unclear.6 One may speculate that autoantibodies in pemphigus herpetiformis may recognize distinct epitopes and consecutively stimulate the release of proinflammatory mediators that promote recruitment of eosinophils (and neutrophils) and induction of spongiosis rather than inducing classical acantholysis as seen in pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus. Recognition of distinct epitopes due to chronic inflammation with subsequent tissue damage and autoimmune response to previously hidden antigens \u2013 known as epitope spreading \u2013 has also been proposed as the major mechanism for transition between pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus.11 Currently, there is no data available on the sequential evolution of the different phenotypes, that is, whethermore patients initially present with classical pemphigus vulgaris/foliaceus which later transforms into a pemphigus herpetiformis or vice versa. Nevertheless, our case report reminds us of the importance of rethinking and re-evaluating an already established diagnosis if the pattern of presentation changes during the clinical course.

Background. Lymphocytic myocarditis is a rare form of myocarditis, associated with a high mortality rate due to a high risk of sudden cardiac death. Lymphocytic myocarditis might present as a relevant extrapulmonary manifestation after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Case presentation. We report a case of a 26-year-old male with lymphocytic myocarditis, presenting with a 1-month history of increasing fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Eight weeks before, he was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He had received 2-dose schedule of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty\u00ae (BioNTech/ Pfizer) 6 months prior to his admission. Diagnostic work-up by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging demonstrated a severely reduced left ventricular function and a strong midmyocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Histology and immunohistology of the endomyocardial biopsies revealed an acute lymphocytic myocarditis. Immunosuppressive therapy with a steroid taper in combination with azathioprine 300 mg/day was initiated. The patient was equipped with a LifeVest\u00ae. On day 17, a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was documented. Follow-up CMR imaging after 3 months showed a slightly improved systolic left ventricular function, and a strong LGE was still detectable. Conclusions. The case highlights the significance of recognizing lymphocytic myocarditis correlated to COVID-19. It is important to be vigilant also of a later presentation of cardiomyopathy in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 due to high mortality without immediate support. 1. Background Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart muscle with myocyte degeneration and necrosis of non-ischemic origin, which is diagnosed by established histological [1] and immunohistological criteria [2]. The inflammation of the heart may be caused by different infectious agents, systemic diseases, drugs, and toxins, but viral infections are recognized as the most common [2]. 2. Case Presentation 2.1. Timeline. We report a 26-year-old, previously healthy male admitted to our emergency unit by his family doctor with a 1-month history of increasing fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath. The patient had prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 2 months before his admission. He had received a 2-dose schedule of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine Comirnaty\u00ae (BioNTech/Pfizer) latest 6 months ago. Two weeks prior to his admission, a pulmonary embolism could be ruled out by a thoracic computed tomography scan but was noticeable for a cardiomegaly, residual pulmonary infiltrates, and increased bihilar lymphatic tissue. Physical examination, besides an increased respiratory rate of 17/ minute and a heart rate of 123 bpm, revealed no pathologies, in particular no peripheral leg edema. The arterial blood pressure was 124/84mmHg. Blood analysis was noticeable for elevated cardiac markers with a Troponin I of 103 ng/l (ref: <34 ng/l), D-Dimer of 1.3 mg/l (ref: <0.5 mg/l), and an N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide of Hindawi Case Reports in Cardiology Volume 2023, Article ID 7646962, 7 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/7646962 2421 ng/l (ref: <125 ng/l). His blood count showed normal hemoglobin concentration, eosinophilic and platelet count, and no leukocytosis. A first nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was negative. Electrocardiogram showed an atrial tachycardia and a right bundle branch block (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a severely impaired biventricular systolic function. Pericardial effusion could be ruled out as well as a valvular heart disease (Figure 2). After excluding intraventricular thrombus formations, electric cardioversion could restore sinus rhythm, and antiarrhythmic medication with Amiodarone was initiated. Coronary artery disease could be excluded by a coronary angiography, and subsequent left ventricle (LV) endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) were performed. A guideline-directed heart failure therapy, including Dapagliflozin, Sacubitril/Valsartan, Eplerenone, and betablockade, was initiated. Further diagnostic work-up by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging on day 8 after admission confirmed a severely reduced LV systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction of 18%, hypokinesia inferoseptal and mediobasal, and a mild LV hypertrophy with an intraventricular septal thickness of 14mm. Stroke volume index was estimated with 25 ml/m2. CMR showed patchy subepicardial to transmural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) anteroseptal, inferior, and inferolateral. Global native T1 and T2 were elevated with a nT1 of 1326 ms and a T2 of 60ms (reference values: nT1 = 1256 (1240\u20131280) ms and nT2 = 45 (44\u201347) ms). LGE was evident also in the right ventricular wall. Additionally, enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes could be detected and a minimal left sided pericardial effusion (Figures 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d)). Histology and immunohistology of the EMB revealed an acute lymphocytic myocarditis with focal myocyte necrosis and infiltration of CD3+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages on day 13 (Figures 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for common cardiotropic viruses or bacteria was negative. Moreover, qRT-PCR analyses of the endomyocardial specimen for COVID-19 were negative. Thus, in absence of infectious agents in the myocardium, an immunosuppressive therapy was initiated on day 14 with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and continued for 2 weeks, followed by a dose tapering regimen of 10 mg every 4 weeks in combination with azathioprine 300mg/day. Due to a significant QTc interval prolongation, Amiodarone had to be terminated, and the patient was equipped with a Life- Vest\u00ae. On day 17, a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was documented (Figure 5). Heart failure therapy achieved remission of symptoms, and the patient could be discharged 18 days after admission. He was advised to refrain from high-intense physical activity. Followup CMR imaging, scheduled 3 months after hospital discharge, could demonstrate an improved LV systolic function with an estimated LV ejection fraction of 36% and a stroke volume index of 45 ml/m2. While native T1 and T2 normalized, strong LGE was still detectable. Combined immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone in a dose tapering regimen in combination with azathioprine 300mg/day was suggested to continue for 6 months. 3. Discussion and Conclusions In this work, we present a unique case of acute lymphocytic myocarditis in a young man post-COVID-19. An association between a SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocardial injury has been suggested since the outbreak of COVID-19 [3]. The frequency and prognostic impact of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis are unknown [4]. In 2020, SARS-CoV-2 virions were detected in myocytes of infected patients revealing myocarditis [5]. Until 2021, a total of 38 cases (26 male, 24 aged <50 years) of myocarditis in confirmed COVID-19 Table 1 Time Events Day 1 1-month history of increasing fatigue, palpitations, and shortness of breath 12-lead electrocardiogram showed an atrial tachycardia with 127 bpm. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a severely impaired biventricular systolic function with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 18%. After excluding intraventricular thrombus formations, electric cardioversion could restore sinus rhythm. Day 2 Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries. Left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy was performed. Day 2 Transfer to intermediate care unit and optimization of medical heart failure therapy. Day 8 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a severely reduced left ventricular function. Increased signaling of the interventricular myocardium and strong midmyocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was noticeable. LGE was evident also in the right ventricle. Day 13 Histology and immunohistology of the endomyocardial biopsies revealed an acute lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR revealed no infection with common cardiotropic viruses. Immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone was initiated (1 mg/kg/day) in combination with azathioprine 300 mg/day. Day 15 Patient was equipped with a LifeVest\u00ae. Day 17 Documentation of a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Day 20 Patient was discharged on a steroid taper in combination with azathioprine 300 mg/day. Follow-up at 3 months Follow-up cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed on an outpatient basis. An improved LV systolic function with an estimated LV ejection fraction of 36% was evident, and a strong LGE was still detectable. 2 Case Reports in Cardiology patients were reviewed [4]. In this report, five patients died in hospital, and the first case was a virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis, but myocarditis secondary to SARSCoV- 2 cardiotropism has also been demonstrated in EMB [4]. In an autopsy study of eight patients with severe COVID-19, active lymphocytic myocarditis was histologically found in all cases, although myocarditis was not clinically diagnosed [6]. In a clinical study from Wuhan by January 2020, myocardial damage was diagnosed in 12% among 41 admitted hospital patients (30 male) with confirmed COVID-19 [7]. Typical new onset of heart failure symptoms leading to admission in our patient in combination with elevated troponin level and severely reduced LV ejection fraction were suspicious for myocarditis in a young man [8, 9]. The definite diagnosis of lymphocytic myocarditis was established in EMB and underlines the recommended concept of EMB as gold standard in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis [10]. Lymphocytic myocarditis as presented here, however, could have a long list of potential causes, mainly virus-induced, by direct virus-mediated or indirect immune-mediated myocardial injury [11]. Persistence of the virus in EMB was associated with worse outcomes compared to viral clearance [12]. Of note, parvovirus B19 appears to cause both virus-mediated and virus-triggered myocarditis, whereas respiratory viruses, Figure 1: Electrocardiogram demonstrating atrial tachycardia with 127 beats per minute and a right bundle branch block configuration. Figure 2: Transthoracic echocardiography showing four chamber cardiac view. Case Reports in Cardiology 3 such as influenza and coronaviruses, can trigger an immunemediated lymphocytic myocarditis in the absence of viral genome in the myocardium [13, 14]. However, cause\u2013effect relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocarditis is difficult to demonstrate [4]. In our case, describing a young patient, recently going through COVID-19, we could not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR in EMB. This might, as discussed in a report of 18 patients with COVID- 19 and myocardial injury, be explained by transient viral infection or due to immunologic effects causing myocardial inflammation without direct viral infection of cardiomyocytes [4, 15]. It is not uncommon that the underlying organism in lymphocytic myocarditis is not detected as it is often cleared by the immune system before significant inflammation occurs [2, 16]. In viral myocarditis, follow-up analysis of EMBs by PCR documented spontaneous clearance of viral genomes in 36.2% [12]. Acute myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is reported by the European Medicine Agency safety committee as a rare adverse event [17]. Also, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, myocarditis/ pericarditis rates are described with 13 cases per million doses of second-dose mRNA vaccine [18]. In multiple studies/ case reports describing acute myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, however, this adverse event usually occurs shortly after the second dose [8, 19\u201321]. The patients presented with chest pain had elevated cardiac troponin levels, an abnormal ECG with ST elevations in most, and CMR imaging was suggestive of myocarditis in all and none of the patients had evidence of acute COVID-19 [21\u201323]. Typically, these patients are younger aged male and most required hospitalization up to 4 days but were considered mild [24]. Most cases recovered completely with or without heart failure treatment within 1 month [19, 21, (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 3: CMR imaging study showing severe LV dysfunction and signs of acute myocarditis. (a and c) Three-chamber views, (b and d) short axis views. (a and b) LGE images with severe subepicardial to transmural LGE inferolateral and anterolateral. (c and d) Native T1- maps with focal increased native T1 values in LGE positive regions. 4 Case Reports in Cardiology 24\u201326]. Most recently it was shown that, especially in young men, IL-1RA antibodies are relevant in the pathogenesis of myocarditis after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination [27]. Despite rare cases of myocarditis, the benefit\u2013risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination showed a favorable balance for all age and sex groups [21]. As clinical condition was sufficiently stable in our patient, heart failure medication was initiated immediately [28]. The beneficial effect of immunosuppressive therapy in biopsy-proven virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis could be demonstrated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Tailored IMmunosuppression in virusnegative Inflammatory Cardiomyopathy (TIMIC) trial including 85 patients [29]. In this trial, the patients received prednisone and azathioprine (n = 43) vs. placebo (n = 42) for 6 months [29]. The benefit from immunosuppressive therapy could recently be demonstrated also after long-term follow-up (up to 20 years) [30]. The risk of cardiovascular death and heart transplantation was significantly lower in treated patients included in the TIMIC trial, and patients showed persistent improvement in the LV ejection fraction compared with the placebo group [30]. Long-term benefit of combined immunosuppressive therapy, including steroids and azathioprine, could also be shown in dilated cardiomyopathy [31]. Early and late favorable effects of immunosuppressive therapy could particularly been shown for improvement of LV function, although improvement was also shown in the placebo group, but less often [31]. In our patient, however, we thought improvement of LV function was most probably related to immunosuppressive therapy. Until now, limited data support the use of immunosuppressive agents in COVID-19-associated cardiac involvement [32]. In acute myocarditis, as in our case, polymorphic and irregular ventricular arrhythmias are particularly common and present a relevant risk [33]. As a consequence, a Life- Vest\u00ae, as wearable cardioverter defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden cardiac, was implanted due to the high risk of sudden cardiac death in our patient. While the patient has improved LV ejection fraction >35%, was asymptomatic with remission of symptoms, NYHA I, and had no history of cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia, no permanent cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. He had clearly a lowered risk due to heart failure therapy, and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend an cardioverter defibrillator in either secondary prevention or symptomatic patients (NYHA II\u2013III) with an LV ejection fraction \u226435% [33]. Physical activity should be restricted during the acute phase of myocarditis until the disease has completely resolved as recommended in our case [34]. 4.

Wilke1 , Daniel Biermann3, Maria Grafmann1, Rainer Kozlik\u2011Feldmann1, Dzhoy Papingi2, J\u00f6rg S. Sachweh3, Fridrike Stute1 and Jakob Olfe1* Abstract Primary cardiac tumors in children are very rare and may be associated with severe arrhythmias and sudden infant death syndrome. These cardiac arrhythmias vary depending on the location and size of the tumor. Sixty-four percent of children with cardiac fibroma, the second most common benign cardiac tumor in children, have ventricular arrhythmias, affecting therapeutic management and risk profile of these children. We report on two siblings with cardiac fibromas whose clinical presentations differed depending on their locations and size of the tumors. The first child, a three-year-old girl, was diagnosed with a cardiac fibroma in the left ventricle at the age of 8 months after surviving resuscitation due to ventricular fibrillation. Secondary prophylactic implantation of an ICD was performed. On propranolol, no further malignant arrhythmias have occurred to date. The seven-month-old brother was diagnosed postnatally with a cardiac tumor adjacent to the right ventricle. A few weeks after birth, the boy had refractory supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmia that only resolved with amiodarone. In genetic testing, Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome was diagnosed in both children. Conservative pharmacological therapy is a therapeutic strategy for asymptomatic patients with cardiac fibromas. The anti-arrhythmic medication depends on the location of the tumor. Implantation of an ICD should be performed in cases of malignant arrhythmias. In rare cases, there is an association between cardiac tumors and genetic syndromes, such as Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome. These should always be considered when such a tumor is diagnosed. Keywords Cardiac arrhythmias, Cardiac fibroma, Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome Background Primary cardiac tumors occur very rarely in children with a prevalence between 0.0017 and 0.28%. Ninety percent of the tumors are benign. The most common is rhabdomyoma (60%), followed by fibroma (10\u201325%), myxoma (6\u201315%) and teratoma (2\u20139%). Primary malignant cardiac tumors in childhood are mainly rhabdomyosarcomas and fibromyosarcomas. They occur less frequently than secondary (metastatic) malignant tumors [1]. Clinical symptoms are highly variable depending on the location and size of the tumors. The children may be asymptomatic or present with heart murmurs due to obstruction of the inflow and outflow tracts and ventricular lumen, cyanosis, dyspnea, heart failure, emboli, and arrhythmias. The latter range from single premature beats to ventricular arrhythmias with sudden cardiac death [1]. Larger fibromas are associated with a 50% risk of ventricular tachycardia [2]. Cardiac tumors are usually diagnosed pre- and postnatally by echocardiography. To determine the subtype of the tumor, cardiac MRI or CT is the method of choice. In rare cases, biopsy is indicated if the findings are ambiguous [1]. Depending on the location and size of the tumor and clinical symptoms, antiarrhythmic medication or surgical resection of the tumor should be considered. Inoperable findings may require implantation of an implantable cardioverter- defibrillator or cardiac transplantation [1]. Cardiac fibromas are mostly singular and invasive tumors with a size of 1\u20139 cm and located intramurally, primarily in the septum and left ventricular apex. Pathognomonic for fibromas are central calcifications and cystic degenerations in the tumor as a consequence of insufficient vascular perfusion [1, 3]. Unlike rhabdomyomas, spontaneous regression of cardiac fibromas is not observed [4]. In rare cases, cardiac tumors are associated with congenital heart defects and genetic syndromes. Rhabdomyomas are seen in 70\u201390% of cases with tuberous sclerosis. Cardiac fibromas are associated with Beckwith\u2013Wiedemann syndrome and Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome [1]. Gorlin\u2013 Goltz syndrome is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder often associated with a variant in the protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) gene on chromosome 9q22. It is associated with the occurrence of basal cell carcinomas, jaw cysts, skeletal abnormalities, calcifications of the falx cerebri, and facial dysmorphia [5]. The occurrence of cardiac fibroma in Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome has been described rarely with a frequency of 3\u20135% [6]. We report on two siblings with cardiac tumors. They developed different, severe cardiac arrhythmias depending on tumor location and size. The first child, a threeyear- old girl, was diagnosed with cardiac fibroma in the left ventricle at the age of eight months after surviving resuscitation with observed ventricular fibrillation. Her seven-month-old brother was found to have a cardiac tumor adjacent to the right ventricle after birth. Within the first few months of life, he developed severe, therapyrefractory supraventricular tachycardia and premature beats. In human genetic testing, Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome was diagnosed based on a missense mutation in the PTCH1 gene. Our case shows that, depending on the location and size of the cardiac tumor, different cardiac arrhythmias may occur which influence the child\u2019s risk profile and accordingly their therapeutic management. Case report First child The three-year-old girl was born prematurely at 35 + 4 weeks of gestation without complications. At the age of seven months, she became unconscious while playing. She was resuscitated with observed ventricular fibrillation for 30 min in an external clinic. A single defibrillation followed by intubation and a single intratracheal adrenaline dose was performed, whereupon circulation was restored. The lactate level reached a maximum value of 20 mmol/l and the pH value in the venous blood was initially 6.9. After resuscitation, the patient showed sinus rhythm without further need for catecholamines. The patient was transferred to our clinic with stable circulation. The cardiac markers N-terminal fragment brain natriuretic peptides (six days later: 10,780 ng/l) and troponin T (six days later: 640 pg/ml) were significantly elevated for several days. Subsequent echocardiography demonstrated an apexnear intramural tumor (43 mm \u00d7 30 mm \u00d7 27 mm) in the posterior and lateral wall of the left ventricle. Ventricular function and contractility were not impaired. There was no obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Diastolic function was moderately reduced. Firstdegree mitral valve insufficiency due to infiltration of the tumor into the papillary muscle was shown. The coronary arteries were not displaced (See Fig. 1). The cardiac tumor had not been detected prenatally during routine examinations. In cardiac MRI, the mass was hyperintense in the T2-weighted sequence and iso- to hypointense in the native T1w-weighted sequence. It showed minimal late gadolinium enhancement. Calcifications in the tumor were not detected. Visually, the right ventricular function was slightly impaired (See Fig. 2). The twelve-lead electrocardiography showed negative T-waves in the posterior wall and left precordial leads as a sign of cardiac conduction delay within the tumor mass or unusual repolarization in this area (See Additional files 1). No abnormalities in terms of cardiac arrhythmias, pauses or premature beats were documented in the Holter monitor. In view of the location and size of the tumor and normal cardiac function without obstruction of the outflow tract, total or partial surgical resection was not performed. As secondary prevention, a VVI-ICD (Medtronic, model Evera MRI VR SureScan) was implanted by using the \u201cHsia method\u201d [7]. The lead was placed retrocardial in the transverse pericardial sinus and the ICD generator in the left rectus sheath (See Additional files 2). In addition, the girl takes daily weight-adjusted antiarrhythmic medication at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight propranolol. During implantation of the ICD, three biopsies of the tumor were taken, which confirmed the suspected diagnosis of cardiac fibroma. The histology showed cell-rich spindle cell proliferates with isolated calcifications and few blood vessels. There was no cell atypia as an expression of malignancy. In immunohistochemistry, the tumor was positive for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and CD34-antigen. The marker Ki-67 for cell proliferation was not significantly detectable (See Additional files 3). At the age of 13 months, the girl became unconscious as a result of a hypoglycemic episode (blood glucose 32 mg/dl) during a first attempt at weaning with no nighttime feeding. This event was most likely due to a side effect of the beta-blocker. Eight months after implantation of the ICD, lead dysfunction of the shock electrode occurred due to a broken cable. The lead was surgically replaced. In regular echocardiographic examinations, no size progression of the tumor has been detected to date. Regular readings of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator did not reveal any cardiac arrhythmias leading to delivery of a shock. Otherwise, the girl has developed normally as expected for her age. Second child The seven-month-old brother was born at 38 + 2 weeks of gestation (APAGAR: 9/9/9). Postnatally, an echocardiographic examination was performed in view of the family history. This revealed a mediastinal mass lateral to the right ventricle (2 \u00d7 2.5 cm), which had not been visualized prenatally. Apart from the age-related open foramen ovale, there was no obstruction of the right ventricle or limitation of cardiac function (See Fig. 3). The mediastinal mass was also detected on cardiac MRI. This presented isointense in the T1-weighted sequence and hyperintense in the T2-weighted sequence and showed late gadolinium enhancement, consistent with the characteristics of a cardiac fibroma (See Fig. 4). In the 24-h electrocardiography, no malignant arrhythmias were detected except for isolated premature beats (< 1% of all beats) (See Additional files 4). The cardiac biomarkers N-terminal fragment brain natriuretic peptides (1896 ng/l) and troponin I (91 pg/ml) were slightly elevated after birth. Fig. 1 echocardiogram girl.

Legend: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showing an intracardiac iso- to hypointense mass in the left ventricle in the native T1w-weighted sequenceTwenty days after birth, the infant was readmitted as an emergency due to a reduction in oxygen saturation (74%) and supraventricular tachycardia (Heart rate: 300/min). Initially, he presented with decreased systemic perfusion with pale skin coloration and prolonged capillary refill time without circulatory instability. No conversion was achieved with multiple doses of adenosine. A subsequent single dose of metoprolol initially resulted in a reduction in heart rate (Heart rate: 150\u2013180/min). Final rate control after further tachycardic episodes was achieved with continuous intravenous therapy with esmolol. Under subsequent continuous antiarrhythmic therapy with a combination of metoprolol and flecainide, the boy had a strong tendency towards arterial hypotension. In addition, there was an increase in episodes of ventricular arrhythmia and an increasing number of ventricular extrasystoles. These varied between ventricular bigeminy and triplets and supraventricular extrasystoles. Accordingly, the medication was discontinued again and switched to amiodarone. Since then, after a saturation phase with 15 mg/kg body weight, he has received permanent medication with a daily dose of 5 mg/kg body weight amiodarone. Under this therapy, a successful and persistent rhythm control without extrasystoles and cardiac arrhythmias has been achieved so far. In view of the location and size of the tumor and the normal cardiac function without obstruction of the outflow tract, neither total nor partial surgical resection has been performed. The children\u2019s heart rate and oxygen saturation are monitored at night with a home monitoring system. During daily life, the heart rate of the girl is measured by a smartwatch. The data is transmitted to the parents\u2019 smartphone. In addition, the family has an automated external defibrillator at home. The mother had a sinus thrombosis two years before the birth of the first child with subsequent unremarkable thrombophilia screening. The father had multiple maxillary cysts and plantar pits in adolescence. There is no known case of Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome in either family. Clinically and historically, there are no other manifestations of the syndrome at the present time, either in the father nor in the children. Because of this historical evidence and the children\u2019s cardiac tumors, the children were tested for Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome. In human genetic testing, Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome was diagnosed based on a missense mutation in the PTCH1 gene. Discussion Different, severe arrhythmias in cardiac fibromas The case of the siblings demonstrates the occurrence of arrhythmias in children with cardiac fibromas and that these may vary depending on the location of the tumors. Cardiac fibroma is most frequently located in the left ventricle (57.3%), followed by the right ventricle (27.5%) and the interventricular septum (17%). The latter location is associated with increased mortality (58.6%) compared with the other two [8]. Clinically remarkable arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia, occurs in 64% of cases. Cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation occurs in 10% of cases. More benign arrhythmias, such as extrasystoles or supraventricular tachycardia, have been described in 4% of cases [2]. Other symptoms may include dyspnea, cyanosis, heart murmurs, cardiomegaly, and heart failure [1]. Such symptoms were not known to have occurred in the girl before the resuscitation event. Carreon et al. describe re-entry circuits as a cause of ventricular arrhythmias in cardiac fibromas. The substrate of these circuits are interdigitated segments of normal myocardial tissue and pathological tumor tissue, resulting in a delay in cardiac conduction and thus in ventricular arrhythmias. The architecture is similar to the peri-infarct zone after myocardial infarction [9]. In addition, histopathological remodeling processes cause structural changes in the cardiac fibroma with increasing age of the patient. While the degenerate myocardium is the predominant component within the tumor until three years of age, the fibrous component increases more strongly thereafter. A high proportion of degenerated myocardium is associated with a higher risk of cardiac arrest. Therefore, this is a possible reason why children under three years of age with a cardiac fibroma are most likely to suffer a cardiac arrest [9]. The girl was found to have a benign tumor in the apex of the left ventricle after surviving resuscitation. The tumor of the brother overlies the right ventricle from mediastinal and resulted in severe polymorphic supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular premature beats. Dominguez et al. describe a case of sudden infant death syndrome in an eight-month-old boy who became cyanotic and unconscious shortly after feeding. A subsequent forensic examination revealed a cardiac fibroma in the left ventricle [10]. These cases highlight that the earliest possible diagnosis of cardiac fibroma is essential to prevent ventricular tachycardia or sudden infant death syndrome due to cardiac tumor. Cardiac fibromas are associated with severe arrhythmias, which may vary depending on the location and size of the tumor. Re-entry circuits in the area of the tumor are a possible cause, leading to a disturbance of cardiac conduction. In children with recently developed arrhythmias without a known cause, a cardiac tumor should always be considered. Drug therapy with optional ICD implantation in asymptomatic patients Cardiac fibromas can cause conduction disturbance producing the substrate for life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition, hemodynamically relevant obstruction of the inflow and outflow tract of the heart or obstruction of the coronary arteries may occur. In these cases, depending on the location and size of the tumor and cardiac function, subtotal or total resection of the tumor is indicated. For larger tumors, subtotal resection is preferred over total resection because of the lower risk for intraoperative arrhythmias. Alternatively, heart transplantation can be performed in the case of inoperable findings [1]. Several studies report successful surgery with a very low risk for later ventricular arrhythmias and recurrence of tumor growth [11, 12]. In asymptomatic patients with a cardiac fibroma, the studies are ambiguous regarding therapy. Some authors recommend resection of the tumor because of the risk of ventricular arrhythmia with sudden cardiac death [13]. A few other authors describe drug therapy for asymptomatic patients with antiarrhythmic drugs and, if necessary, ICD implantation as primary or secondary prophylaxis, as an alternative to surgical resection, especially in infants and young children (See Table 1). Complications of ICD in children include lead dysfunction and dislocation, fracture of the shock coil, inducing an inappropriate shock and device infection [14]. \u00dcnsal and Ekici report the case of a nine-year-old boy who was diagnosed with cardiac fibroma in the wall of the left ventricle in infancy. The tumor was not removed. No tumor growth was detected in regular follow-ups and the boy was otherwise cardiac asymptomatic [16]. Horovitz et al. describe the case of a girl who presented with a systolic murmur at six months of age. After a fibroma in the right ventricle was diagnosed, conservative therapy with amiodarone was initially given. At three years of age, the tumor was surgically removed due to increase in size [11]. In several cases, amiodarone is used to control ventricular arrhythmias. The class III antiarrhythmic drug has a lower rate of side effects in children than in adults. This is due to the more rapid metabolism of amiodarone in children [19]. While side effects occur in 4% of children under ten years of age, those over ten years of age are affected in up to 44% [20]. Side effects include keratopathies, thyroid dysfunction, neurotoxicity, skin changes such as discoloration or photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances, hepatitis, and pulmonary toxicity. In addition, amiodarone may cause worsening of arrhythmia, hypotension, or bradycardic arrhythmia with prolongation of QTc-time. The side effects develop primarily in long-term use in children, whereas short-term use is relatively safe [21]. With combination of flecainide and metoprolol the boy did not suffer any recurrence of supraventricular tachycardia, but nevertheless developed an increasingly higher burden of premature ventricular beats and more importantly up to triplets in the 24-h-holter-electrocardiography. A change of therapy to amiodarone led to stabilization of the arrhythmias. No side effects occurred during the saturation phase of amiodarone and up to the present time. Since the resuscitation event, the sister has been receiving a daily dose of propranolol. In addition, an ICD was implanted for secondary prevention because of the ventricular fibrillation that had occurred. Except for the hypoglycemic episode and the broken cable of the shock electrode of the defibrillator eight months after implantation, no further complications have occurred to date. Regular follow-up examinations with readings of the ICD revealed no triggering of shocks and or impairment of cardiac function. The cardiac fibroma has not grown so far. There is no obstruction of the inflow and outflow tract. No further cardiac arrhythmias occurred under a daily medical therapy. The girl is otherwise age-appropriately developed and attends kindergarten. The cases shows that the cardiac arrhythmias can be controlled with individually adjusted drug therapy allows a largely normal life for asymptomatic children with cardiac fibromas. Regular follow-up examinations of the tumor and cardiac function by echocardiography and reading of the ICD are essential. Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome and cardiac fibromas In rare cases, cardiac fibromas are associated with Gorlin\u2013 Goltz syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disease with a variant in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1. The loss-of-function mutation leads to dysfunction of the Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway in the affected allele on chromosome 9, resulting in excessive activation of a transmembrane protein that influences embryonic development of skin and teeth, tumorigenesis, and organogenesis [22, 23]. More rarely, a variant of the suppressor of fused (SUFU) gene is known. Affected individuals with this variant have a significantly higher risk of medulloblastoma in early childhood of 33% compared to affected individuals with the PTCH1 variant with a risk less than 2% [24]. The syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a very rare disease with a prevalence of 1:150 000 [25]. An affected parent is present in 70\u201380% of affected individuals. The other 20\u201330% have a de novo variant. Affected individuals with the PTCH1 variant show complete penetrance. Penetrance of the SUFU variant is not clearly understood, but reduced penetrance is assumed [24]. The disease is associated with the frequent occurrence of basal cell carcinomas and jaw cysts in 90% of cases before the age of 40 [26]. The most common cutaneous, skeletal, and neurologic changes and associated tumor disease are used as major and minor criteria for clinical diagnosis (See Table 2) [24]. The presence of two major criteria and one minor criterion or one major criterion and three minor criteria ensure the diagnosis of Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome. In addition to multiple basal cell carcinomas, there is a predisposition to medulloblastomas, meningiomas, cardiac and ovarian fibromas, rhabdomyomas, and lymphomas [24]. Human genetic testing includes sequence analysis of the PTCH1 and SUFU genes, deletion and duplication analysis for both genes, and ribonucleic acid analysis of PTCH1 [24]. If the diagnosis is confirmed, multidisciplinary care is required. This includes regular dermatologic, neurologic, and dental screenings and radiographs to detect skeletal changes. Regular MRI examinations should be performed up to the age of seven for early detection of medulloblastoma. Ultrasound examinations are necessary for the detection of ovarian or cardiac fibromas [22]. The therapy depends individually on the clinical manifestation of the syndrome. Jaw cysts and basal cell carcinomas are usually surgically removed. For basal cell carcinomas, cryotherapy, laser or phototherapy are alternative options depending on the number and size of the tumors. Life expectancy of patients with Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome is not significantly reduced [24]. Three to five percent of affected individuals have a cardiac fibroma [6]. A few cases of intracardiac tumors associated with Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome have been described in the literature. Ritter et al. report the case of a girl who was found to have a cardiac fibroma in the left ventricle after a first episode of ventricular tachycardia when she Table 2 Major and minor criteria for the diagnosis of GGS [24] Major criteria Minor criteria Lamellar calcification of the falx < age 20 years Childhood medulloblastoma Jaw keratocyst Lympho-mesenteric or pleural cysts Palmar/plantar pits (\u2265 2) Macrocephaly (Occipitofrontal Circumference > 97th centile) Basal cell carcinomas (> 5 in a lifetime or 1 basal cell carcinoma before age of 30) Cleft lip/palate First-degree relative with NBCCS Vertebral/rib anomalies Preaxial or postaxial polydactyly Ovarian/cardiac fibromas Ocular anomalies (e.g., cataract) was six years old. In addition, she had jaw cysts several times during her childhood and other typical symptoms of Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome. At the age of 13 years a variant in the PTCH1 gene was detected. Her father had a known history of jaw cysts [18]. In our case both siblings have a cardiac tumor. In addition, the father has a history of jaw cysts and plantar pits. For this reason, the girl was tested for Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome. In human genetic testing, Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome was diagnosed. A variant in the PTCH1 gene was detected. This case intends to sensitize pediatricians for the diagnosis of a cardiac tumor presenting with different cardiac arrhythmias in association with Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome. Automated external defibrillators in resuscitation of infants and young children A Swedish study reported an incidence for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for children aged zero to 21 years of 4.9 per 100 000 person-years. The survival rate for this group has increased over the past two decades, but is relatively low at 9.3% across all age groups between zero and 21 years. Children under one year of age have the lowest survival rate with 5.1% [27]. The reason for resuscitation in children is more often a respiratory event or shock than a primary cardiac event [28]. In non-professional resuscitation of infants and young children, an automated external defibrillator with pediatric shocks should be used, if available. If such an automated external defibrillator is not available in an emergency, children of all ages should be defibrillated with a standard adult automated external defibrillator [29]. Defibrillators with biphasic shocks are preferred over those with monophasic shocks in children because of the lower defibrillation energy required for terminating ventricular fibrillation or pulseless tachycardia. The recommended dose of a shock in infants and young children is 2\u20134 J/kg body weight. For an adult automated external defibrillator, the defibrillation energy ranges from 120 to 360 J per shock, which is much higher than the recommended energy for infants and young children [28]. Cardiac tumors are a potential trigger for ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, the family has an automated external defibrillator with pediatric mode. The parents are familiar with pediatric resuscitation. No cardiac emergency requiring defibrillation with the automated external defibrillator has occurred yet. Bar-Cohen et al. report the first known case of successful resuscitation of a child using a pediatric automated external defibrillator. A four-month-old girl with known Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome was resuscitated by her parents. The automated external defibrillator induced a biphasic shock of 50 J under ventricular fibrillation. After conversion to asystole and severe bradycardia, normal rhythm was restored within 60 s [30]. European and U.S. guidelines for resuscitation of infants and children up to eight years of age recommend defibrillation with a pediatric automated external defibrillator when manual defibrillation by trained personnel is not available in an emergency [28, 29]. Use of an automated external defibrillator without pediatric attenuators is acceptable (Class IIb recommendation) according to the U.S. guidelines. The benefit is greater than the risk, but the effectiveness is unclear. The recommendation is not based on any scientific studies, but is based on clinical experience of experts [28]. Randomized-controlled trials comparing the benefits of pediatric and adult automated external defibrillators in resuscitation of infants and children up to eight years of age in terms of outcome and neurologic and cardiac consequences for the children are needed to provide evidence- based recommendations for pediatric emergency care in the future. Conclusions The siblings\u2019 case report shows that cardiac tumors can be associated with severe arrhythmias. These can vary depending on the location and size of the tumor. In this context, early diagnosis of tumors is essential to prevent serious cardiac events and to initiate preventive therapy. The benefit of surgical removal of the tumor or longterm conservative therapy depends individually on the location and size of the tumor and impairment of cardiac function. In our case, the girl is well controlled by medication with propranolol and secondary prophylactic ICD implantation. The boy has no ventricular arrhythmias on a daily dose of amiodarone and is cardiac stable. In human genetic testing, Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome was diagnosed. When cardiac fibroma is diagnosed, an association with genetic syndromes, such as Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome, should always be considered. Gorlin\u2013Goltz syndrome is a rare disease, but affects patients\u2019 risk profile and treatment management. Children with cardiac tumors have a higher risk of requiring resuscitation due to malignant arrhythmias. In this case, defibrillation with an automated external defibrillator can be a life-saving measure. However, guidelines for the use of automated external defibrillators in resuscitation of infants and young children are not evidence-based and randomized-controlled trials are necessary.

Tel.: +39 3335702842 Email: beatricesimeone@alice.it Case Presentation We report the characteristic case of an 83-year-old Caucasian female, followed for several years, every six months, at our clinic dedicated to heart failure. Her comorbidities include: systemic arterial hypertension; obesity; gonarthrosis with occasional use of NSAIDs; gastric intolerance to ASA (upper digestive endoscopy with signs of gastritis in September 2011). In her medical history she presented an electrocardiogram with a left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) known for many years. The first Echocardiogram performed in 2012 showed: dilated left atrium. Dilated left ventricle; normal wall thicknesses; paradoxical interventricular septum movement (due to LBBB), reduced ejection fraction (EF): 35%. A trans-mitral pattern compatible with Impaired LV relaxation (E/E \u2019= 13). Nomal right\u2019s ventricular function (TAPSE = 20 mm). Normal estimated PAPs. Since then the woman had always led an active life, until, in March 2015, she was admitted to Cardiology for Abstract Transthyretin (TTR)-related cardiac amyloidosis is a progressive infiltrative cardiomyopathy that mimics hypertensive, hypertrophic heart disease and may go undiagnosed. We here report the case of a 83-year-old woman, which has rapresented an unique case of transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis, as a patient with an initial diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease later develops an infiltrative cardiomyopathy due to amyloid deposits. Clin Ter 2023; 174 (3):235- 239 doi: 10.7417/CT.2023.2526 Key words: cardiac amyloidosis, ATTR, infiltrative cardiomyopathy, heart failure, longitudinal strain, transthyretin Acute Pulmonary Edema associated with non-elevated blood pressure (140/70 mmHg), promptly treated with vasodilators and diuretics e.v. BNP at discharge was 227 pg / mL. The pre-discharge echocardiogram showed: a dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle with hypertrophy of the mid-basal interventricular septum and reduced EF of 35%, an evident intraventricular dyssyncrony dued to LBBB, and grade I diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 1). We also performed the longitudinal strain bull\u2019s eye plot derived from 2-dimensional speckle tracking imaging of left ventricle, that showed a reduced values of longitudinal strain of all wall segments, only sligthly better in the apex. On this occasion, in order to exclude an ischemic etiology of cardiomyopathy, a coronary angiography was performed and revealed a diffuse coronary atheromasia, in the absence of significant lesions. Therefore, following these diagnostic findings, her cardiomyopathy was classified as \u201chypertensive\u201d. Due to the non-recovery of systolic function and persistent LBBB, in January 2016 the patient was subjected to CRT-D implantation, with consequent partial recovery of left ventricular systolic function already one month after implantation (FEVS 45%). Subsequently, the patient had a period of relative clinical well-being. The situation seems to be falling again in May 2019, when the patient is again admitted for acute pulmonary edema, this time on a hypertensive basis. The echocardiogram performed during the hospitalization (Fig. 2) revealed a size of left ventricle at the limits for BSA, with an increase in the thickness of the left ventricle wall, in particular at the level of the interventricular septum (SIV), which appeared frankly hypertrophic (greater than > 15 mm at the level the mid-posterior wall); with a \u201cgranular sparkling\u201d appearance of the myocardium; there was also a slight reduction in global systolic function (EF calculated with the Simpson Biplano method 45%, stable respect to the previous controls); Left atrial enlargement (LAVI 54 mL / m2); Diastolic filling pattern of grade II diastolic dysfunction (E/E\u2019: 23). Thus, during this hospitalization we repeated longitudinal strain bull\u2019s eye plot. Surprisingly, it showed a relatively preserved longitudinal systolic function at the LV apex, in contrast with reduced longitudinal shortening at basal level. It was evident a progressive impairment of longitudinal shortening from the apex to the basal left ventricular segments. This pattern is known as relative \u201capical sparing\u201d pattern (Fig. 3). Fig. 1. Echocardiographic clip in four chambers apical view performed in 2015 before the CRTD implantation which demonstrated a dilated and hypokinetic left ventricle with hypertrophy of the mid-basal interventricular septum and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%, an evident intraventricular dyssyncrony dued to LBBB, and grade I diastolic dysfunction. Fig. 2. Echocardiographic clip in four chambers apical view performed in 2019 during an hospitalization for flash pulmonary edema: marked parietal hypertrophy of LV (wall thickness \u2267 15 mm at the interventricular septum) with a \u201cbrilliant\u201d speckled appearance of the myocardium and mild reduction of LVEF (45%); Pseudonormal diastolic dysfunction (E/E\u2019 23). At this point in the suspicion of a picture compatible with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, we interviewed the patient again to deepen her medical history and she told us that she had been operated twice on a bilateral carpal tunnel in 2004 and 2016. The same longitudinal strain bull\u2019s eye plot performed in 2019 showed a relatively preserved longitudinal systolic function at the LV apex in contrast with reduced longitudinal shortening at basal level . There is progressive impairment of longitudinal shortening from the apex (central area, red color) to the basal left ventricular segments (external areas, pink color). This pattern is known as relative \u201capical sparing\u201d pattern. Diagnosis Since CRT-D was not RMN-compatible, total body bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-Oxidronate osteotrope (99mTc- HDP) was performed in the hypothesis of amyloidotic cardiomyopathy which showed extra bone accumulation of the tracer at the left ventricle (Fig. 4). The extent of the uptake was slightly greater than on the coasts (grade 2-3 of the Perugini scale). This picture would be compatible with infiltration of the myocardium by amyloid deposits formed by the plasma protein Transtiretin (ATTR). Furthermore, an electromyography allowed us to exclude a small fiber neuropathy (NPF). Once the diagnosis of TTR-related amyloidosis is established, it is essential to distinguish between the senile form and the familial form by genetic analysis, to search for possible pathogenic mutations in the TTR gene (1, 2). In our case the genetic analysis by sequencing the entire coding region of the TTR gene has excluded the presence of pathogenic mutations, thus allowing us to identify the wild-type TTR form. Finally, the medical treatment of heart failure has been potentiated with titration of ACE-I and beta blocker, with the hypothesis of introducing a targeted therapy in the short term like tafamidis, a small molecule stabilizing the tetramer of TTR wild-type. The patient showed however, an excellent therapeutic response, maintaining a good haemodynamic compensation to date. Discussion Amyloidosis represents a group of acquired or inherited disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins with consequent alteration of the architecture and function of the involved tissues (3,4). The heart is one of the main target organs. Cardiac involvement may be due to two distinct etiological forms (5,6): AL amyloidosis, a non-hereditary systemic form, secondary to the presence of medullary plasma cell clones that produce free circulating light chains of immunoglobulins responsible for fibrillar deposits, and transthyretin amyloidosis (TTR, previously called prealbumin) a protein produced by the liver that carries retinol and thyroid hormones in the blood. It has a tendency to dissociate into dimers and monomers and subsequently aggregate into insoluble fibrils (7). Fig. 4. Sections of the Scintigraphy with 99mTc-HDP (99mTc-hydroxyethylene-diphosphonate) bone tracer of the patient affected by ATTRwt, which shows a left ventricular uptake slightly higher than the bone uptake, corresponding to Perugini\u2019s grade 2-3. 238 B. Simeone, et al. TTR amyloidosis is in turn divided into two forms, a hereditary form of autosomal dominant transmission, in which deposits can mainly affect the peripheral nervous system, the heart or both districts, and an acquired one linked to the deposition of un-mutated TTR or wild-type, called senile cardiac amyloidosis (\u201cwild-type\u201d TTR or SSA), in which the cardiological phenotype is predominant and neurological manifestations are limited to carpal tunnel syndrome, which is often the initial symptom in these patients and can anticipate the appearance of cardiological symptoms by 10 years (8), as happened in our patient. In elderly patients most commonly results from the transthyretin protein (ATTR) with almost a 20% annual mortality rate (9). In particular, in the case described a patient with an initial diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease subsequently developed an infiltrative cardiomyopathy caused by amyloid deposits. Therefore from the physiopathological point of view we postulated two possible pathophysiological hypotheses as the cause of the anomalous phenotypic evolution of our patient\u2019s cardiomyopathy: 1) The first hypothesis sees the coexistence of two different cardiomyopathies in the same person, with parallel course, in fact the initial diagnosis of hypertensive cardiomyopathy with moderately reduced diastolic function was evidently corroborated thanks to the improvement of the ejection fraction of the left ventricle following the electrical therapy with CRT-D implant. Over the years, however, the slatentization of cardiac amyloidosis from Transtiretin to overlap with hypertensive heart disease could have occurred. The coexistence of the two would therefore have led to a worsening of the diastolic function up to a full-blown picture of restrictive cardiomyopathy. 2) The second hypothesis, instead, is based on the possibility of an atypical manifestation of cardiac amyloidosis from wild-type TTR. In fact, initial signs and symptoms could be identified, such as the conduction system disorders (in this case LBBB), caused by the deposition of amyloid along specialized myocardial fibers or carpal tunnel syndrome. Over time the progressive myocardial infiltration of amyloid has led to the development of an intraventricular dyssynchrony, inducing the appearance of a dilatation-hypokinetic pattern. The initial positive response to the CRT-D implant and the subsequent clinical deterioration due to the relentless progression of infiltrative cardiomyopathy would account for the terminal evolution of the disease, with the development of a restrictive pattern. In both possible hypotheses overexposed, however, the final picture is attributable to heart failure caused both by a systolic and a diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiography is the main instrumental examination for the non-invasive diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. As in other etiologies, TTR-related amyloidosis is characterized by thickening of the ventricular walls with a typical \u201cgranular sparkling\u201d appearance in the absence of left ventricular dilation. The left ventricular ejection fraction is often normal, but alterations in the longitudinal contractility of the left ventricle (detectable with tissue Doppler and speckle tracking images) are frequent and appear in the early stages of the disease, when the shortening function radial is still preserved (10, 11). The combined analysis of transmitral Doppler and tissue Doppler frequently suggests high end-diastolic pressure and/or a restrictive filling pattern. The longitudinal strain also presents itself with a typical pattern that differentiates it from other cardiomyopathies: severe reduction of the deformation values at the base of the left ventricle and an \u201capical sparing\u201d (12). When in our patient the echocardiographic picture showed a strongly suspected picture of cardiac amyloidosis, not being able to carry out cardiac MRI because the CRT was not compatible with the method, we directed the patient to the execution of a total body bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-Oxidronate osteotrope (99mTc-HDP), which confirmed extra bone accumulation of the tracer at the left ventricle. For the differential diagnosis between the AL and TTRrelated forms, scintigraphy with 99mTc-HDD proved to be able to detect amyloid deposition in the myocardium in TTR-related forms (both mutated and wild-type) but not in the AL form (13, 14). The osteotropic tracer, in fact, binds to amyloid deposits with high sensitivity in wild-type ATTR in very early stages when echocardiography, biomarkers and perhaps even MRI are normal. Finally, on the basis of the negative molecular analysis resulting from mutations of transtyretin genes, the definitive diagnosis of senile systemic amyloidosis by transthyretin wild type was made. As for therapy, while the treatment of AL amyloidosis over the years has benefited from numerous chemotherapeutic protocols borrowed from myeloma therapy, with very long survivals, the treatment of transthyretin amyloidosis, until a few years ago, was limited supportive care based primarily on diuretics. However, with emerging therapies like Tafamidis, (a drug stabilizer of TTR molecule), that have the potential to improve patient\u2019s outcomes, early diagnosis has taken on an increasingly important role (15). Conclusions Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR) represents a rare disease with a rapidly growing but still largely underdiagnosed prevalence. We have presented an unique case of transthyretin-related cardiac amyloidosis, as a patient with an initial diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease later develops an infiltrative cardiomyopathy due to amyloid deposits. Initial manifestations of wild type ATTR may include carpal tunnel syndrome (especially bilateral) and spinal stenosis and these may precede the cardiac complications by several years (16). This must encourage clinicians to know the salient features of this disease, its characteristic signs and symptoms in order to maintain a high level of attention and then report suspected cases for diagnostic confirmation and possible treatment, hopefully before the onset of a severe and irreversible organ dysfunction.", "tokens": [{"text": "83-year-old", "start": 437, "end": 448, "token_start": 91, "token_end": 95, "entityLabel": "PATIENTONSETAGE"}, {"text": "female", "start": 459, "end": 465, "token_start": 97, "token_end": 97, "entityLabel": "PATIENTSEX"}, {"text": "gastritis", "start": 735, "end": 744, "token_start": 144, "token_end": 144, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"}, {"text": "gastric intolerance", "start": 667, "end": 686, "token_start": 133, "token_end": 134, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"}, {"text": "ASA", "start": 690, "end": 693, "token_start": 136, "token_end": 136, "entityLabel": "SUSPECTPRODUCT"}, {"text": "operated twice on a bilateral carpal tunnel", "start": 5441, "end": 5484, "token_start": 1022, "token_end": 1028, "entityLabel": "PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"}, {"text": "2004", "start": 5488, "end": 5492, "token_start": 1030, "token_end": 1030, "entityLabel": "PATIENTMEDICALSTARTDATE"}], "relations": [{"child": 97, "head": 91, "relationLabel": "PATIENTGENDER"}, {"child": 133, "head": 136, "relationLabel": "SUSPECTREACTION"}, {"child": 144, "head": 136, "relationLabel": "SUSPECTREACTION"}, {"child": 136, "head": 91, "relationLabel": "PATIENTSUSPECT"}]}, {"document": "Case Report Repurposing Drugs in Controlling Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Clear-Cell Ovarian Cancer Woraporn Sinsuwan and Phawit Norchai College of Integrative Medicine (CIM), Dhurakij Pundit University, Thailand Correspondence should be addressed to Woraporn Sinsuwan; doc.mil59@gmail.com Received 2 December 2022; Revised 11 May 2023; Accepted 31 May 2023; Published 7 June 2023 Academic Editor: Satish Gandhesiri Copyright \u00a9 2023 Woraporn Sinsuwan and Phawit Norchai.

Background. Recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer has a low overall survival duration of 7-8 months, making it a fatal disease. Currently, chemotherapy is the major kind of treatment, but it offers little advantage. Repurposed conventional drugs have recently been found to offer the ability to control cancer with few side effects and at a reasonable cost to healthcare organizations. Case Presentation. In this case report, we present the case of a 41-year-old Thai female patient diagnosed with recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer (PRCCC) in the year 2020. After undergoing chemotherapy for two courses and failing to respond to treatment, she began alternative medicine with repurposing drugs in November 2020. Simvastatin, metformin, niclosamide, mebendazole, itraconazole, loratadine, and chloroquine were also administered. Two months after therapy, a computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a conflict between a decline in tumor marker levels (CA 125, CA 19-9) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes. However, after continuing all medications for 4 months, the CA 125 level decreased from 303.6 to 54 U/ml, and the CA 19-9 level decreased from 1210.3 to 386.10 U/ml. The patient\u2019s EQ-5D-5L score increased from 0.631 to 0.829 (abdominal pain and depression), indicating improved quality of life. Overall survival was 8.5 months, and progression-free survival was 2 months. Conclusion. The response to drug repurposing is demonstrated by a four-month-long improvement in symptoms. This work introduces a novel strategy for the management of recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer that needs further evaluation in large-scale studies. 1. Introduction Advanced ovarian cancer is a very aggressive tumor and ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women. Treatment options in the recurrent setting are limited, especially in platinum-resistant patients who have a poor prognosis and a short survival time. These patients can enroll in clinical studies, try different chemotherapy regimens, or take advantage of the best programs for supportive care [1\u20133]. With a median overall survival (OS) of fewer than 12 months and a median progressionfree survival (PFS) of 3 months, the response rate to the next course of chemotherapy is 15-20% [4]. It typically takes 10\u201317 years to create a new anticancer medicine from testing to licensure, and additional time is needed for commercial acceptance [5]. Advanced cancer patients only have a short window of time to wait for cutting-edge new anticancer medications. The idea of repurposing medications entails using already approved medications for new uses. In oncology, it means using noncancer drugs to treat cancer. Thalidomide is an example of a medicine that has been repurposed; it was originally prescribed as a sedative to treat morning sickness in pregnant women. However, thalidomide was pulled off the market because we knew it had harmful negative effects on fetuses. Nevertheless, thalidomide was later approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma [6\u20138]. Drug development might take less time and expense with the use of molecular docking techniques. Molecular docking is a technique used to anticipate the orientation, contact, and affinity of the ligand-target complex. Noncancer medications are investigated using molecular docking techniques to locate target proteins in cancer pathways based on the current understanding of carcinogenesis and molecular pathways [7, 9]. Hindawi Case Reports in Oncological Medicine Volume 2023, Article ID 2079654, 5 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/2079654 The use of repurposed medications for ovarian cancer patients is not a recent development. Ritonavir, ivermectin, and COX-2 inhibitors are some of the older medications being studied by researchers to see if they have any anticancer benefits for ovarian cancer [10, 11]. The effectiveness of repurposing drugs like statins, metformin, or itraconazole alone or in combination with chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer has been the subject of numerous clinical investigations [12, 13]. In this case report, we offer a novel method for treating patients with recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer (PRCCC) by combining several repurposed nononcology medications. 2. Case Presentation The patient, a 41-year-old woman, was found to have an early-stage clear-cell carcinoma of the right ovary, in addition to being an inactive chronic hepatitis B carrier. In April 2019, she started to have sporadic pelvic pain. Endometriosis was not a medical history. A solitary mass was detected by ultrasound in the right ovary at the hospital. Increased amounts of CA 125 and CA 19-9 levels were found in the blood sample. In October 2019, she underwent cytoreductive surgery and six cycles of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. The result was a complete remission. The patient developed recurrent disease eight months later, showing signs of raised blood tumor markers and a rise in the quantity of intra-abdominal lymph nodes. The hospital\u2019s doctor restarted platinum-based chemotherapy, but the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis in her left leg and paclitaxel hypersensitivity during the third cycle. After three cycles of chemotherapy, the advancement of the disease on a CT scan is allowed for the diagnosis of platinum drug resistance. The last dose was administered in September 2020. Due to side effects, the patient declined more chemotherapy and sought other treatments. The patient came to our clinic in November 2020 with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1 [14]. She still complained of sporadic abdominal pain and depression. On a physical exam, her vital signs were stable. She was thin and mildly pale, with a mild degree of left leg swelling. Her current medications and supplements were rivaroxaban (15mg/day), clonazepam (2mg/day), trazodone (50mg/day), nortriptyline (10mg/day), beta-glucan, and apricot. Her prior blood tests revealed that her kidney and liver functions were normal. The hospital did not perform any cancer molecular testing or other specialized marker tests due to the resource-limited setting and the high cost of drugs, which patients cannot afford. The treatment program consisted of 5 weeks at our clinic in Bangkok, followed by continued use of only repurposing drugs and dietary supplements at home, a phone check-in, and a referral for blood tests every two weeks. The patient gave their consent after being fully briefed at the clinic. Every two weeks, she underwent a physical examination and blood tests. The current quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L Thai version questionnaire, and it was then repeated after 4 months [15]. Following a review of potential drug interactions between repurposing drugs and the patient\u2019s existing prescriptions, we began giving the patient simvastatin (20mg/day) in the second week after first prescribing metformin (500mg/day), mebendazole (500mg/week), loratadine (10mg/day), and niclosamide (2gm/day) in the first week. In the fourth week, itraconazole (100mg/day) and chloroquine (250mg every other day) were both administered. In addition, she received homeopathy, oxygen treatment, lymphatic therapy, highdose intravenous vitamin C, and mental support as required at the clinic. At the commencement of the treatment, highpotency supplements containing vitamins, minerals, melatonin, armor thyroid, probiotics, and phytochemicals were started. These included novasol curcumin (3gm/day), quercetin (2000mg/day), bromelain (6 gm/day), and milk thistle (750mg/day). As the treatment regimen continued, her abdominal pain, swelling in her left leg, and depression showed improvement, and she was able to stop antidepressant drugs. Serologically, her CA 125 level began to decrease after 2 weeks of the program and continued to decline. In the eightieth week, after she returned home, her CA 125 level decreased from 303.6 to 75U/ml (Table 1). We confirmed the response with a CT scan of the abdomen at a local hospital. A CT scan, which was compared between September 27, 2020 and January 6, 2021, showed an increase in both size and number of matted lymph nodes predominating at the upper abdomen and partial-recanalized chronic thrombosis without organ distant metastasis. Her symptoms were improved, so we suggested she continue taking oral supplements and medications. The EQ-5D-5L score increased from 0.631 to 0.829 after 4 months of therapy, which decreased pain and depression (Table 2). Along with the decline in tumor markers, the levels of CA 19-9 and CA 125 fell to 54 U/ml and 386.10U/ml, respectively. She experienced sporadic abdominal pain again at the end of the fifth month, and a blood test revealed elevated levels of CA 125 and CA 19-9 at 181.9U/ml and 925.2U/ml, respectively. The patient made the decision to discontinue all oral medications temporarily after we discussed drug modifications with her. She passed away in the middle of July 2021. 3. Discussion This case report shows that patients with recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer may be able to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life with a combination of repurposing drugs. The patient was able to perform daily tasks and go back to work normally without experiencing any severe toxicities. PRCCC, which stands for platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer, is characterized by its limited response to chemotherapy and poor prognosis with a short survival time [16]. This type of cancer often affects younger patients. Hemman and Rattanaburi conducted a study in the Thai population and found that patients with recurrent PRCCC who received an additional line of chemotherapy had an estimated survival time of 7.8 months [17]. The results of 2 Case Reports in Oncological Medicine our patient align with these findings, as she had a progression-free survival of 2 months and an overall survival of 8.5 months. After applying the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA 125 criteria to our patient to evaluate response in the relapse setting, we observed that the disease response began on December 23, 2020. A 50% reduction in the baseline CA 125 level (303.6 U/ml to 75 U/ml) was evident, and a confirmatory test conducted on January 28, 2021 showed a level (81 U/ml) that was within 10% of the previous test. We had to combine the findings of the CT scan according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) [18] and the blood CA 125 level together in order to meet the criteria for the GCIG evaluation for \u201cbest overall response\u201d [19, 20], and the outcome of combining both criteria was a progression of the disease at two months. Since controlling the disease and its symptoms, including toxicities from treatment, and improving quality of life are the ultimate goals of managing recurrent metastatic cancer [21, 22], we decided to continue medications when our patient reported that she was in better health and had no toxicity from treatment. The level of CA 125 decreased from 81 U/ml to 54 U/ml after using repurposed medications for 4 months, and the EQ-5D-5L score revealed improvements in pain and depression. The conflicting results between the reduction of CA 125 levels and the progression of lymph nodes on a CT scan could be explained by two possibilities. Firstly, repurposing drugs may work in a similar manner to biological therapy [23] by blocking multiple hallmarks of cancer [24], such as controlling tumor metabolism, inhibiting tumor proliferation [5, 10, 13], and decreasing inflammation, which can enhance the body\u2019s immunity [25]. This kind of therapy helps to slow tumor growth and reduce tumor activity rather than decrease tumor size; hence, repurposing drugs might not show tumor response by RECIST criteria. Secondly, the heterogeneity of tumor mass [26] could contribute to different responses, especially considering the exposure to multiple lines of chemotherapy or radiation, which can lead to the emergence of new mutations. While some cancer cells may respond to the treatment, others may not, posing a challenge for physicians to overcome. This heterogeneity within the tumor can account for the divergent outcomes observed in the patient\u2019s case. After 3 months of treatment, the CA 19-9 level was still higher than the beginning level. One study showed that CA 19-9 levels were higher in the metastatic setting compared to the occult primary setting in ovarian cancer [27]. In our patient, it appeared that the repurposing drugs were effective in lowering CA 19-9 levels, but they were insufficient to stop the mechanism of metastasis because the final CT scan revealed numerous more upper abdominal lymph nodes. After taking repurposed drugs for five months (through March 31, 2021), the patient experienced sporadic abdominal pain, and the edema in her left leg returned. Both the CA 125 and CA 19-9 levels had risen from 54 U/ml to 181.9 U/ml and 386.10 U/ml to 925.2 U/ml, respectively. The patient passed away in the middle of July 2021 after asking for all treatments to stop. Recently, Goenka et al. summarized clinical studies on repurposing drugs. The old generic medications that had been looked into included metformin, statins, proton pump inhibitors, itraconazole, and beta-blockers. The study\u2019s approach involved evaluating each medication either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Most of the studies were in first-line settings [13]. Our study is the first case report testing the efficacy of combined multiple repurposing drugs in a recurrent setting of platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer. According to the hallmarks of cancer, we hypothesized that using multiple drugs to block most cancer pathways might result in the desired outcome. This case report selected the study drugs from literature reviews that showed potential efficacy in controlling ovarian cancer, for example, metformin, statin, itraconazole, and chloroquine [12, 13]. We additionally included loratadine [28], mebendazole [5, 29, 30], and niclosamide [5, 31] to inhibit the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells, as well as their ability to repair DNA damage. According to a clear-cell subtype molecular study, ARID1A and PIK3CA mutations occur in 50% of cases. Metformin, statin, and itraconazole have the potential to block these PIK3CA mutation pathways [5, 32\u201334]. Developing countries, including Thailand, lack access to all drugs in the guidelines, especially expensive targeted therapy, and immunotherapy-related drugs. Therefore, researching the anticancer effect of repurposing drugs might result in a new alternative therapy for recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer patients.

When the patient\u2019s illness progressed, we were also unable to ask them to visit the clinic for an examination because of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand. 4. Conclusion There are currently few and ineffective treatments for recurrent platinum-resistant clear-cell ovarian cancer. Combining repurposing drugs showed tumor response by lowering CA125 levels and improving quality of life. Repurposing drugs also exhibited low toxicity profiles and was a welltolerated treatment in addition to the potential effects. A well-designed prospective study is needed to confirm the efficacy of the combined repurposing of medications, which seems to be a novel approach.

Here we report an unusual case of a patient with persistent hiccups caused by moxifloxacin. A man aged in his 40s was treated with moxifloxacin for tuberculous pleurisy. Hiccups occurred 2 hours after intravenous injection of moxifloxacin and lasted into evening. On the second day after injection, hiccups occurred again and made it difficult for him to fall asleep. The clinician ruled out gastrointestinal disease, nervous system disease, electrolyte disturbance and other factors. On assessing causality of the adverse drug reaction, the Naranjo scale for moxifloxacin was six, indicating a probable relationship of hiccups with moxifloxacin. Hiccups stopped 2 min after intramuscular injection of metoclopramide. To our knowledge, this is the first case report about moxifloxacin-induced persistent hiccups. Clinicians should be aware of the rare adverse reaction. BACKGROUND Moxifloxacin is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative and atypical pathogens.1 Adverse reactions attributed to moxifloxacin include gastrointestinal reaction, hepatic dysfunction, tendinitis and tendon rupture. Hiccups caused by moxifloxacin have never been reported in the literature. This case report brings the attention of clinicians and pharmacists to this rare adverse reaction, so that they can identify and deal with it in time. CASE PRESENTATION A man in his 40s was admitted to hospital because he had abdominal pain with fever for two weeks. The patient had a history of AIDS for 10 years, for which he received antiviral drugs including tenofovir, lamivudine, lopinavir and ritonavir tablets. He had no smoking or drinking history, and no drug or food allergies. He had a laparoscopic appendectomy in Taizhou Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital 1 week prior to admission. After the operation, the patient received intravenous latamoxef 1 g every 12 hours, but he developed a fever up to 39.9\u00b0C with shivers. Laboratory analysis indicated a white blood cell count of 9.7\u00d7109/L, a neutrophil ratio of 89.4% and C-reactive protein of 32.74 mg/L. He received intravenous fluconazole 200 mg every 12 hours. Repeated chest computed tomogram (CT) showed left lower lobe infection with left pleural effusion, a few fibrous foci in the lower lobe of the right lung and pericardial effusion. The patient still had fever and chills, but had no cough, expectoration, nausea, vomiting, dizziness or headaches. He was admitted for further investigation and treatment. On admission, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 39.6\u00b0C, heart rate 100 beats per min, respiratory rate 20 breaths per min and blood pressure 120/67 mm Hg. He had tenderness in the right abdomen, no rebound pain and three laparoscopic opening were seen in his abdomen. The patient received intravenous piperacillin/ tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 hours because of high white blood cell count and C-reactive protein He was also administered Biktarvy (one tablet daily). Serologic test of HIV RNA was 2.82\u00d7102 IU/ mL and CD4+T lymphocyte count was 180/\u03bcL, T-SPOT. TB>400 pg/mL. Sputum samples for tuberculosis infection were negative. Chest high-resolution CT showed left pleural cavity (partially encapsulated effusion) with left inferior lobe hypodilation. He received ultrasound-guided drainage of left pleural effusion on day 1, and his pleural fluid sample result was positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin. For this reason, he was started on tuberculosis treatment. The therapeutic regimen chosen for the patient comprised isoniazide, ethambutol, rifabutin, pyrazinamide and moxifloxacin. After approximately 2 hours of the first intravenous moxifloxacin, this patient began complaining of the onset of hiccups, which were persistent throughout the night. On day 2 of intravenous moxifloxacin, hiccups seriously affected the patient's diet and sleep. Moxifloxacin was suspected to be the most likely cause of hiccups, and was stopped. His hiccups persisted to that night and stopped 2 min after receiving intramuscular injection of metoclopramide. INVESTIGATIONS This patient had no previous history of gastro-oesophageal problems or persistent hiccups, no complaints of chest, abdominal or intercostal pain and denied having reflux esophagitis. No positive signs were observed in his nervous system. An MRI of his brain demonstrated no significant findings, and serum electrolyte was also in a normal range. Abdominal CT showed hepatosplenomegaly with a small amount of perihepatic fluid. The attending physician ruled out systemic causes of hiccups. Considering hiccups occurred after intravenous injection of moxifloxacin, clinical pharmacists scored six points according to the Naranjo scale, which combined with patient information, led to the conclusion that the hiccups were probably related to moxifloxacin.

Eur J Hosp Pharm 2023;0:1\u20133. doi:10.1136/ejhpharm-2023-003819 Case report TREATMENT This patient received intravenous moxifloxacin 0.4 g/day for 2 days and discontinued on day 2 because the persistent hiccups made it difficult for him to fall asleep. His hiccups stopped 2 min after receiving intramuscular injection of metoclopramide. No hiccups were observed at discharge 4 weeks later. OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP Hiccups were relieved 2 min after receiving intramuscular injection of metoclopramide. There were no hiccups until he was discharged. During follow-up for 4 weeks after discharge, the patient did not report hiccups. DISCUSSION Hiccups are caused by a sudden, involuntary powerful spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. It can be divided into three categories based on their duration: acute hiccups last for less than 48 hours, persistent hiccups last for more than 48 hours and intractable hiccups last for more than 1 month.2 There are multiple causes of hiccups in the aetiology, including infections (meningitis, encephalitis), central causes of hiccups (cerebrovascular diseases, demyelinating diseases, brain injury, brain tumours, etc), toxic or metabolic conditions, electrolyte imbalance, thoracic and pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal disease and psychogenic factors (ear, nose and throat diseases, over-excitement, anxiety).3 4 In addition, medications can also lead to hiccups, such as azithromycin,5 methotrexate,6 tramadol,7 aripiprazole8 and dexamethasone.9 This patient demonstrated a sudden and definite case of hiccups shortly after receiving moxifloxacin. Clinicians ruled out gastrointestinal diseases, nervous system diseases or electrolyte disturbance causes of hiccups. The Naranjo scale demonstrated a score of six, indicating a possible relationship between hiccups and moxifloxacin. Hiccups caused by moxifloxacin have not been reported, but levofloxacin-induced hiccups were reported in the literature. Zeng et al reported a case of a man treated with levofloxacin injection 0.2 g every 12 hours for pneumonia. Hiccups occurred on the third day and did not relieve the next day. Finally, hiccups stopped 30 hours after levofloxacin discontinuation.10 Moxifloxacin-related hiccups are rare, and the mechanism is not fully understood. The occurrence of hiccup involves a reflex arc including the afferent, central and efferent nerves.11 Hiccups are regulated by central neurotransmitters including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), gamma-amino- butyric- acid (GABA) and dopamine. Peripheral neurotransmitters regulating hiccups include norepinephrine, epinephrine and histamine.12 Moxifloxacin is highly lipophilic13 and penetrates well through the blood-brain barrier.14 Moxifloxacin binds to the GABA receptor when it enters central nervous system. GABA is a central inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in hiccup reflex and acts as an inhibitory medium by altering trans-membrane potential. 12 Reducing the binding of GABA or antagonising the GABA receptor can increase phrenic nerve excitability and phrenic spasm, thus leading to hiccup. Another pathway by which moxifloxacin could cause hiccups is that moxifloxacin can stimulate the stomach and cause gastrointestinal dysfunction, which then stimulates the vagus and phrenic nerves.15 The patient\u2019s hiccups relieved after 2 min of receiving intramuscular injection of metoclopramide, which could involve the following mechanisms. First, metoclopramide has important effects on dopamine and serotinergic (5-HT4 agonist) receptors. Metoclopramide can combine with the dopamine receptor, the phrenic nerve could be inhibited and the diaphragm could be relaxed, thus eliminating hiccups.3 Second, metoclopramide can reduce the intensity of oesophageal contractions and relieve the symptoms of hiccups.12 Third, the effect on serotinergic receptors can promote gastric emptying and reduce both gastric distension and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is implicated in hiccups.3 As for the rapid relief of hiccups; on the one hand, psychological factors cannot be excluded. On the other hand, the relief time was described by the patient and his family member, and may not be accurate. In addition to metoclopramide, there are numerous medications are commonly used to treat hiccups. Most of these medications act via dopaminergic or GABA-ergic receptors.3 They are comprised of dopamine receptor antagonist domperidone, GABA-B agonist baclofen and GABA analogue gabapentin. In addition, the antipsychotic chlorpromazine and the antiepileptic drugs sodium valproate, carbamazepine and gabapentin can also be used for hiccups.3 In conclusion, this is the first case report of hiccups caused by moxifloxacin to our knowledge. The mechanism of hiccups caused by moxifloxacin could be that it enters the cerebrospinal fluid to compete for GABA receptors and stimulate the stomach. Although hiccups are not life-threatening, they can be severely uncomfortable and significantly reduce quality of life, and as such, should not be ignored. Severe hiccups can affect eating, breathing and even sleeping. Therefore, attention should be paid to hiccups caused by moxifloxacin. Learning points \u21d2 Persistent hiccups is an unusual case of an adverse effect induced by moxifloxacin; clinicians should be aware of persistent hiccups in patients who receive moxifloxacin. \u21d2 The mechanism of hiccups caused by moxifloxacin could be that moxifloxacin competes for GABA receptors and stimulates the stomach. \u21d2 Metoclopramide, haloperidol, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, chlorpromazine and baclofen may be used to treat hiccups caused by moxifloxacin.

An 85-year-old man with a history of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in remission presented 4 years after definitive chemoradiation with new-onset dysphagia. Endoscopy with biopsy revealed high-grade malignancy consistent with neuroendocrine carcinoma. Treatment options were limited to chemotherapy because of hismetastatic disease, and he unfortunately died 14months after diagnosis.The occurrence of esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma in a site of prior squamous cell carcinoma is very uncommon, and this likely represents a case of radiation-induced malignancy. Therefore, when undergoing radiotherapy, patients and providers should discuss the possibility of this life-threatening complication. KEYWORDS: esophagus; esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma; radiation-induced malignancy; chemoradiation INTRODUCTION Esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (ENEC) is an extremely rare and highly aggressive malignancy that carries a poor prognosis.1 The incidence of ENEC between 2000 and 2016 was reported to be low at approximately 0.044 per 100,000 persons, and studies have demonstrated a 5-year survival rate of 4.8%.1,2 Over 50% of patients with cancer receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment regimen.3 Second cancer development is an established risk of radiotherapy, and neuroendocrine carcinomas have been shown to arise from irradiated locations.4 This report describes a rare case of ENEC presenting several years after chemoradiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the same location. CASE REPORT An 85-year-old Whiteman presented for oncology follow-up with 2months of progressive dysphagia to solids and no additional associated symptoms. The patient had no history of tobacco or alcohol use, but his medical history was significant for T4N0 grade I SCC of the upper esophagus diagnosed 5 years prior (Figure 1).He previously received chemoradiationwith 4-year remission confirmed by annual computed tomography (CT) and upper endoscopy; however, routine biopsies of the prior SCCsite were not performed during endoscopic surveillance. The previous total radiation dose received was 50.4 gray (Gy), and he was treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin for 5 weeks. Given his dysphagia, neck and chest CT with contrast was completed and showed soft-tissue thickening in the upper esophagus at the location of previously treated SCC (Figure 2). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed friable and ulcerated mucosa in the upper esophagus (Figure 3), with biopsies revealing high-grade malignancy consistent with poorly differentiated small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and no evidence of SCC (Figure 4). Immunohistochemistry staining was positive for synaptophysin, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, thyroid transcription factor 1, and CD56 (Figure 5). The Ki-67 mitotic proliferation index was 80%\u201390%. Abdominal CT also showed newly enlarged abdominal, retroperitoneal, and retrocrural lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm concerning for progressive malignancy (Figure 6). ACG Case Rep J 2023;10:e01091. doi:10.14309/crj.0000000000001091. Published online: June 19, 2023 Correspondence: Zarian Prenatt, DO (Zarian.Prenatt@sluhn.org). ACG Case Reports Journal / Volume 10 acgcasereports.com 1 Given the concern for metastatic disease, medical therapy was pursued instead of surgery. He was not a candidate for radiation because of previous radiotherapy to the same location. The patient underwent chemotherapy with etoposide and carboplatin, but he had disease progression evident on bimonthlyCTimaging 6 months after starting treatment. His treatment was briefly switched to irinotecan with subsequent treatment-induced diarrhea. His dysphagia worsened, and he required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. However, his treatment was stopped, and palliative care was initiated because of the lack of treatment response and worsening performance status. Metastatic lesions in the scalp were discovered on head CT, which were not evident on head CT 4 months earlier. The patient died in hospice care approximately 14 months after the diagnosis of ENEC. DISCUSSION The occurrence of ENEC in a site of prior esophageal SCC is a rarity. This likely represents an example of malignant evolution from radiation-induced injury. Radiotherapy is used to decrease cancer recurrence and improve survival. However, with improved survival, it is important to consider the long-term risks of radiation. Several studies have shown that radiotherapy increases the risk of second cancer development.5,6 Berrington de Gonzalez conducted a systemic analysis of 647,672 cancer survivors with an average 12-year follow-up. They found that 60,271 (9%) of those patients developed a second solid cancer, and their data suggest that approximately 8%of second solid cancersmay be related to the initial radiation treatment.5 Radiation-inducedmalignancy (RIM) is a delayed life-threatening complication of radiotherapy.7 The pathogenesis is thought to be due to DNA breaks with alteration in the DNA repair protein caused by ionizing radiation.3 According to the Cahan criteria, for a cancer to be considered radiation induced, the tumor must (i) occur within the previous radiation field, (ii) have temporal relation to the previous radiation with latency of at least 4 years, and (iii) have a different histology from the initial tumor.8 Our case likely demonstrates a case of RIM because it fulfills the above criteria.One study evaluated the risk of esophagealRIMin patients who received radiation for breast cancer and found the risk to increase by approximately 0.5% per Gy of radiation.9 A radiation dose of 50 Gy, as in our patient, would therefore be associatedwith an approximate 25% increased risk of developing esophageal Figure 2.

ACG Case Reports Journal / Volume 10 acgcasereports.com 2 Prenatt et al Esophageal Neuroendocrine Carcinoma cancer. Another study estimating the risk of esophageal RIM in patients who received radiotherapy forHodgkin lymphoma found the risk to increase by approximately 7% per Gy.10 In this case, a dose of 50 Gy would be associated with a 3.5 times higher risk of developing esophageal cancer. The low incidence of ENEC may be attributed to the underdevelopment of the neuroendocrine system within the esophagus.1 ENEC is usually located in the mid to distal esophagus, which is thought to be due to the predominance of endocrine cellswithin the distal cardiac glands and Merkel cells in the middle esophagus.11 Numerous case reports demonstrate that most neuroendocrine carcinomas develop in the distal esophagus and are associated with columnar lining, as seen in Barrett\u2019s esophagus.12 These findings support the conclusion that an iatrogenic cause contributed to the development of NEC in our patient\u2019s upper esophagus. Given the highly aggressive nature of ENEC, it is important to deliver timely treatments at an early stage.1 Unfortunately, Figure 5.

ACG Case Reports Journal / Volume 10 acgcasereports.com 3 Prenatt et al Esophageal Neuroendocrine Carcinoma treatment approaches are not well defined because of the small number of ENEC cases in the literature.13 Current strategies are based on protocols developed for treating NECs at other locations. 13 Although surgery is the preferred treatment, studies indicate that a significantly lower proportion of patients undergo resection compared with receiving chemoradiation.13 This is likely related to the aggressive nature of ENEC because metastases are often present at diagnosis, as in this case.14 Patients and providers should discuss the risk of radiation-related cancer, and patients who receive radiation should be followed closely for RIM. The literature on ENEC outcomes and the development of ENEC in a previously irradiated field is scarce, and our case adds to the limited information on this rare phenomenon. Extensive research is required to determine standardized treatment strategies for both primary and radiation-induced ENEC. DISCLOSURES Author contributions: Z.

Conly1,7,10*\u2020 and Alain Tremblay1,9*\u2020 Abstract Background: Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA is completed through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) from either oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs, critically important for diag\u2011 nostics but also from an infection control lens. Recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 patients can demon\u2011 strate prolonged viral shedding with immunosuppression as a key risk factor. Case presentation: We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrat\u2011 ing prolonged infectious viral shedding for 189 days with virus cultivability and clinical relapse with an identical strain based on whole genome sequencing, requiring a multi-modal therapeutic approach. We correlated clinical param\u2011 eters, PCR cycle thresholds and viral culture until eventual resolution. Conclusions: We successfully demonstrate resolution of viral shedding, administration of COVID-19 vaccination and maintenance of viral clearance. This case highlights implications in the immunosuppressed patient towards infection prevention and control that should consider those with prolonged viral shedding and may require ancillary testing to fully elucidate viral activity. Furthermore, this case raises several stimulating questions around complex COVID-19 patients around the role of steroids, efect of antiviral therapies in absence of B-cells, role for vaccination and the requirement of a multi-modal approach to eventually have successful clearance of the virus.

Background Te coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a global impact with signifcant morbidity and mortality. A positive upper respiratory or nasopharyngeal (NP) swab reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) molecular amplifcation test is commonly used to confrm the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control (2022) 11:28 Page 2 of 6 Risk factors for severe disease include older age, medical comorbidities, and immunosuppressed status [1]. Our understanding of COVID-19 has evolved as persistence of SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral shedding and recurrence of PCR positivity after one or more negative samples have been documented in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients [2]. While RT-PCR is a rapid and easily accessible tool, limitations include prolonged positivity in the absence of infectious virus, thus confounding clinical management around possible reinfection or relapse. Understanding the natural progression of SARS-CoV-2 infectious viral shedding is critical from both an individual\u2019s management but also for public health and hospital infection control. Initial studies suggest infectivity declines within ten days in immunocompetent individuals [3]. Immunocompromised patients (ICPs) represent a unique population whereby prolonged infectious viral shedding and infectivity may occur with disease relapse. We present a complex ICP demonstrating protracted infectious viral shedding for 189 days with three distinct COVID-19 clinical relapses associated with waxing and waning of positive viral cultures and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values. Methods Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected at regular intervals beginning shortly after admission and tested by RT-PCR, quantitative culture [4] and whole genome sequencing (Additional fle  1: Supplementary Material). Te patient provided informed consent with approval of the University of Calgary\u2019s Health Research Ethics Board (no. 20-0444). Case presentation Preceding availability of COVID-19 vaccination, a 58-year-old Caucasian male presented to his primary care provider with one-week of cough, low-grade fever, and general malaise. He was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma 10 months prior and received 6 cycles of chemo-immunotherapy (bendamustine and rituximab), achieving clinical remission, and received an additional dose of maintenance rituximab one month prior. An oropharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2, but he did not require hospitalization at that time. Twenty-seven days after the initial positive swab, he developed hypoxemia prompting hospital admission. Initial NP swab was negative (Fig. 1A) and computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated recurrent ground glass opacities (Fig.  1B) with bilateral interstitial pneumonia, compatible with COVID-19. Blood tests revealed lymphopenia (0.1\u00d7 109 /L, normal: 0.7\u20133.5\u00d7 109 /L) with increased C-reactive protein (57.0  mg/L, normal: 0.0\u2013 8.0 mg/L) and ferritin (2047 \u03bcg/L, normal: 30\u2013500ug/L). He improved with dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 10 days. However due to relapsing hypoxemia and radiographic progression, a diagnosis of organizing pneumonia as sequelae of COVID-19 was considered. Bronchoscopy was declined, and oral prednisone 50 mg daily was initiated with a planned dose taper. On day 90, 73 days post admission, following ongoing reduction of prednisone (10  mg), the patient presented with new onset of pyrexia and recurrence of hypoxemia. RT-PCR testing was again positive by NP swab (Fig. 1A, Ct 18.3). Te patient was re-initiated on dexamethasone with bronchoscopy performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage was  both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (Ct 18.7) and culture positive (1.17\u00d7 104  pfu/mL, wild-type G clade) and negative for bacterial, mycobacterial, other viral and fungal growth. Transbronchial biopsies (Fig.  1C) demonstrated active pneumonitis with occasional foci of organizing pneumonia, and patchy interstitial fbrosis. Symptoms were consistent with COVID-19 relapse and remdesivir was given (200  mg intravenous loading dose then 100  mg daily) for 5  days concurrently with dexamethasone (Fig. 1A). On day 107, there was clinical improvement with reduction in oxygen requirements to room air and RT-PCR Ct of 24.4 Subsequent investigations revealed hypogammaglobinemia (IgA 0.48 g/L, IgG 3.29 g/L, IgM 0.05 g/L (normal: 0.6\u20134.2 g/L, 6.8\u201318.0 g/L, 0.4\u20133.00  g/L, respectively), likely secondary to prior rituximab administration. He was initiated on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin. He clinically improved and (See fgure on next page.) Fig. 1 Depiction of prolonged COVID-19 viral shedding in an immunosuppressed patient.

Thornton et al. Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control (2022) 11:28 Page 4 of 6 was discharged home on day 107 with an oral dexamethasone (4 mg) taper. Viral culture load at time of discharge was not detectable. On day 118 the patient re-presented to hospital with respiratory failure. A repeat SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab was positive with Ct of 23.7and a viral culture load of 1.25\u00d7 101  pfu/mL, suggestive of ongoing viral persistence and a third COVID-19 relapse (Fig.  1A). SARS-CoV-2 testing failed to demonstrate remdesivir resistance (supplementary material). He was re-treated with another course of remdesivir for 5  days with modest clinical improvement. Repeat CT scans demonstrated persistent, migratory bilateral ground glass opacities (Fig. 1B). Subsequent medical therapy included bamlanivimab 700 mg (day 133; one dose), IVIG 75 mg (days 137, 165 and 193; one dose each) and a third course of remdesivir (day 146; ten-day course). Te patient demonstrated a gradual clinical recovery with progressive reduction in oxygen therapy and eventual negative swab by RT-PCR on day 189. On days 174 and 202, the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine was administered. On day 202 after initial presentation, he was ultimately discharged home with repeat COVID-19 swabs (days 209 and 224) negative. He has continued to improve with gradually increasing exercise tolerance. Notably, whole genome sequencing of the patient\u2019s viral samples over the duration of the time-period demonstrated an identical sequence belonging to SARS-CoV-2 clade D614G equivalent to the PANGO B.1 lineage viral strain with a specifc sublineage of B.1.160. A review of the local epidemiology during this period noted B.1.160 as the 12th highest lineage, accounting for only 1.4% of the those sequenced from the general population. Based on the sequencing results, relapse of infection by an identical virus strain was demonstrated rather than re-infection with diferent strains. Finally, serology testing completed was negative to the nucleocapsid antibody, however positive for the spike antibody (value of 1515.3AU/mL; positive threshold of>50AU/mL). Discussion and conclusions Cases of prolonged infectious viral shedding are emerging in the literature, including B-cell defciency where shedding of greater than 100 days has been reported [5, 6]. Te impact of COVID-19 on immune-defcient individuals and optimal treatment is unknown. Reports of patients post B-cell depletion therapy with spontaneous clearance of SARS-CoV-2 are known; however, others undergoing rituximab therapy had severe and prolonged COVID-19 infections with persistent detectable virus [7]. Tis case adds to emerging literature on COVID-19 relapse and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus shedding in the ICP. Such individuals may pose important infection prevention concerns for similar patient populations as they are often cared in clinical settings with other ICPs and may serve as unrecognized viral reservoirs for superspreading local transmission. Current CDC guidelines recommend duration of isolation for severely immunocompromised COVID-19 patients to be up to 20 days [1]. However, emerging reports have clearly demonstrated prolonged infectious viral shedding far exceeding this timeframe. In the hospital setting, isolation guidelines are of critical importance as prolonged infectious viral shedding poses risk to both patients and healthcare workers. Emerging data has highlighted the difculty in SARSCoV-2 eradication in those with blunted immune responses, prolonged viral shedding, and protracted clinical courses. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD20 molecule on the surface of B-cells leading to B-cell depletion lasting 6\u20139 months. Teoretically, the CD20 surface molecule is lost during B-cell diferentiation into plasma cells, the major source of circulating immunoglobulins, and efects on immunoglobulin production after short courses of rituximab should be a rare event but real-world experience has demonstrated reduced response to vaccines and reactivation of viral infections, such as COVID-19. A recent retrospective study revealed up to a 45% incidence of hypogammaglobinemia in rituximab-treated individuals, persisting up to 42 months, and 4% of patients failing to recover CD20 cellular function [8]. Na\u00efve B-cells, disproportionally depleted by rituximab, are critical to produce neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 [9]. Similarly, rituximab-treated patients often fail to respond to SARSCoV2 vaccines, suggesting that B-cells are required not only for viral clearance during natural infection but also for adequate responses to vaccination [9]. Treatments including remdesivir and dexamethasone have shown modest beneft in the general population, but efcacy is unclear in ICPs. Te use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in severely ICPs due to prior treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies had early promise with favourable safety efcacy early in disease course, but a recent randomized control trial failed to demonstrate beneft [10]. Similarly, while no strong evidence exists for use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment in ICPs, a rational argument for their use in such situations may be made, and in our case resulted in a signifcant but transient improvement in Ct values. Our study was unique in utilizing a multimodal therapeutic targeted approach and successfully allowing vaccination against COVID-19, while highlighting the profound efect of rituximab on the B cell lineage. Te patient\u2019s clinical course may also have been impacted by corticosteroid treatment. While Thornton et al. Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control (2022) 11:28 Page 5 of 6 dexamethasone can improve mortality in severe COVID19 illness, evidence in immunosuppressed individuals is lacking. Te development of organizing pneumonia following COVID-19 illness and associated use of prolonged courses of corticosteroids have been described [11], as highlighted in our case with hypoxemia improving with escalating steroid doses. However, despite initial improvement, additional immunosuppression may have contributed to prolonged viral replication with eventual viral clearance coinciding with tapering of corticosteroid treatment to physiologic doses. Regardless of the mechanisms of viral clearance, all anti-viral therapies attempted provided modest improvement in Ct values and cultivatable virus, although often with transient efect, highlighting the underlying impact of host immune defects. In conclusion, our case describes a prolonged clinical course with multiple COVID-19 relapses in an immunosuppressed lymphoma patient caused by the same strain of SARS-CoV-2. Our fndings have larger implications towards infection prevention and control guidelines that should consider prolonged isolation and rigorous followup. Use of quantitative PCR that are well validated and correlated with viral culture titres in parallel with Ct values may serve as a powerful clinical tool to elucidate infectious viral shedding, guide treatments, and assess outcomes. Response to specifc anti-viral treatments may be seen, but repeated interventions are likely needed due to relapse while waiting for efects of immunosuppressive agents such as rituximab to diminish. Te use of corticosteroids for organizing pneumonia needs to be balanced carefully with the risk of compounding pre-existing immunosuppression.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and tuberculosis (TB) are currently the two leading causes of death among infectious diseases. As we progress towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d, more information is required regarding post-COVID-19 syndromes. We present a case of latent tuberculosis reactivation 3 months after a successful inpatient treatment of COVID-19. A 74-year-old female from the Philippines presented with a new left mid-lung infiltrate with worsening shortness of breath and lethargy for one week prior to admission. The clinical course of the patient deteriorated despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, and high-dose steroid therapy requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her sputum culture yielded the microbiological diagnosis of TB. Anti-tubercular medications were started and the patient had a favorable clinical outcome. Our case demonstrates that immunosuppression secondary to COVID-19 and its treatments may promote the development of an active TB infection from a latent infection. It is important to be aware of this potential increase in risk during and after a COVID-19 treatment. This is especially important in high-risk populations to ensure an early diagnosis and prompt management as well as to reduce transmission. Prol, R.; Rawat, S.; Khunger, A.; Bromberg, R.

Introduction Academic Editor: Nicola Petrosillo With nearly 180 million cases, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly strained healthcare systems worldwide. Approximately 15\u201330% of patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and lung recruitment strategies to overcome profound hypoxemia [1]. Currently, immunomodulators have shown the most promise in reducing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 [2\u20135]. However, with the increased use of these medications, there is a heightened concern for immunosuppression and superinfections. In addition, COVID-19 has been shown to cause lymphopenia and impair cytokine circulation during the hyperinflammatory phase of the illness, which may increase the risks of concomitant infections [6,7]. In the past, superinfections in the acute setting were linked to increased ICU admissions, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Furthermore, this level of immunosuppression puts patients at an increased risk of bacterial, fungal, viral, and opportunistic infections. Tuberculosis (TB) remains the number one infectious cause of death worldwide despite global efforts to eradicate the disease. Approximately 25% of the global population has a latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with an estimated 5\u201315% lifetime activation risk [8]. As countries proceed towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d, there may be an increased incidence of TB secondary to active or recovered COVID-19 infections, whether or not immunosuppressant medications are used. Additionally, given that patient access to screening and treatment of TB may be affected by strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, there could be delays Received: 11 May 2022 Accepted: 8 June 2022 Published: 12 June 2022 Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.

Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended simultaneous testing for TB and COVID-19 when indicated as part of their strategy to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the spread of TB [8]. Screening for LTBI prior to or after a treatment for COVID-19 is not currently recommended in the guidelines for COVID-19 management. This paper describes a case of active TB presenting shortly after a successful treatment of COVID-19. 2. Case Presentation A 74-year-old Filipino female with a medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent type II diabetes presented to the emergency department (ED) of a South Florida hospital with a one-week history of increased generalized weakness and worsening shortness of breath. Three months prior, the patient was treated in the hospital for COVID-19 with intravenous dexamethasone and remdesivir, and was discharged home with oxygen. She fully recovered to her baseline and no longer required supplemental oxygen two months before the above onset of symptoms. On arrival to the ED, she was lethargic, but not in severe distress. She had an oral temperature of 37.5 \u25e6 C, a heart rate of 97 beats/min, blood pressure of 133/78 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 3 L nasal cannula supplemental oxygen. She had decreased breath sounds bilaterally and rales at the bases. Her heart sounds were distant without any murmurs and she had no peripheral edema. The initial laboratory results are available in Table 1. Her chest X-ray showed a left mid-lung infiltrate that was new compared with the X-ray three months prior (Figure 1). The computed tomography (CT) chest scan with IV contrast showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism. However, it revealed significant bilateral infiltrates (Figure 2) that had progressed from her previous CT chest scan three months prior (Figure 3). Her echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 39% and no other structural abnormalities. Table 1. Initial laboratory findings and results.

Rep. 2022, 14  449  Throughout the hospitalization, her hypoxemia worsened for which she required BiPAP and subsequently developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of the patient was thought to be multifactorial and was empirically treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and steroids for a suspected pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia vs. nitrofurantoin-induced pneumonitis as the patient received nitrofurantoin for a UTI one week before arrival to the ED. She was also treated with therapeutic enoxaparin for a non-ST elevation MI although it was likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of severe pulmonary disease. She remained febrile despite optimal treatment, prompting a further workup including a lumbar puncture 15 days after admission; however, the CSF findings were unrevealing for an infectious etiology. The patient had a worsening clinical course requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. An induced sputum culture sample obtained after intubation showed a positive AFB smear and positive PCR for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex. Subsequent induced sputum cultures were also positive for MTB, confirming the diagnosis of TB. Initially, the treatment regimen was rifamycin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE therapy) for MTB. However, the patient developed transaminitis within a few days so she started second-line therapy (linezolid, isoniazid with vitamin B6, and levofloxacin). The patient was also placed on pulse-dose steroids for presumed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with atovaquone. In order to improve efficacy, rifabutin was added, but ultimately the regimen was changed to ethambutol, rifabutin, and levofloxacin due to ongoing hepatotoxicity. Eventually, the respiratory status of the patient improved so she underwent a tracheostomy placement and subsequently improved enough to have the tracheostomy closed. Finally, the patient was discharged to a specialized TB inpatient center to complete six months of MTB treatment with rifabutin, levofloxacin, and ethambutol. 3. Discussion The above case illustrates the likely risk of a LTBI reactivation in a patient who had recently recovered from COVID-19 treated with steroids and remdesivir. Possible causes were the immunosuppressive sequelae of COVID-19, the effects of the treatment, or a combination of both. In any case, it is essential to consider the risk of a TB infection when treating COVID-19 patients, especially those who have emigrated from TB-endemic areas. For example, the patient presented in this case was an immigrant from the Philippines without other risk factors or known recent exposures. Therefore, the most likely conclusion was that it was a reactivation of LTBI triggered by COVID-19 rather than acute TB. Although TB is less common in the United States (US) than in the rest of the world, it is not rare, especially in areas with large immigrant populations. In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 9029 new cases of TB in the US with two-thirds of cases in non-US-born people (a rate 14 times greater than US-born people), and 591 cases in the state of Florida [9]. Unfortunately, although it is required to report cases of active TB to the CDC, it is not required for cases of LTBI. Therefore, there are only incidence/prevalence estimates provided by the CDC via the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which includes a medical examination and TB screening tests; these data are extrapolated to the civilian population. In 2015, the estimated national prevalence of LTBI in the US was 13.2 million [10]. Recently, it has been shown that COVID-19 infections affect the innate immune system and T cells, which are essential to prevent LTBI reactivation. For example, studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can cause T cell dysfunction and cytokine storms, leading to immunosuppression. Patients with COVID-19 have decreased numbers of lymphocytes, specifically CD4 and CD8 T cells; there is evidence that these cells undergo \u201cexhaustion\u201d, becoming dysfunctional/ineffective, and express an increased level of immune-inhibitory factors on their surface. These patients also tend to have increased levels of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 [6,11]. One case series showed that 46.4% of patients with COVID-19 developed a secondary infection with respiratory and bloodstream infections  \fInfect. Dis. Rep. 2022, 14  450  being the most common source; this risk was higher in patients receiving corticosteroids, but was also present in patients who did not receive corticosteroids. However, this case series had a high number of severe and critically ill patients, so it may not be representative of all COVID-19 infections [6]. Previous studies in mice have shown that a depletion of CD4 T cells is associated with the reactivation of LTBI. CD4 T cells are critical to the cytotoxic function of CD8 T cells via cytokines, and a depletion of CD8 T cells has also been associated with the reactivation of LTBI [12]. Multiple viruses\u2014including other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as viruses such as HIV, influenza, and measles\u2014have been shown to increase the risk of a reactivation of LTBI [13\u201315]. Other case series in TB-endemic areas such as China and Italy have increasingly documented COVID-19 and active TB co-infections. The majority of the current studies focus on co-infections or an increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with TB and vice versa, but little is documented on LTBI reactivation after recovery. In a study looking at patients with SARS-CoV, their cell counts took up to three months to normalize for CD8 T cell counts and up to one year for CD4 T cells [16]. Therefore, it is possible that an infection with SARS-CoV-2 alone could put patients with LTBI at an increased risk of reactivation. There are two other separate case reports of patients that developed an active TB infection several weeks after recovery from COVID-19 and these patients likely had LTBI (both were from endemic areas and one had a known exposure via a household contact two years prior; neither patient had previously been tested or treated for LTBI) [17,18]. Additionally, the treatment for patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen is steroids, which also have immunosuppressive effects. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for COVID-19 treatment recommend corticosteroids for a critical illness or severe non-critical illness as well as tocilizumab, which directly blocks the IL-6 receptor, for severe disease with signs of systemic inflammation [19]. Corticosteroids mainly cause immunosuppression via effects on the function of phagocytes and temporary reductions in lymphocytes, which are necessary for preventing LTBI from reactivating via granuloma formation and other activities [20]. There are limited data regarding whether tocilizumab increases the risk of an active TB infection, but corticosteroids have been shown to increase the risk of new TB infections and the reactivation of LTBI, usually with prolonged and high-dose courses. If a patient is going to be on a prolonged course of high-dose corticosteroids and has an increased risk of LTBI, it is recommended that they be screened with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing [21]. The same principle may need to be considered for patients treated for COVID-19. 4. Conclusions In short, we present a case of TB in the US of a patient from the Philippines who recovered from a COVID-19 infection treated with corticosteroids and remdesivir and subsequently developed TB three months after recovery. Given the history and patient risk factors, this was likely a reactivation of LTBI rather than a new acute TB infection. There are currently no guidelines regarding whether screening for TB should be considered in patients with COVID-19, whether they receive treatment with steroids or tocilizumab. However, it seems that, given the increasing number of case reports regarding a co-infection with TB and the possible reactivation of LTBI, it may be prudent to begin screening highrisk patients with COVID-19, especially severe cases that require treatment. There are increasing data in the literature regarding co-infections of COVID-19 and TB, but a paucity of data regarding the possible reactivation of LTBI long after treatment and recovery from COVID-19; this will need further investigation.

ECG CHALLENGE Long QT Syndrome and Torsade de Pointes Ultimately Treated With Quinidine Introducing the Concept of Pseudo\u2013Torsade de Pointes Sami Viskin , MD, Ibrahim Marai, MD, Raphael Rosso, MD ECG CHALLENGE A 36-year-old woman was hospitalized elsewhere after an episode of nocturnal seizures. Her family history is negative for sudden death. One week before the event she received esomeprazole and metoclopramide for abdominal pain, discontinuing both medications 2 days before the index event. Early morning on the day of hospitalization, while still asleep, she developed strenuous breathing. The loud breathing awakened her husband who noticed she was \u201cstiff,\u201d only to then become apneic and limp. She eventually regained consciousness but remained confused as she was transferred to a hospital. Her examination, blood tests, and echocardiogram were normal, but her ECG showed a prolonged QT interval (Figure 1A). She was therefore hospitalized with a presumptive diagnosis of arrhythmic syncope attributable to long QT syndrome (LQTS). Shortly thereafter, the presumed diagnosis was confirmed when she had arrhythmia documentation during a new syncopal event (Figure 1B). Beta-blocker therapy was initiated and no additional arrhythmic events occurred. The diagnosis of \u201cLQTS with documented torsade de pointes [TdP]\u201d seemed pretty evident. After all, this young woman with no organic heart disease had a QTc of 487 ms, representing the 99.91st percentile of the QTc for healthy females and the 70th percentile of the QTc for females with congenital LQTS. Furthermore, she had \u201cdocumented TdP.\u201d The young woman received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator that was programmed to pace the atrium with a lower rate limit of 70 beats/min and was discharged on a therapeutic regimen of bisoprolol 7.5 mg/d.

Reporter of the case is Dr. Joanna Smolarczyk-Kosowska from Psychiatry department in Medical University of Silesia. She resides in Katowice, Postal code 40-055 PL.  Patient is 71 years old female. Both the family and the patient on admission denied episodes of mania and hypomania in the past. The patient was hospitalized twice in the past due to recurrent depressive disorder 17 and 18 yea.. She confirmed the presence of the Jak V617F 12.5-31% mutation.  Smolarczyk-Kosowska J, Kosowski M, Kunert L, Filipczyk K, Wojciechowski M, Piegza M, et al.

DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.054991 July 6, 2021 87 Viskin et al ECG Challenge RESPONSE TO ECG CHALLENGE \u201cThere is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\u201d \u2013 Sherlock Holmes Although a diagnosis of LQTS seemed straightforward, 2 characteristics of the initial ECGs supported questioning this \u201ccertain\u201d diagnosis. First, although the QT interval is certainly long (a QTc of \u2265487 ms is seen in <0.1% of healthy women), most patients with congenital LQTS who actually develop TdP have significantly longer QT intervals. More important, the ECG shows ventricular extrasystoles with a short coupling interval (Figure 1A) and extrasystoles with shorter coupling interval triggering a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) wrongly labeled \u201cTdP\u201d (Figure 1B). Polymorphic VT that is triggered by short-coupled extrasystoles should not be accepted as TdP even if the QT interval is prolonged. In LQTS, excessive prolongation of the action potential is what generates the early afterdepolarizations that, when of sufficient amplitude, trigger TdP. This sequence of events dictates that in LQTS, the initiating beat has a long coupling interval. The coupling interval in TdP is 473\u00b191 ms and 588\u00b197 ms in congenital LQTS types I and II,1 and was invariably >400 ms in a recent study comparing TdP to other forms of polymorphic VT.2 Thus, the onset of VT in this case, with a coupling interval of only 342 ms, should be viewed as incompatible with TdP. The patient presented to our clinic weeks later. Her ECG now showed a normal QT interval and ectopic beats with a varying, often short (R-on-T), coupling interval (Figure 2A). A Holter demonstrated polymorphic VT triggered by extrasystoles with a very short (327 ms) coupling interval (Figure 2B). This led to the correct diagnosis: idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.3 We therefore hospitalized the patient and initiated quinidine therapy (hydroquinidine 900 mg/d). One hour after the first dose, she had recurrent polymorphic VT (Figure 3). The arrhythmia was pause-dependent, raising again the possibility of TdP. However, the QT was normal and the coupling interval of the triggering beat was, again, short (386 ms). Quinidine therapy was continued and led to cessation of ventricular arrhythmias. The patient was discharged home on hydroquinidine and repeated Holter recordings and implantable cardioverter defibril- Figure 2. Electrocardiograms recorded during follow-up. The 12-lead ECG recorded 3 weeks later, while receiving bisoprolol 10 mg/d (A). The sinus rhythm is 65/min, the QT and QTc are 360 and 401 ms. The retrograde P-wave (purple arrow) demonstrate the ventricular origin of the ectopic beat despite its relatively narrow QRS complex.

DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.054991 Viskin et al ECG Challenge lator interrogation confirmed the absence of arrhythmias. Three weeks later, however, hydroquinidine was discontinued because of an allergic skin rash. Within days, she developed frequent short-coupled extrasystoles and recurrent polymorphic VT (Figure 4A). We therefore performed radiofrequency ablation of the Purkinje extrasystole triggering the polymorphic VT (Figure 4B and 4C). The patient remains free of arrhythmias on no drug therapy for 6 months. The Concept of Pseudo\u2013Torsade de Pointes This patient was first diagnosed and treated as \u201cLQTS with TdP,\u201d yet she was ultimately treated with quinidine, a drug clearly contraindicated for TdP but extremely effective for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. In hindsight, the QT prolongation during her first hospitalization was probably attributable to recent therapy with esomeprazole and metoclopramide and was unrelated to her arrhythmias. This case reminds us of the importance of distinguishing between TdP, a polymor- Figure 3. Pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia recorded 1 hr after the first dose of hydroquinidine. Trace shows atrial pacing at 70 beats/min. The QT and QTc are 386 and 415 ms. Their pause-dependent initiation with the typical short\u2013long\u2013 short sequence could be interpreted as suggestive of torsade de pointes, but the coupling interval of the ectopic beat triggering ventricular tachycardia is too short (386 ms).

The diagnosis and treatment of PCC crisis, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as the first manifestation, is highly challenging, and traditional PCC management strategies are no longer suitable for these patients. Case presentation A 46-year-old female patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) following suddenonset acute respiratory distress and subsequent initiation of mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation. She was initially suspected of having a PCC crisis through the bedside critical care ultrasonic examination protocol. The computed tomography examination revealed a left adrenal neoplasm of 6.5cm \u00d7 5.9cm. The plasma-free metanephrine level was 100 times higher than the reference value. These findings were compatible with her PCC diagnosis. Alpha-blockers and fluid intake were started immediately. The endotracheal intubation was removed on the 11th day after admission to the ICU. The patient progressed to severe ARDS again, and invasive ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy were needed. Despite aggressive therapy, her condition deteriorated. Therefore, she underwent veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO)-assisted emergency adrenalectomy after multidisciplinary discussion. Postoperatively, the patient was supported by VA-ECMO for 7days. She was discharged from the hospital on day 30 after tumor resection. Conclusions This case highlighted the challenges in diagnosing and managing ARDS associated with PCC crisis. The traditional preoperative preparation protocol and optimal operation timing for patients with PCC are not suitable for patients with PCC crisis. Patients with life-threatening PCC crisis may benefit from early tumor removal, and VAECMO could maintain hemodynamic stability during and after surgery. *Correspondence: Keywords Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Critical care ultrasonic examination, Emergency adrenalectomy, Pheochromocytoma crisis, Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation Background Pheochromocytoma (PCC) is a rare catecholamine-producing tumor arising from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. A recent study showed that the annual incidence of pheochromocytoma was 2\u20138 cases per million inhabitants [1, 2]. However, no exact data are available on the morbidity or prevalence in China. The predominant symptom is hypertension with target tissue damage, such as hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy [1]. The PCC crisis is a rare, life-threatening endocrine emergency causing the sudden and massive release of catecholamines, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and multi-organ dysfunction [3]. PCC crisis commonly manifests with hypertensive crisis or catecholamine cardiomyopathy [3, 4], while acute pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as the primary manifestation is rare. The mechanism underlying noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and ARDS caused by the PCC crisis is not clear. It may be related to catecholamines contracting venules and lymphatic vessels behind pulmonary capillaries, thus increasing hydrostatic pressure and capillary permeability [5, 6]. Excessive amounts of catecholamines can cause cardiomyopathy. The International Expert Consensus Document on Takotsubo Syndrome proposed that endogenous catecholamine spillover related to pheochromocytoma served as a distinct trigger for Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) [7]. The common symptoms of TTS are acute chest pain, dyspnea, or syncope, which are indistinguishable from those of acute myocardial infarction at first glance. In some patients, TTS may be diagnosed incidentally based on new electrocardiogram changes or a sudden elevation of cardiac biomarkers. Surgical resection should be performed after the qualitative and localized diagnosis of PCC, but sufficient preparation is necessary before the surgery to prevent perioperative cardiovascular complications [8]. The guideline recommends that patients with symptomatic pheochromocytoma undergo alpha-blockade for 2\u20134weeks before surgery to normalize their blood pressure and heart rate. The treatments should also include fluid intake and a high-sodium diet to reverse catecholamine- induced blood volume contraction [8, 9]. Regarding the PCC crisis, the timing of the surgery is controversial. Some experts recommend to delay the surgery in patients with PCC crisis when they do not reach a steady state whereas others recommend an emergency tumor removal, which might increase the survival rate [3, 5]. As a new and effective artificial organ replacement support system, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), has saved many lives in treating acute and critical respiratory or circulatory failure and has received increasing attention from clinicians and critically ill patients. However, its clinical application in cardiopulmonary insufficiency caused by PCC is still unclear. ECMO was successfully used to treat refractory cardiogenic shock caused by PCC crisis, and elective adrenalectomy was performed after the cardiopulmonary function was stable [10]. A systematic review reported that 10 patients with phaeochromocytoma-induced cardiogenic shock underwent adrenal resection with extracorporeal life support and achieved good results [11]. However, urgent surgery assisted with ECMO in PCC crisis accompanied by ARDS is rarely reported. Therefore, we reported a patient with a PCC crisis characterized by recurrent ARDS, who underwent emergency adrenalectomy successfully with the assistance of veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO). The patient recovered and was eventually discharged from the hospital. Case presentation A 46-year woman was admitted to our hospital\u2019s obstetrics department to remove the intrauterine device (IUD). The patient had previously been in good health and didn\u2019t exhibit any fundamental illnesses like hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, headaches, palpitations, sweating, or fainting. On admission, the patient\u2019s physical examination revealed a body temperature of 36.5 C, an 80-beat heartbeat, 20 breaths per minute, a 110/82mmHg blood pressure, and no positive findings in the heart, lung, or abdomen physical examination. After admission, routine blood examination, liver function, renal function, and electrocardiogram showed no obvious abnormalities. The patient underwent IUD removal on October 22, 2021, the procedure time was 20min, and the blood pressure was normal before and during the procedure. Nausea and vomiting occurred half an hour and four hours after the procedure, and the symptoms improved after metoclopramide and tropisetron. However, she progressed into respiratory failure, a change of consciousness, and extreme perspiration 8h after the procedure. The clinical examination showed hypoxemia ( SaO2 64.7% on room air), tachycardia (140 beats/min), diastolic hypertension (139/126mm Hg), and cyanosis. Diffuse marble spots were seen in the abdomen and thighs, and moist rales were audible over both lungs. Thediameter of bilateral pupils was 8mm, with direct and indirect reflections of the light. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.0, a PaO2 of 52mm Hg, a PaCO2 of 51mm Hg, a markedly elevated serum lactate level of 17mmol/L, and blood glucose of 38mmol/L. The patient was intubated in the gynecological ward and transferred to the ICU. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed that a large amount of watery sputum gushed out from the main airway and lobar bronchi of both lungs. A critical care ultrasonic examination (CCUE) was used to evaluate the cause of respiratory failure immediately after admission to the ICU. The ultrasound examination revealed diffuse B-lines in the entire lung, suggesting severe pulmonary edema. The inferior vena cava collapsibility was 25%, suggesting volume insufficiency, a cardiac output of approximately 2.0 L, and a left ventricular apical wall motion abnormality. No thrombosis was found in the lower limb vein. The abdominal ultrasound showed a mass with an area of about 6.0 \u00d7 5.0 cm2 in the left splenorenal space. The patient received invasive ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen at 100% and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) because of persistent anuria and pulmonary edema. The laboratory data on an emergency basis showed an increased hemoglobin level of 16.3g/dL and leukocytosis of 28.61 \u00d7 109/ L with a normal C-reactive protein level (< 5mg/L) and 89.0% neutrophils. Her troponin I level was 8.668ng/mL, her myoglobin level 3909.0ng/mL, NT-pro-BNP level was 3549.61pg/ mL, her sodium 132mmol/L, and her D-dimer level was greater than 10,000ng/mL. The urine ketone and blood ketone contents were in the normal range. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with no change in the ST-T segment. The results of pulse contour cardiac output (PICCO) monitoring showed insufficient circulatory volume, a significantly increased extravascular lung water index of 33mL/kg, significantly increased peripheral vascular resistance, and an increased pulmonary vascular permeability index (9.7; reference interval 1.0\u20133.0). Based on the aforementioned results, the possible causes of propofol infusion syndrome, air embolism, acute allergic pneumonia, and diabetic ketoacidosis were excluded. The patient presented acute respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, consciousness disturbance, acidosis, and abnormal glucose metabolism after gynecological surgery. The levels of cardiac biomarkers increased significantly. Doppler echocardiography showed dyskinesia of the left apex (presenting as left ventricular apical ballooning). The patient had no evidence of infectious myocarditis and acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, we inferred that the patient had Takotsubo syndrome combined with a huge mass in the left splenorenal space. Therefore, we highly suspected that Takotsubo syndrome was induced by pheochromocytoma. Then, we performed abdominal computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the abdominal neoplasm when the patient\u2019s vital signs were relatively stable. A left-sided adrenal mass of 6.5cm \u00d7 5.9cm complicated with tumor stroke was seen on the CT scan (Fig. 1). Chest CT showed bilateral diffuse infiltration (Figs. 2 and 3). The blood catecholamine hormone test showed extremely elevated levels of metanephrine (3221.27ng/L, reference interval 12\u2013130ng/L), norepinephrine (10,785.34ng/L, reference interval 21\u2013150ng/L), adrenaline (512.63ng/L, reference interval 0\u201370ng/L), noradrenaline (946.71ng/L, reference interval 65\u2013400ng/L), and dopamine (742.40ng/L, reference interval 0\u2013100ng/L), compatible with massive catecholamine release in PCC. The diagnoses of PCC crisis, Takotsubo syndrome, and multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome were confirmed. The patient was deeply sedated and treated with fluid resuscitation and a high dose of an alpha-blocking agent (phenoxybenzamine, 20mg t.i.d.) orally. She was weaned from mechanical ventilation on the 11th day after admission in the ICU, and was ready to be transferred to the endocrinology department for preoperative preparation. On the 22nd day after admission to the ICU, the patient had dyspnea again, accompanied by the expectoration of a pink frothy liquid. CCUE screening showed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema; x-rays showed diffuse exudation of both lungs. The patient was diagnosed with ARDS, and invasive ventilation combined with CRRT was performed again. At this time, ICU doctors tended to achieve a negative fluid balance to reduce liquid exudation and protect the patient\u2019s pulmonary function. However, the endocrinologists, cardiologists, and urologists suggested continuous fluid intake to stabilize circulation and hence prepare for the surgery because the heart rate of the patient was still fast, about 110bpm. The blood pressure did not drop below 130/80mm Hg, and the skin was dry. The chest x-ray of the patient showed that the pulmonary edema improved after fluid restriction treatment, but the ventilator parameters gradually increased. On the 28th day after admission to the ICU, the patient was in a critical condition. The ventilator parameter settings were as follows: assist/control mode with volume control, the fraction of inspired oxygen 100%, positive endexpiratory pressure 14cm H2O, tidal volume 380mL, and peak airway pressure 50cm H2O. The P/F ratio continued to be less than 100mm Hg. Our ICU doctor considered whether the patient could be treated by an emergency operation. Therefore, a multidisciplinary discussion was carried out with national experts in endocrinology, urology, cardiology, anesthesiology, and respiratory and critical care medicine. Finally, two treatment schemes were designed: (1) continuing conservative treatment because the patient\u2019s vital signs were unstable and surgery had a high mortality rate; (2) emergency surgery because the patient had recurrent ARDS with progressive exacerbation despite medical treatment, suggesting that conventional medical treatment was not effective. If emergency surgery was not performed, the patient might die soon from respiratory failure due to the aggravation of lung injury caused by the continuous release of large amounts of catecholamines from PCC. After fully understanding the patient\u2019s condition, the patient\u2019s family members chose emergency surgical treatment, considering that ECMO could stabilize the patient\u2019s respiratory and circulatory functions during the surgery. The final decision was to perform an emergency adrenalectomy assisted by ECMO. The anesthesiologist pre-configured phentolamine, nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, esmolol, and other drugs to prevent a rapid elevation in intraoperative blood pressure, and pre-configured epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin, and other drugs to prevent acute circulatory failure that might occur after tumor resection. An urgent laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed with the assistance of VA-ECMO, involving skilled Fig. 3 Chest CT showed bilateral diffuse infiltration anesthesiologists, an abdominal surgeon, and ICU physicians. Her respiratory and circulatory systems were stable during the surgery with the help of VA-ECMO. One tumor measuring 6.0 \u00d7 7.0 cm2 was completely removed (Fig. 4). Signs of necrosis and hemorrhage were detected inside the tumor, and postoperative pathological biopsy confirmed PCC. The patient was treated with VA-ECMO combined with CRRT and prone-position ventilation after the surgery. Seven days later, VA-ECMO was removed. The mechanical ventilator was removed on day 22 of tumor resection. The levels of catecholamines and metanephrines continued to decrease after operation and returned to normal on the 21st day after the adrenalectomy. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on day 30 postoperatively. Unfortunately, the patient developed pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. 5). Figure 6 shows the patient\u2019s timeline of the clinical condition. Discussion PCC can release large amounts of catecholamines continuously or intermittently, causing persistent or paroxysmal hypertension, multiple-organ dysfunction, and metabolic disorders. The clinical manifestations were mainly headache, palpitation, sweating triad, and serious cases leading to hypertensive crisis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infarction [1]. However, the patient in our case had an insidious onset. She had no previous history of hypertension, which posed a challenge for diagnosis. The symptoms of elevated diastolic blood pressure, acute pulmonary edema, hyperhidrosis, nausea, vomiting, disturbance of consciousness, pupil changes, leukocytosis, disorder of glucose metabolism, and severe metabolic acidosis in the patient could be explained by PCC. However, the diagnosis of PCC is extremely difficult for patients with no history of hypertension and the onset of acute multiple-organ dysfunction. The critical care physicians quickly screen the causes of dyspnea through the CCUE program and achieve the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema and Takotsubo syndrome so as to provide clues for the diagnosis of PCC crisis. Thanks to the advancements in critical care ultrasonography technology in recent years, this patient was accurately diagnosed within 24h of admission to the ICU. There have been only a few reported cases of rapid PCC screening through CCUE. PCC crisis can be triggered spontaneously or by other causes, including tumor touch, trauma, surgical pressure in non-adrenal areas, and certain drugs (such as glucocorticoids, \u03b2-blockers, metoclopramide and anesthetics, etc.) [12]. Studies have shown that metoclopramide induces catecholamine release through dopamine receptor antagonists and 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 [13]. Fentanyl appears to have little effect on histamine release compared to other opioid analgesics such as pethidine, diamorphine, and morphine used in surgical anesthesia. These drugs may promote mast cell histamine release, which in turn triggers catecholamine release from PCC [12]. In this patient, only 0.1mg of fentanyl and 150mg of propofol were used during IUD removal. The patient had nausea and vomiting after surgery but no symptoms of dizziness, palpitation, or hypertension at that time. Metoclopramide was used twice after surgery. Therefore, the possibility of a crisis induced by metoclopramide was considered, but surgical pressure in the non-adrenal area and surgical anesthesia could not be ruled out. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA or the spike protein may exacerbate catecholaminergic activity, the adrenal glands have been shown to be a significant site of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA accumulation and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein production [14]. The literature has reportedly indicated Fig. 4 One tumor measuring 6.0cm \u00d7 7.0cm was completely resected Fig. 5 Patient had pulmonary fibrosis when she was discharged from the hospitala connection between the SARS-CoV-2 infection and the PCC crisis [15]. However, the patient was vaccinated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine 2months before admission. The coronavirus nucleic acid test yielded a negative result, and there were no pre-procedural respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or headache, so the patient did not consider COVID-19 or vaccine-induced PCC crisis. However, for patients with PCC or adrenal mass, we should be vigilant to induce PCC crisis when inoculating with the COVID-19 vaccine or diagnosing COVID-19. Pheochromocytoma can present with TTS. TTS was first named Takotsubo syndrome because the heart shape was similar to that of an octopus fish basket at the time of onset. Later, it was also called stress cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, or apical ballooning syndrome [7, 16]. The 2018 European consensus developed new international diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of TTS. Patients with TTS have transient left ventricular dysfunction. Midventricular, basal, or focal wall motion abnormalities or apical ballooning, and pheochromocytoma may contribute to the arbitrary syndrome [7]. An excess of catecholamines can cause cardiomyopathy. Catecholamines cause direct damage to the myocardium through calcium overload, oxidative stress, induction of apoptosis, promotion of fibrosis, and activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system. Catecholamines can also cause indirect damage to the heart via increasing oxygen consumption and decreasing the myocardial oxygen supply, which causes coronary artery spasms, endothelial injury, arrhythmias, and cardiac dysfunction [5, 17, 18]. The elevated cardiac injury markers in our patient could potentially lead to a misdiagnosis of myocarditis or acute myocardial infarction, but thanks to the discovery of apical ballooning in the heart and the mass in the splenorenal space by ultrasound, it provided an important clue for the final diagnosis. PCC, with pulmonary edema as the first symptom, is uncommon and usually leads to rapid death. It can be seen not only during the course of the disease but also after tumor resection. The causes of pulmonary edema due to PCC can be divided into cardiac and noncardiac causes. In most patients, pulmonary edema is cardiogenic and caused by cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and severe arrhythmias. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema was thought to be the result of a catecholamineinduced transient increase in pulmonary capillary pressure caused by pulmonary venoconstriction and altered pulmonary capillary permeability [19, 20]. Sukoh reported a patient with pheochromocytoma complicated by acute noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed the accumulation of pulmonary neutrophils, suggesting that catecholamines released by PCC might promote the accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs and contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS [21]. When our patient first developed acute pulmonary edema, the PICCO results showed a significantly increased pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI 9.7, reference interval 1.0\u20133.0). When she developed acute pulmonary edema for the second time, a color Fig. 6 Timeline of case progressionDoppler ultrasound showed that the systolic and diastolic functions of the heart were not restrained. It confirmed that the pulmonary edema in this patient was mainly noncardiac, suggesting that catecholamine hormones played a special role in the occurrence and development of pulmonary edema and ARDS. However, the specific pathophysiological basis needs further investigation. The mortality rate of PCC is reported to be 15%\u201330% [22]. Functional adrenal tumors are usually an indication for surgery, regardless of their size [8]. Major preoperative preparations include controlling blood pressure with selective or nonselective \u03b1-blockers and increasing fluid intake. Surgery should be performed after the patient has achieved blood volume recovery, stable blood pressure, and improvement in hypermetabolic syndrome and glucose metabolism abnormalities [1]. Evidence to determine the best target blood pressure and cardiac status is insufficient. In 2007, the Endocrine Society recommended that the goal be to achieve a target blood pressure of less than 130/80mm Hg while sitting, no less than 80/45mm Hg while standing, and a target heart rate of about 60\u20130bpm when sitting and 70\u201380 beats per minute while standing [23]. For severe complications, the time of preoperative preparation should be extended. However, still, no guidelines or expert consensus exists to recommend the timing of surgery for patients in PCC crisis; also, a clear indication of emergency surgery for PCC is lacking. Uchida et al. [24] believed that emergency surgery was feasible when PCC was life-threatening because it could cut off the source of adrenaline release and stabilize the condition quickly. Kakoki reported a 70-year-old patient with PCC crisis who was treated with \u03b1-blockers. However, his respiratory status, liver function, and renal function deteriorated progressively. An emergency left adrenalectomy was performed despite his critical condition. The patient was removed from the ventilator support two days after the surgery [25]. If the patient\u2019s condition worsened after receiving appropriate treatment for PCC, the tumor needed to be removed urgently, even if the patient was in a critical condition, as this might increase the patient\u2019s chances of survival [5]. Thalia Bekelaar [26] showed that seven patients with life-threatening catecholamine crisis underwent emergency adrenalectomy and all survived, suggesting that patients with PCC crisis might benefit from emergency surgery. However, some scholars [3, 27] found that the incidence of perioperative complications and mortality due to emergency surgery were higher than those due to elective surgery, and that emergency surgery should be considered when tumor rupture or uncontrollable bleeding occurs in PCC crisis. When the patient in our case developed ARDS for the second time, the ventilator support parameters were already high, and the P/F ratio continued to be less than 100mm Hg under pure oxygen inhalation. If the preoperative preparation was done according to the conventional treatment plan for patients with pheochromocytoma, the patients might die of ARDS in a short time. Emergency surgery was the only way to stop the disease progression, but the risk of death in emergency surgery was also quite high with such poor cardiopulmonary function. The tumor size in the patient was huge. The postoperative specimens also found that the tumor had serious internal hemorrhage and necrosis, indicating that the tumor was active, and a large number of catecholamines formed a catecholamine pool inside the tumor. The tumor released a large amount of catecholamines in a short time, leading to the repeated and rapid progress of the patient\u2019s disease. Therefore, emergency surgery might be the only way to save the patient\u2019s life. VA-ECMO was used in PCC crisis with severe cardiogenic shock, adrenal resection was performed after hemodynamic stability, and VA-ECMO was removed [28, 29]. However, delayed surgery also increases the risk of recurrent crisis and multi-organ dysfunction, which can be fatal once the disease occurs at this stage. For example, Manita Chudhary [30] reported a patient with PCC crisis who received veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) treatment for severe ARDS, but soon he developed cardiogenic shock and received VA-ECMO support. VA-ECMO was removed 4days later, but the patient developed severe and progressive ARDS again, requiring 100% oxygen, high positive endexpiratory pressure, and paralysis-prone positioning. He had to be treated with VV-ECMO again. He underwent a VV-ECMO-supported laparoscopic adrenalectomy a week later. The patient\u2019s life was saved successfully. However, if the patient underwent VA-ECMO-assisted adrenalectomy immediately after confirming the diagnosis of PCC, he probably wouldn\u2019t have PCC-induced persistent severe ARDS. Emergency surgery assisted by VA-ECMO would greatly reduce the probability of recurrent PCC crisis, medical costs, and length of hospital stay. In our patient, the tumor was successfully removed with the assistance of VA-ECMO. The intraoperative blood pressure and oxygen saturation were basically stable, with no intractable hypotension after tumor resection, indicating that patients in PCC crisis could benefit from emergency adrenal resection assisted by VA-ECMO. Unfortunately, our patient had pulmonary fibrosis when she was discharged from the hospital. It also suggested that the timing of surgery for our patient could actually be earlier, such as when the PCC crisis was identified or when the ARDS was stable, and the patient could be extubated for the first time. However, this strategy must be carefully considered because patients with complete heparinization have a high risk of bleeding at the surgical site. The clinical value of VA-ECMO-assisted emergency adrenalectomy still needs more prospective studies for confirmation. Conclusions This case highlighted the challenges in diagnosing and managing ARDS associated with the PCC crisis. The traditional preoperative preparation plan and the operation timing for patients with PCC are not suitable for patients with PCC crisis. Delaying surgery to achieve organ stability may lead to recurrent crisis and multiple- organ dysfunction or even death. Patients with lifethreatening PCC crisis may benefit from emergency adrenal resection, and VA-ECMO can maintain hemodynamic stability during and after emergency surgery. At present, guidelines and expert consensus on the management of PCC crisis are lacking, and relevant guidelines and expert consensus need to be urgently formulated to guide clinical treatment.

toabiraterone and rosuvastatin Acute kidney injury (AKI) in association with rhabdomyoly-sis is quite common. Depending on the patient\u2019s comorbidity,an association of up to 30% has been reported between casesof rhabdomyolysis and AKI.1,2We distinguish between trau-matic and non-traumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis and it isnotable that an increasing percentage of cases are now due tonon-traumatic causes associated with commonly used drugs.In addition, associated risk factors have been described, suchas advanced age, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypothy-roidism, inflammatory or metabolic myopathies and trauma.In a population that is becoming progressively older and withpolypharmacy, there is an ever-greater risk of drug interac-tions. We report a representative case. This was an 89-year-old male, former smoker withhypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, hypothyroidism,dyslipidaemia, stage G3bA1 chronic kidney disease (basalcreatinine: 1.9 mg/dl; glomerular filtration rate [GFR] CKD-EPI: 32 ml/min/1.73 m2) and sleep apnoea, who was admittedto hospital with severe rhabdomyolysis. He had suffereda lacunar stroke 10 years earlier with residual ataxia-hemiparesia and had grade iv bladder cancer in situ, treated bytransurethral resection (TUR). Twelve years before he had beendiagnosed with grade iv prostate adenocarcinoma, treated byradiotherapy combined with hormone therapy. Five years ear-lier he had received a second treatment with radiotherapy andtwice-yearly triptorelin, due to biochemical progression withthe development of bone metastases. One year earlier, he had suffered an episode of severerhabdomyolysis (creatine phosphokinase [CPK] 13,000 IU/l),secondary to an accidental fall with trauma, which wasaccompanied by non-oliguric AKI stage 3 and a good responseDOI of original article:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nefro.2021.04.014.to conservative treatment. At that time, he was being treatedwith levothyroxine, candesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, acetyl-salicylic acid, rosuvastatin, triptorelin and omeprazole. Onemonth earlier, due to the progression of the prostate disease(pulmonary nodules, retrocrural and retroperitoneal lym-phadenopathy), a new line of treatment was started withoral abiraterone 1000 mg/24 h and prednisone. In addition tothe treatment described, he was taking the following drugs:calcifediol, calcium carbonate, bisoprolol, cetirizine and deno-sumab. A year later, he was admitted to hospital after an acciden-tal fall with a low-back contusion. The patient was also foundto have AKI and severe rhabdomyolysis (Table 1). Obstruc-tive uropathy was ruled out by renal ultrasound. Supporttreatment was started, with little response and progres-sive development of congestive heart failure, requiring acutehaemodialysis and ultrafiltration from day three of admis-sion. His CPK returned to normal on day ten after admission.Despite clinical recovery, the patient remains dependent onhaemodialysis. Abiraterone is a CYP17A1 inhibitor approved by the Foodand Drug Administration in 2011 for metastatic prostate can-cer. It blocks the synthesis of androgens in the prostate,testicles and adrenal glands, causing an increase in thesynthesis of ACTH and mineralocorticoids by inhibiting theenzyme 17\u0002 hydroxylase. This can induce hypokalaemia, diar-rhoea, elevated blood pressure, oedema and impaired liverfunction. It does not interact directly with the metabolismof statins, but it does inhibit a transporter, hepatic organicanion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), dependent onthe SLCO1B1 gene, which is a substrate for rosuvastatin. Thiscan reduce the uptake of abiraterone by the liver resultingan increase in its levels. In addition, we know that in certainpolymorphic variants in which the transport activity is geneti-cally reduced,3,4it can induce an increase in the concentrationof rosuvastatin, with the risk of toxicity and rhabdomyoly-sis.  It is rapidly absorbed orally and is metabolised almost exclusively in the liver, being 99% bound to plasma proteinsand reaching a maximum plasma concentration at two hours.Its metabolism in the liver uses two enzymatic pathways:cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A4; and sulfotransferase (SULT) 2A1.It is excreted mainly through the faeces, with less than 5%being excreted through the urine.5Marbury et al.5studiedthe metabolism of abiraterone in severe renal failure andconcluded that there are no clinically appreciable pharma-cokinetic differences between patients with preserved renalfunction and renal failure. A few cases have been described in the literature in whichabiraterone was used in patients with advanced AKI and onhaemodialysis. However, although anecdotal, this would sup-port its safety. 6,7Three cases of rhabdomyolysis induced by abirateronein combination with rosuvastatin have been published todate.1,2,8In two of these cases, in addition to rosuvastatin,there was a third drug associated: denosumab. In our case,the patient scored seven points on the Horn Drug InteractionProbability Scale and six on the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reac-tion Probability Scale,9,10which meets criteria for significantprobability. The patient began with severe rhabdomyolysis whichinduced AKI, requiring haemodialysis. It could be hypoth-esised that the abiraterone triggered liver failure leadingto increased concentrations of rosuvastatin and abirateroneitself. In an older adult patient with hypothyroidism, previousrenal failure, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitors and diuretics, dehydration, prolonged immobilitydue to his neurological sequelae, and polypharmacy (13 drugs),the chance of interactions is very high.11This case illustratesthe importance of close follow-up in patients with polyphar-macy and high levels.

Email: nour.elkhateeb@nhs.net Communicating Editor: Brian Fowler Abstract Classical homocystinuria (HCU) is caused by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase deficiency leading to impaired homocysteine transsulfuration and accumulation of homocysteine and methionine. Patients present with a wide spectrum of manifestations including ocular, skeletal, neuropsychiatric, and vascular manifestations. We report a 48-year-old female with pyridoxine-unresponsive HCU treated with betaine, cyanocobalamin, and folate. Her diet was non-restricted due to intolerance of low-methionine diet. She was admitted to hospital following a fall, with multiple fractures and subsequently developed acute liver failure with encephalopathy. Shock, sepsis, and liver ischaemia/thrombosis were excluded. In the context of glutathione depletion expected in HCU, hepatic dysfunction was presumed to be due to iatrogenic paracetamol toxicity, despite paracetamol intake at conventional therapeutic dose, with role of hypermethioninemia as a contributing factor being uncertain. Betaine was discontinued on hospital admission. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion was initiated. Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) was 3.4 \u03bcmol/L 9 days following initiation of NAC treatment with a markedly elevated plasma methionine of 1278 \u03bcmol/ L. tHcy concentration returned to pre-admission baseline after NAC was discontinued. Recovery following this episode was slow with a prolonged cholestatic phase and gradual improvement in jaundice and coagulopathy. We recommend that paracetamol should be administered cautiously in HCU patients due to underlying glutathione depletion and risk of toxicity even at therapeutic doses. NAC is clearly effective in lowering tHcy in classical HCU in the short-term however further research is required to assess clinical efficacy and use as a potential therapy in classical HCU.

Clinical manifestations include ocular, skeletal, neuropsychiatric, and vascular manifestations, with a milder phenotype observed in pyridoxine-responsive patients,1,9 and possible asymptomatic CBS deficiency found in some individuals who are homozygous for the CBS c.833T>C (p.Ile278Thr) variant.10 In the current study, we report an adult patient with pyridoxine non-responsive HCU on betaine therapy who developed acute liver failure in the context of paracetamol toxicity, with markedly elevated methionine. We report the potential therapeutic role of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in lowering plasma tHcy in HCU. 2 | CASE REPORT We report a 48-year-old female with a diagnosis of pyridoxine-unresponsive HCU. The diagnosis was established at age 2 years following lens subluxation and biochemical confirmation. The patient developed several complications of HCU including learning difficulties, behavioural and mood issues, severe visual impairment (left dislocated lens and right aphakia following vitrectomy with lens extraction for lens subluxation), skeletal complications (osteoporosis, scoliosis and history of tibial fracture), vascular parkinsonism and thrombotic complications (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] in left leg at age 46 years). She remained on a non-restricted diet, due to intolerance of the special diet, and treatment with betaine 6 g three times daily (TDS), cyanocobalamin 50 mcg daily and folic acid 5 mg daily. She continued on anticoagulation with direct-acting oral anticoagulant (rivaroxaban 20 mg daily) since DVT diagnosis. At age 48 years, she sustained an unwitnessed fall, presumably secondary to her visual impairment. A trauma sequence CT scan identified a moderate left pneumothorax with extensive left rib fractures creating a flail segment, multiple fractures of the spinal transverse processes and a left gleno-humeral fracture. A left sided chest drain was inserted. Blood tests on admission demonstrated normal kidney function and standard liver blood tests showed a total bilirubin (Tbil) of 22 \u03bcmol/L, serum alanine transaminase (ALT) 59 U/L, and serum albumin 33 g/L (Table 1). Conservative management with analgesia and left collar and sling was advised for the multiple fractures. The patient was started on serratus plane block, a fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia, gabapentin 100 mg TDS and paracetamol 1 g four times daily orally or intravenously (iv) if not tolerated orally. Oral betaine was withheld on admission as the patient was nauseated and vomited intermittently and had reduced oral intake since admission. Her weight on admission was 66.8 kg. Her weight on Day 7 on admission was recorded as 57 kg (change \u00019.8 kg/14.6%). Ten days after admission she became severely hypoglycaemic with an unrecordable blood glucose concentration that was corrected with oral fast acting dextrose gel, glucagon intramuscularly and 500 mL 10% iv dextrose. She had an episode of large volume coffee ground vomiting. Blood tests at that time were consistent with acute liver failure (ALT 3789 U/L, serum alkaline phosphatase [ALP] 240 U/L, Tbil 129 \u03bcmol/L) with elevated plasma lactate and CRP with normal kidney function (Table 1), plasma ammonia was 118 \u03bcmol/L (and subsequently dropped to 87 \u03bcmol/L; reference range 11\u201330 \u03bcmol/L) which was attributed to acute liver failure. She was drowsy with Grade II hepatic encephalopathy and a hepatic flap. Neuroimaging was not done at that time. The working diagnosis was acute liver failure secondary to paracetamol toxicity. The patient received 26 g of paracetamol in the 240 h after her first dose of paracetamol SYNOPSIS Patients with classical homocystinuria are at risk of acute liver failure due to paracetamol toxicity that may develop even at therapeutic doses. NAcetylcysteine is effective in lowering total plasma homocysteine in classical homocystinuria in the short-term.

She never received more than 4 g paracetamol in any one 24-h period. Plasma paracetamol concentration was not measured at that time. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), given iv vitamin K and started NAC at a dose of 8.4 g over 1 h, 2.8 g over 4 h, and then 5.5 g over 16 h. She was also started on broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals to cover for infection. An urgent triple phase liver CT scan demonstrated patent hepatic vasculature and excluded hepatic ischemia as the cause of acute liver failure. Viral, autoimmune hepatitis screening, and Wilson disease screening were negative. Rivaroxaban was discontinued due to the coagulopathy. She continued NAC at 5.5 g per 16 h, daily for a further 26 days. Biochemical testing at 10 days following onset of acute liver failure showed a plasma tHcy of 3.4 \u03bcmol/L and a markedly elevated plasma methionine of 1278 \u03bcmol/L. By that time, she had returned to her baseline neurological status and did not show clinical features of brain oedema, increased intracranial pressure or seizures. After NAC was discontinued for 9 days, plasma tHcy increased to 64.6 \u03bcmol/L, comparable to her preadmission baseline, and plasma methionine peaked at 1410 \u03bcmol/L, which gradually recovered to 512 \u03bcmol/L prior to discharge, comparable to her baseline levels. Hepatic recovery following this episode of acute liver failure was slow with a prolonged cholestatic phase and gradual improvement in jaundice and coagulopathy (Table 1). There were concerns regarding possible postnecrotic cirrhosis; a liver biopsy showed features of steatohepatitis with macrovesicular steatosis, necroinflammation, cholestasis and advanced acute/subacute fibrosis. This was associated with inconspicuous inflammatory infiltrate with prominent plasma cells (Figure 1). Recovery was also complicated by pulmonary oedema secondary to hypoalbuminemia; ileus secondary to hypokalaemia; feeding intolerance and vomiting with a long period of nasojeujenal and nasogastric feeding. She required several blood transfusions for epistaxis secondary to coagulopathy. The patient was discharged following an admission of 97 days including 14 days in ICU. On discharge, she was fully conscious and tolerating oral intake. She continues on unrestricted diet (as the patient declined to commence on a low-methionine diet or resume betaine treatment) in addition to folic acid and cyanocobalamin. Anticoagulation was resumed after resolution of coagulopathy. She is not receiving betaine. Her ALT is within the normal range while bilirubin has marginally increased post-discharge. Post-discharge plasma tHcy and methionine remain elevated (Table 1). Plasma cysteine or cystine concentrations were not measured in the past or during the admission. 3 | DISCUSSION We describe an adult patient with pyridoxine nonresponsive HCU on betaine treatment who presented with acute liver failure in the context of presumed iatrogenic paracetamol toxicity. Intravenous NAC has reduced plasma tHcy in the patient. FIGURE 1 Histopathological abnormalities in the liver biopsy.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Acute liver failure has been previously reported in patients with HCU. In a previous report, an 18-year-old patient with poorly controlled HCU (who was on betaine treatment) developed acute liver failure after paracetamol intake, with a paracetamol level not suggestive of overdose of paracetamol. Plasma methionine was markedly raised up to 1366 \u03bcmol/L. The patient showed complete recovery of liver function.11 This was a similar presentation to our case, where acute liver failure developed because of presumed paracetamol toxicity with a conventionally therapeutic dose of paracetamol. Another report reported a 31-year-old patient with late-treated HCU (treatment started at age 22 years) who developed liver cirrhosis and chronic liver failure and required liver transplantation.12 Liver abnormalities have been reported in CBS-knockout mice including enlarged hepatocytes with microvesicular lipid droplets,13 inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis with evidence of oxidative stress with subsequent mitochondrial damage leading to liver injury.14 These changes are similar to the ones reported in our patient's liver biopsy. Cysteine is a semi-essential amino acid that is essential for synthesis of glutathione (GSH),15 which is a tripeptide (glutamate\u2013cysteine\u2013glycine) and an antioxidant with a key role in cellular protection from endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is essential for mitochondrial function and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA.16 Decreased concentrations of plasma cysteine and liver GSH were shown in CBSdeficient mice despite adequate dietary cysteine intake.17 In addition, disturbed GSH metabolism with significantly decreased total and reduced GSH and increased oxidised GSH was reported in patients with combined methylmalonic aciduria with HCU due to Cobalamin C defect.18 Thus, disturbed redox homeostasis and subsequent oxidative stress is implicated in the pathophysiology of HCU, which has shown by in vivo and in vitro studies.19,20 Betaine is a methyl donor for betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase enzyme which catalyses the remethylation of Hcy to methionine in the liver. It is used in treatment of HCU, yet it does not fully correct the level of tHcy in HCU patients and increases plasma methionine level.8,21 Cerebral oedema and hypermethioninaemia encephalopathy with reversible neuroimaging abnormalities have been reported in patients on betaine therapy with plasma methionine levels close or exceeding 1000 \u03bcmol/L.21\u201323 Plasma methionine levels have been reported to range from normal to extremely high in patients with fulminant hepatic failure, due to disturbed methionine metabolism.24,25 We report elevated concentrations of methionine (>1000 \u03bcmol/L) during ICU admission in our patient, despite betaine having been stopped on admission. This could be attributed to disturbed methionine metabolism due to liver failure. Hypermethioninaemia encephalopathy may have been a contributing factor to patient's initial encephalopathy on ICU admission, in addition to hepatic encephalopathy. However, the encephalopathy resolved quickly despite persistently elevated plasma methionine (>1000 \u03bcmol/L). Neuroimaging to identify abnormalities associated with hypermethioninaemia encephalopathy was not done. Patients with inherited methylation disorders associated with elevated plasma methionine (glycine Nmethyltransferase deficiency, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase deficiency, adenosine kinase deficiency) have been reported to develop liver abnormalities with abnormal liver histology, transaminitis, hepatosteatosis, and fibrosis.26\u201328 Animal studies showed that excess methionine induces hepatoxicity by binding hepatic ATP to form S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine with subsequent hepatic ATP depletion. This also results in shift in hepatic reduced GSH to oxidised GSH with subsequent oxidative damage.29,30 The role of hypermethioninaemia in development of liver abnormalities in these disorders is uncertain.26,27 It is not clear whether hypermethioninaemia associated with CBS deficiency, protein-unrestricted diet and betaine therapy may have contributed to or precipitated liver damage caused by paracetamol toxicity in this patient. Paracetamol is a commonly used analgesic that is usually safe at doses used therapeutically. At high doses, it causes potentially fatal hepatotoxicity with associated centrilobular hepatic necrosis.31 Increased risk of toxicity occurs with advancing age, malnutrition, and acute high doses.32 Paracetamol is metabolised to N-acetyl-pbenzoquinone imine (NAPBQI) by cytochrome P-450. NAPBQI is detoxified at non-toxic doses by GSH into an acetaminophen-GSH conjugate. However, at toxic doses, hepatic GSH may be depleted by as much as 80%\u201390%,33 leading to covalent binding of NAPBQI to proteins in hepatocytes with subsequent hepatic necrosis.32 In addition, GSH depletion leads to increased oxidative stress due to decreased detoxification of ROS, with alteration in calcium metabolism, initiation of signal transduction responses and mitochondrial dysfunction. This further contributes to hepatic necrosis.31 We suggest that disturbed GSH metabolism and subsequent oxidative stress due to poorly controlled HCU in our patient predisposed them to hepatic toxicity from a conventionally therapeutic dose of paracetamol. This may have been exacerbated by recent weight loss during admission. NAC has long been used as an antidote in paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity by restoring hepatic concentrations of GSH, through increasing plasma concentrations of cysteine. In addition, it has antioxidant 242 ELKHATEEB ET AL. 21928312, 2023, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmd2.12363, Wiley Online Library on [26/07/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License effects which reduce oxidative stress implicated in paracetamol hepatotoxicity.22,34 Hcy is 70%\u201380% bound to albumin, with the other two non-albumin bound Hcy fractions being free reduced Hcy (1%\u20132%) and free oxidised Hcy (homocysteine, cysteine\u2013homocysteine disulphide) (10%\u201320%).35 Oral or iv administration of NAC was found to rapidly reduce the levels of plasma tHcy by replacing Hcy in its binding to albumin (thiol exchange reaction) leading to the formation of mixed low-molecular- weight cysteine and NAC disulfides with high renal clearance and possibly increased metabolic bioavailability, thus enhancing its renal clearance.36\u201339 In vivo and in vitro studies,36,37,40 have shown that NAC reduced tHcy by 20%\u201350% in a dose dependent fashion, while the free Hcy fraction was increased. Urinary excretion of total and free cysteine and Hcy was increased on NAC infusion.37 NAC supplementation in CBSdeficient mice was shown to reduce tHcy and increase total cysteine compared to controls. However, total cysteine levels were not fully corrected in mice.41 These reports support our observations that tHcy in our patient was markedly reduced during NAC intravenous treatment for paracetamol toxicity and has returned to untreated baseline after cessation of infusion. Although it is suggested that free Hcy generated from thiol exchange reactions will be eliminated by kidneys, the increase in free reduced Hcy may actually increase endothelial cell dysfunction,38,42 as plasma free Hcy may more accurately represent the in vivo biological activity of Hcy.42 Furthermore, NAC treatment in CBS-knockout mice model with hepatopathy decreased life span of pups, yet the CBS-knockout mice failed to respond to betaine or exhibit several important features of the human HCU disease, thus the results from the CBSknockout mice model should treated with caution.43 These observations may raise caution for the use of NAC as a potential long-term therapy in HCU. To our knowledge, no studies exist in literature that described the potential therapeutic effect of NAC in patients with HCU. A phase I\u2013II clinical cross-over, unblinded, clinical trial studying the effect of paracetamol and NAC on liver metabolism in adult patients with HCU has been registered but recruitment was suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic.43,44 A non-randomised open label, unblinded, clinical trial studying the effect of oral NAC in lowering homocysteine in individuals with HCU has been registered yet the results have not been deposited nor published in literature.44,45 This report has limitations due to lack of data on plasma cysteine, cystine concentrations, and GSH metabolites. Long-term monitoring of plasma tHcy and plasma amino acids on the patient's follow-up is planned as per the published HCU guidelines.1 In conclusion, we suggest that paracetamol should be administered cautiously in HCU patients because of assumed GSH depletion and risk of toxicity even at therapeutic doses. Other risk factors for liver injury could possibly include hypermethioninemia due to betaine treatment. NAC administration is clearly effective in lowering tHcy in HCU on the short-term, however further research is required to assess clinical efficacy and use as a potential therapy in HCU.

2012;9(10):10\u201312 LEVETIRACETAM-INDUCED ACUTE PSYCHOTIC EPISODE Dear Editor: Levetiracetam is known to cause behavioral side effects ranging from anxiety to agitation and hostile behavior. Even though psychotic symptoms were reported in initial trials,1 they are less common compared to behavioral symptoms. We report a case of 50-year-old man who presented with a first psychotic episode secondary to an increase in dose of levetiracetam. Case report. A 50-year old African-American man with no past psychiatric history was admitted to our medical floor with a first episode of psychosis. His medical history was significant for partial complex seizures since he was three years old, migraines, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). At initial evaluation, he was anxious, agitated, and was complaining of insects crawling all over his body and entering into his mouth, ears, and nose. He was distressed and was trying to pick these insects from his body. He complained of severe itching and was scratching himself. He said that he was able to see them and was asking to switch off the light to get rid of them. Medications on admission were levetiracetam 1000mg orally twice daily, gabapentin 600mg orally at bedtime, valproic acid 500mg orally twice daily, and esomeprazole 40mg orally once daily. The patient denied any recent medication changes, but his girlfriend reported that he had been taking an extra tablet of levetiracetam by mistake for about a week. There was no history of substance abuse or any recent head trauma. Physical examination was normal through out the hospital stay. Diagnostic workup included a complete blood cell count differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, blood alcohol level, urine analysis, urine drug screen, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, electroencephalography, and valproic acid and levetiracetam levels, which were all normal. Based on history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests, a diagnosis of levetiracetaminduced psychosis was made. Levetiracetam was stopped and olanzapine 5mg orally, as needed, every six hours, was started. The patient recovered from his psychotic symptoms over next 48 hours and was discharged home. Discussion. Levetiracetam is a water-soluble pyrrolidone derivative ((S) \u2013 alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidine acetamide) with a chemical structure different from other antiepileptic medications.2 Usual antiepileptic plasma concentration ranges from trough levels between 35 and 100mM (5.95\u201317mg/ml) to peak levels between 90 and 250 mM (15.3\u201342.5 mg/ml).3 Levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effects by specifically binding to a 90-kDa-membrane protein, which is restricted to neuronal cells. It also blocks zinc and beta-carbolines from interrupting chloride influx in the gamma-amino butyric acid and glycine receptors.4 The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved levetiracetam in 1999 as an adjuvant antiepileptic medication for partial seizures in adults. In long-term, open-labeled, follow-up studies, leverecitam demonstrated good seizure control5 and an improved quality of life in children, adolescentsand adults.6 Although it has generally a good side-effect profile, psychiatric side effects seen in up to 13.3 percent of adults and 37.6 percent of pediatric patients can be significant. Of these, severe symptoms such as depression, agitation, or hostility, and psychotic behavior are observed in 0.7 percent of patients.7 Even though psychotic symptoms are less commonly reported they result in considerable distress to patient and family members. In some situations psychiatric risks are significant enough for an inpatient assessment and treatment. In spite of the high prevalence of behavioral side effects, neurochemical changes causing this are yet to be scientifically explained. Some studies report that pre-existing psychiatric conditions may increase likely hood of behavioral side effects due to levetiracetam.8 In our case, based on the temporal sequence of events, medical evaluation, and negative diagnostic workup, the possibility of levetiracetam-induced psychosis was high. Complete resolution of his symptoms after stopping levetiracetam further supports the hypothesis of this case report. His levetiracetam level of 22 micrograms/mL, which was within normal range, suggest that severity of psychiatric symptoms may not correlate with plasma concentrations of levetiracetam.9 In conclusion, medication side effects resulting in psychiatric presentations are less frequent but challenging to clinicians. They are usually diagnosed after excluding all common medical causes. High comorbidity exists between epilepsy and psychiatric disorders,10 studies suggest that psychopathology is frequently unrecognized and is untreated in people with epilepsy.11 As a result, each case needs an Letters to the Editor Innov Clin Neurosci. 2012;9(10):10\u201312 individual consideration and a comprehensive evaluation in finding etiology. Evidence suggests that there is some correlation between levetiracetam and psychiatric side effects. Even though it is difficult to predict the side effects, knowledge of risk factors would guide clinicians to avoid use of levetiracetam in high-risk populations.

The case emphasizes the importance of recognizing toxic optic neuritis in patients on antitubercular therapy. Prompt recognition and treatment of such adverse drug reactions will reduce the associated morbidity. Keywords: antitubercular therapy; high-dose isoniazid; linezolid; toxic optic neuropathy. Introduction Toxic optic neuropathy (TON) is a medical disorder characterized by visual impairment due to toxin-induced optic nerve damage. The common causes implicated in the TON are drug toxicity [ethambutol, isoniazid (INH), and amiodarone], methanol poisoning, tobacco-alcohol amblyopia, and nutritional deficiencies (vitamin B complex). It is characterized by bilateral painless progressive diminution of vision with optic disc pallor and dyschromatopsia, impairment in color vision [1]. We report a case of a 26-year-old male patient diagnosed with extensively drugresistant pulmonary tuberculosis (XDR-TB) presenting with reversible bilateral TON induced by the use of linezolid along with high-dose INH. Case report A 26-year-old male patient presented with complaints of painless diminishing of vision in both eyes and numbness in the lower limb since the past 15 days. Medical history revealed that the patient was diagnosed with XDR tuberculosis and has been receiving antitubercular therapy comprising of INH (900 mg/day), moxifloxacin (400 mg/day), linezolid (600 mg/day), clofazimine (200 mg/day), para-aminosalicylate (12 g/day), amoxyclav (1 g/day), capreomycin (1 g/day), and pyridoxine (10 mg/day) for the past 5 months. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 3/60 in the right eye and 2/60 in the left eye. Ishihara color plates showed decreased color vision (0 of 15 plates) in both eyes. Pupils were normal size and normal reaction (NSNR). The anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed optic disc edema and blurring of disc margins in both eyes. The patient was not able to perform a reliable Humphrey visual field examination. Neurological examination was unremarkable. MRI of brain and investigations for connective tissue disorders did not show any specific cause for optic neuritis. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral TON probably due to long-term treatment with linezolid, high-dose INH, or capreomycin. Linezolid and high-dose INH were immediately stopped and replaced with clarithromycin (1 g/day). The vision started improving in few days after discontinuation of linezolid and INH, and visual acuity was restored to 6/6 in both eyes by the end of 1 month. The color vision was also significantly improved (10 of 15 plates) in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed mark reduction in the optic disc pallor in both eyes. The patient has been stable for more than 6 months since discontinuation of these drugs. Causality analysis was done using the World Health Organization Uppsala Monitoring Center (WHO-UMC) system for the assessment of the adverse drug reactions, and the causality categories showed probable (likely) association for linezolid and possible for INH [2]. *Corresponding author: Proteesh Rana, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Department of Pharmacology, New Delhi, India, E-mail: proteesh@gmail.com Vandana Roy and Jamshed Ahmad: Maulana Azad Medical College, Department of Pharmacology, New Delhi, India Brought to you by | G\u00f6teborg University - University of Gothenburg Authenticated Download Date | 10/14/18 9:51 AM 2 Rana et al.: Drug-induced optic neuropathy in a case of extensively drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis Further, as per the Naranjo algorithm, the event has a score of 5, which is a probable adverse drug reaction [3]. The adverse effect was reported to the Pharmacovigilance Programme of India with adverse drug reaction report no. MAMC Feb-2016/042 and worldwide unique no. IN-IPC- 2016-09468 Supplementary material. Discussion The patient received both the drugs linezolid and highdose INH, which are implicated in causing optic neuritis. Linezolid is the first member of a new class of synthetic antimicrobials known as oxazolidinones. It acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and is used as a reserved antimicrobial for treatment of serious infections caused by resistant gram-positive bacteria, especially methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [4]. It is also a second-line antitubercular drug, and WHO has classified it as a drug with unclear efficacy for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis MDR-TB and XDR-TB [5]. Linezolid is well tolerated with few gastrointestinal side effects and occasional reports of rash, pruritis, headache, and oral candidiasis [4]. The safety of linezolid is established only up to 4 weeks. Optic neuropathy has been reported after linezolid use beyond 4 weeks. It is therefore critical that all the patients receiving linezolid for more than 4 weeks must be screened for visual complaints. The exact cause of linezolid-induced optic neuropathy is not known, but optic nerve mitochondrial dysfunction is being implicated [6]. INH is a first-line antitubercular drug. High-dose INH is classified by the WHO as a drug with unclear efficacy, which can be used in XDR-TB showing low level of INH resistance [5]. The most important side effects of INH are neurological manifestations such as peripheral neuritis, parasthesia, numbness, and mental disturbance. These side effects of INH will be more pronounced at higher dose but can be prevented by giving pyridoxine (10 mg/day) [7]. Many antitubercular drugs like INH [8], ethambutol [9], streptomycin [10], capreomycin [11], and linezolid [12] are associated with optic neuropathy. The patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR) may be administered these drugs concurrently; therefore, more caution is advised while selecting an antitubercular regime for such patients. Moreover, such patients must be regularly monitored for any visual adverse effects. The early recognition of drug-induced optic neuropathy and immediate stoppage may enable full visual recovery in these patients.

The reason for its current prevalence remains unclear as the medical literature is scarce on the condition in children. In this study, we describe the case of a 17-year-old girl suffering from chronic, position-dependent epigastric pain. The symptoms were observed during post-meal activity, with a significant increase in pain intensity while in an upright position. An inferior stomach displacement was noted in an upper gastrointestinal X-ray study using barium. Keywords: gastroptosis; Glenard\u2019s disease; abdominal pain 1. Introduction Chronic abdominal pain in children is common, with up to a third of elementary students reporting abdominal pain weekly [1,2]. Functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia, are the most common causes of chronic abdominal pain [1]. Other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease or allergic gut disorders, may also be the cause of such complaints. Gastroptosis is a disorder with a downward displacement of the stomach, where its greater curve is dislocated below the level of the iliac crest. The diagnosis can be made with the use of imaging studies of the abdomen in an upright position [1]. Epigastric pain, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, loss of appetite, or even gastric emptying disorders can be caused by gastroptosis. Symptoms are usually exacerbated during postprandial activity and differential di\u0002agnosis usually includes gastritis, pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer disease [1,2]. However, certain anatomic conditions, such as congenital stenosis of the duodenum and intestines, annular pancreas, pancreatic tumors, or intestinal malrotation, should also be considered. This would also include Crohn\u2019s disease affecting the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gas\u0002troesophageal reflux disease (GERD), food allergies, or psychosomatic disorders [3]. The symptoms caused by gastroptosis can impact the quality of life due to their postprandial character, which can disrupt daily activities [3,4]. 2. Case Presentation A 17-year-old female patient was admitted to the Children\u2019s Gastroenterology Division for a planned diagnostic stay due to chronic abdominal pain. 2.1. Family History Her family history was uneventful. The child was born of a single pregnancy, natural childbirth at 38th week of gestation with a birth weight of 2850 g. She was breastfed until the first month of age and her development was harmonious. Children 2023, 10, 116. https://doi.org/10.3390/children10010116 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/children Children 2023, 10, 116 2 of 6 2.2. Medical History At five years of age, the patient contracted varicella. She was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease at 16 after exhibiting symptoms of hyperthyroidism: exophthalmos and hyperhidro\u0002sis. The diagnosis was confirmed in laboratory testing with a TSH level < 0.005 \u00b5IU/mL (N 0.27\u20134.2 \u00b5IU/mL), fT4 2.54 ng/dL (N 0.93\u20131.7 ng/dL), and TRAb 6.96 IU/L (N 0.3\u20131.58 IU/L). Her body weight was 50 kg (10\u201325 percentile) with a height of 165 cm (50th percentile) resulting in a BMI of 18.4 kg/m2 (10th percentile) when the diagnosis was made. She subsequently underwent thiamazole therapy which resulted in a state of euthyreosis and withdrawal of the aforementioned symptoms. The patient remained under the care of an allergist due to atopic dermatitis and an allergic response to numerous inhalatory allergens. An allergic reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed. 2.3. Symptoms The onset of her symptoms occurred two years prior in a gradually increasing manner. The patient\u2019s chief complaint was epigastric pain which was exacerbated after meals. There appeared to be a significant increase in its intensity in the upright position. The patient had no prior history of diarrhea or constipation. Under the care of her general practitioner (GP) she underwent basic laboratory tests with no significant findings, and an additional abdominal ultrasound found no abnormalities. However, a noteworthy weight loss was observed, with the patient losing 6 kg in body weight over the course of the last 6 months before admission. This may have been due to a change of eating habits and a new diet with increased dietary fiber consumption. The patient underwent regular thyroid screening and maintained a state of euthyreosis. Prior to admission, a gastroscopy was performed on an outpatient basis. Both endoscopic and microscopic examinations revealed a normal image of the stomach and duodenal mucosa. 2.4. Physical Examination, Laboratory Tests\u2019 Results and Imaging Studies Notable clinical findings on admission included significant decrease in body weight of 44 kg resulting in a BMI of 16 kg/m2 (both below the third percentile) and scoliosis. Laboratory tests on admission did not reveal any abnormalities with a TSH of 4.2 \u00b5IU/mL (N 0.27\u20134.2 \u00b5IU/mL), fT4 1.06 ng/dL (N 0.93\u20131.7 ng/dL), total IgA 1.13 g/L (N 0.61\u20133.48), and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies IgA 1.38 RU/mL (N < 20 RU/mL). Fecal calprotectin (FC) levels were also normal (<100 \u00b5g/g, N < 100 \u00b5g/g), which ruled out inflammatory bowel disease with a high degree of probability. Initial imaging studies, which included an abdominal ultrasound and a chest X-ray, did not reveal significant abnormalities other than the aforementioned scoliosis. During hospitalization, any eating disorders were excluded after an assessment by a trained clinical psychologist. However, it was noted that the patient exhibited symptoms that were indicative of depression and further psychological care was recommended. As a result of initial diagnostics being inconclusive, an upper GI X-ray study using barium was performed, revealing a downward displacement of the stomach. In the standing position, the organ was located entirely under the diaphragm and extended all the way to the pelvic cavity (Figures 1 and 2). During the procedure gastric emptying abnormalities were also observed, with no barium reaching the duodenum. However, in the supine position, contrast medium flow was unimpeded with both the duodenum and small intestine seemingly devoid of pathologies (Figure 3). 2.5. Diagnosis and Treatment Considering the patient\u2019s symptoms and imaging studies\u2019 results, she was diagnosed with gastroptosis accompanied by abnormal gastric emptying exacerbated by weight loss. Since the patient had a prolonged QTc interval, cisapride therapy was ruled out and itopride was used instead. An adequate meal plan was suggested, aiming for weight gain, split into 5 meals eaten slowly. The patient was released home but remained in outpatient care.

Follow\u2010Up The patient was once again admitted to the hospital 6 months after initial discharge home due to a recurrence of weight loss and epigastric pain. On admission, her weight was 36.7 kg (<3 percentile), and with a height of 165.9 cm (50th percentile) her BMI was 13.3 kg/m2 (<3 percentile). Furthermore, amenorrhea was observed. An extensive labora\u2010 tory testing panelrevealed signs of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with a low estradiol level, elevated cortisol, and hyperprolactinemia. A thorough psychiatric assessment of patient resulted in the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN). Psychotherapy and anti\u2010de\u2010 pression treatment were implemented alongside a high\u2010calorie diet and a resting lifestyle. However, epigastric pain still persisted even after a weight gain of 4.2 kg. Further inves\u2010 tigation of the patient revealed that she had not been taking the prescribed prokinetic drugs. She currently remains in outpatient care with a stable weight. 3. Discussion Visceroptosis, the displacement of abdominal organs below their natural position is also known as Glenard\u2019s disease. When the stomach is affected, the disease is referred to as gastroptosis. Gastroptosis is diagnosed when the stomach is observed to be displaced downwards, with its greater curve being partly projected below the level of the iliac crest, whilst the antrum remains in its usual position [1]. The first report of gastroptosis was Figure 3. Efficient barium contrast emptying in supine position. The duodenum and intestines are devoid of pathologies. 2.6. Follow-Up The patient was once again admitted to the hospital 6 months after initial discharge home due to a recurrence of weight loss and epigastric pain.

Psychotherapy and anti-depression treatment were implemented alongside a high-calorie diet and a resting lifestyle. However, epigastric pain still persisted even after a weight gain of 4.2 kg. Further investigation of the patient revealed that she had not been taking the prescribed prokinetic drugs. She currently remains in outpatient care with a stable weight. 3. Discussion Visceroptosis, the displacement of abdominal organs below their natural position is also known as Glenard\u2019s disease. When the stomach is affected, the disease is referred to as gastroptosis. Gastroptosis is diagnosed when the stomach is observed to be displaced downwards, with its greater curve being partly projected below the level of the iliac crest, whilst the antrum remains in its usual position [1]. The first report of gastroptosis was published by Glenard in 1833. Since then, only a handful of cases were reported in the medical literature. Available data to date shows that gastroptosis mostly affects women between 20 and 50 years of age, with risk factors of low weight and postural defects being noted [4\u20139]. It is most likely caused by excessive laxity of the abdominal wall, with the mesenteric attachments of the stomach becoming too thin and relaxed under the organ\u2019s weight. Additionally, a decreased amount of visceral fat within the lesser omentum is another predisposing factor [3,6]. Although gastroptosis has no specific symptoms, the most common manifestations of this condition have been noted to include epigastric pain or discomfort, nausea, emetic episodes, early satiety, and flatulence, which are all exacerbated Children 2023, 10, 116 5 of 6 in the standing position and during post-meal activity [2,6,9,10]. Other rare complications, such as abdominal circumference enlargement, ileus, and femoral hernia, have also been recorded [9,11]. Kusano et al. suggests that patients suffering from gastroptosis are less prone to dyspepsia [8]. However, such findings have not been reported in western populations. Upper GI tract fluoroscopy alongside oral barium or iodine-based contrast remains the main diagnostic tool, with additional high-resolution sequential X-rays in the standing position further helping diagnosis [1,2,4]. Gastroptosis is diagnosed when the stomach is displaced downwards, with its greater curve being partly projected below the level of the iliac crest. The antrum remains in its usual position [1]. As exemplified by our case, the condition is often accompanied by gastric emptying disorders, known as gastroparesis [4,12]. In children, the most common causes of gastroparesis include diabetes, viral infections, hypothyroidism, muscular dystrophy, and immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract in preterm babies [13,14]. Laboratory or endoscopic findings are not enough for the identification of gastroparesis. Differential diagnosis should include GERD, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and various disorders of the pancreas and gallbladder. Furthermore, gastric emptying disorders may accompany gastroptosis, and for that reason, bowel obstruction should be also taken under consideration. In our case, the patient did experience early satiety. In Glenard\u2019s times, the usual approach was to perform surgery [15]. Nowadays, invasive treatment is reserved to a handful of cases complicated by bowel obstruction [4,10,16,17]. Contemporary treatment includes prokinetic drugs and an adequate diet. Physiotherapy focused on abdominal and paraspinal muscles\u2019 strengthening also plays an important role. At times, special abdominal bands are used [2,10,16,17]. 4. Summary and Conclusions Although our patient\u2019s medical history revealed risk factors for gastroptosis, including female sex, weight deficiency, and a postural defect (scoliosis), diagnosis of gastroptosis was prolonged due to weight loss not being reported in the current medical literature. As such, the aforementioned weight loss was seen to be one of the causing factors for gastroptosis in the described case. The diagnosis was made furthermore difficult due to the patient\u2019s medical history which included hyperthyroidism (Graves-Basedow disease) and depression. She was also diagnosed with anorexia nervosa a few months later during her second hospital stay. Gastroptosis was confirmed in an upper GI tract X-ray using barium. As the aforementioned diagnostic method is both easily available and interpreted, it should be considered as an imaging modality when gastroptosis is suspected. It is the authors suggestion that gastroptosis and secondary gastrointestinal tract motility disorders should be taken into consideration when diagnosing non-specific dyspeptic symptoms in children.

Dysfunction of TIVAP is not uncommon in clinical practice in cases of several etiologies. Herein, we report a rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to a catheter that migrated into the pleural space. Case presentation: We present a case of a 70-year-old man of TIVAP dysfunction due to a rare catheter extra-vascular migration into the pleural space, diagnosed by computed tomography. We decided on observation without further utilization of the TIVAP and a shift to oral chemotherapy, after a discussion with patient and his primary care oncologist. Conclusion: Our case highlighted the importance of proper evaluation of TIVAP catheter location before its usage or replacement. INTRODUCTION The totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is widely used as a reliable route for chemotherapy, transfusions or parenteral nutrition support. Dysfunction is one of the most frequent compli\u0002cations of TIVAP. The etiologies described in the literature include venous thrombosis around the catheter, catheter obstruction, catheter disruption or dislocation [1]. Herein, we report the rare case of TIVAP dysfunction due to catheter migration into the pleural space. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old man presented to the vascular surgical outpatient clinic with TIVAP dysfunction. He received TIVAP (8-Fr Polysite sil\u0002icone catheter in 2018, Perouse Medical, Ivry-Le-Temple, France.) implantation more than 3 years ago. He had received monthly 80 mg intravenous docetaxel treatment for left lung squamous cell carcinoma after the TIVAP implantation. As patient\u2019s state\u0002ment, he has dry cough before diagnosed of lung squamous cell carcinoma and persistent during the course of chemotherapy. Obstruction of the device occurred during blood aspiration though a smooth intravenous push was reported by nursing staff in the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Neck and facial f lush and mild dyspnea had developed hours after infusion of chemotherapeutic agents in the past 6 months. On examination, the port was well fixed, with a fair depth of puncture. Migration of the catheter tip was found by plain film check-up (Fig. 1, arrowhead), compared with the image obtained 6 months ago. Chest computed tomogra\u0002phy revealed that the catheter migrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space (Fig. 2, arrowhead). Catheter removal with SVC repair via sternotomy or endovascular stent graft coverage with adequate pericardial drainage was advised, Figure 1. Migration of the catheter tip (arrowhead). but the patient chose conservative treatment for the migrated device. Oral Vinorelbine 100 mg twice per month was initiated after a discussion with the primary care oncologist. This helped keep the patient in asymptomatic and tumor recurrence-free status during the 1-year follow-up. DISCUSSION The totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is widely used for chemotherapy, transfusions and parenteral nutrition. The inci\u0002dence of TIVAP malfunction ranges from 0.67 to 3.7% [2\u20136]. Eti\u0002ology includes intra-catheter thrombosis or precipitation, fibrin sheath formation or venous thrombosis around the catheter, Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/omcr/article/2023/5/omad044/7186223 by guest on 21 July 2023 180 | Oxford Medical Case Reports, 2023, Vol. 10, No. 5 Figure 2. The catheter migrated through the SVC into the pleural space (arrowhead). catheter kinking, pinch-off syndrome and catheter migration [7]. The incidence of spontaneous catheter migration ranges from 0.4 to 2% based on a review of the available literature [1, 6, 8, 9]. In this case, the migrated catheter penetrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space, which is a rare clinical situation. We postulate that the mechanism of catheter migration may be related to an elevated intra-thoracic cavity due to cough, which is especially frequent in patients with lung cancer, as described by Wu et al. [8]. Shallow catheter tip location, which is defined as a catheter tip located above the lower third of SVC, and lung cancer were assumed to be risk factors for catheter migration [8, 9]. Here, the migrated catheter tip was directed towards the post-chemotherapy fibrotic SVC wall, with a combination of radial force caused by the angulating catheter itself, and the kinetic movement of the heartbeat resulting in penetration of the vessel wall into pleural space. Chou et al. reported a case of innominate vein penetration into the pleural space by a left-sided silicone TIVAP catheter 4 months after implantation [10]. The patient had left-side massive pleural effusion after f luid infusion via TIVAP. In our patient, the catheter migrated into the right pleural space via the pericardial space, as shown by CT, which would explain his discomfort after chemotherapy. Over-the-wire catheter exchange or direct catheter removal are the treatment choice for the obstructed TIVAP. However, any intervention affecting the dysfunctional catheter, including removal or exchange may lead to possible lethal hemothorax or hemopericardium without proper closure of the chronic tract, which had been reported in previous reports [11, 12]. Leaving the TIVAP without further utilization did not cause any adverse effect; therefore, this option was also provided. After understanding the treatment options, their risks and benefits, and considering his preferences, goals and beliefs, he did not want to undergo more invasive interventions, due to his old age and advanced cancer status. This decision was made according to the current shared decision making procedure. In conclusion, extra-vascular migration of the catheter is a rare but important etiology of TIVAP malfunction. Physicians and surgeons should be aware of this risk when inserting a TIVAP as well as the way to prevent it, i.e. catheter tip check before usage or replacement.

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/omcr/article/2023/5/omad044/7186223 by guest on 21 July 2023  This case was detected in the medical literature by the EMA MLM Service from Wong CY, Yang HT, Hsin CH. Migration of silicone catheter into pleural space: a case report. Oxford Medical Case Reports. 2023;2023(5):179-81 on 21 Jun 2023. The spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Taiwan and concerns a 70-year-old male patient who experienced non-serious adverse reactions of neck and facial flush and mild dyspnea due associated with docetaxel. The patient presented to the vascular surgical outpatient clinic with TIVAP dysfunction. The patient received TIVAP (8-Fr Polysite silicone catheter in 2018, Perouse Medical, Ivry-Le-Temple, France.) implantation more than 3 years ago. The patient had received monthly 80 mg intravenous docetaxel treatment for left lung squamous cell carcinoma after the TIVAP implantation. As patient\u2019s statement, he has had dry cough before diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma and persistence during the course of chemotherapy. Obstruction of the device occurred during blood aspiration though a smooth intravenous push was reported by nursing staff in the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Neck and facial flush and mild dyspnea had developed hours after infusion of chemotherapeutic agents in the past 6 months. On examination, the port was well fixed, with a fair depth of puncture. Migration of the catheter tip was found by plain film check-up, compared with the image obtained 6 months ago. Chest computed tomography revealed that the catheter migrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space. Catheter removal with SVC repair via sternotomy or endovascular stent graft coverage with adequate pericardial drainage was advised, but the patient chose conservative treatment for the migrated device. Oral Vinorelbine 100 mg twice per month was initiated after a discussion with the primary care oncologist. This helped keep the patient in asymptomatic and tumor recurrence-free status during the 1-year follow-up. In this case, the migrated catheter penetrated through the superior vena cava (SVC) into the pleural space, which is a rare clinical situation. Author postulated that the mechanism of catheter migration may be related to an elevated intra-thoracic cavity due to cough, which is especially frequent in patients with lung cancer. In this patient, the catheter migrated into the right pleural space via the pericardial space, as shown by CT, which would explain his discomfort after chemotherapy. This case was considered valid post receipt of authors response on 21-Jun-2023. The author stated \u201cDue to his abnormal catheter tip into pleural space, we thought his neck and facial flush and mild dyspnea is related to extraordinary high concentration of docetaxel infiltrated to pleural and mediastinal space, instead of the therapeutic concentration if injected properly into central vein\u201d. Follow-up information has been requested. Follow-up received on 02 Jul 2023: Additional information added following the receipt of author response. The patient was overweight during the evaluation. The patient reported dyspnea, neck and facial flushing approximately 1 to 2 hours after the infusion of docetaxel. The authors believe that the adverse reactions were related to the focally high concentration of docetaxel at the pleural and mediastinal space instead of the hypersensitivity or allergic reaction. The patient reported ex-smoker status, social drinking, and no recreational drug usage.

Email: ihlee@cu.ac.kr. Background: Chylothorax is a state in which pleurisy is induced by chylomicron leakage due to lymphatic  injury. Membranous nephropathy (MN) is one of the relatively common glomerular diseases that cause  nephrotic syndrome in adults. Chylothorax at the onset of nephrotic syndrome is very rare in adult patients. Case Description: We report a case of chylothorax associated with primary MN. A 64-year-old man  visited the hospital complaining of lower extremity edema and dyspnea for 4 weeks. Laboratory findings  showed no azotemia but hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, nephrotic-range proteinuria, and  microscopic hematuria. Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed no ascites, venous  thrombosis, or malignancy with the presence of right-side pleurisy. Biochemical analysis of the pleural  fluid was consistent with chylothorax. The patient was confirmed to have MN by percutaneous kidney  biopsy. An angiotensin receptor blocker, diuretics, and a hypolipidemic agent were prescribed; non-per os,  total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and subcutaneous injection of octreotide were added for management  of chylothorax. As serum anti-phospholipase receptor 2 antibody (Ab) concentration increased again,  immunosuppressive therapy (IST) consisting of alternating monthly cycles of glucocorticoids and oral  cyclophosphamide was instituted. With no improvement in chylothorax and deteriorating nutritional  status despite 3 weeks of medical therapy, lymphangiography was performed, followed by thoracic duct  embolization (TDE). The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 53 with clinical improvement. At  9 months after discharge, clinical remission of primary MN was achieved without recurrence of chylothorax. Conclusions: Patients with nephrotic syndrome may rarely exhibit refractory chylothorax without chylous  ascites, increasing the risk of serious metabolic complications such as severe malnutrition. Therefore, upon  confirming chylothorax associated with primary nephrotic syndrome, prompt radiologic intervention for  lymphatic leakage must be considered in addition to specific IST.

MN with chylothorax \u00a9 Annals of Palliative Medicine. All rights reserved. Ann Palliat Med 2023 | https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-23-101 Introduction Chylothorax is a condition in which milky chyle composed  of fat particles is released into and accumulates in the  pleural cavity due to damage to the lymphatic system,  including the thoracic duct. It is associated with a variety  of causes, including trauma, cardio-thoracic surgery,  malignancy, congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis,  infections, and lymphatic disorders (1). However, due  to its rarity, nephrotic syndrome is not well recognized  as the cause of chylothorax. Nephrotic syndrome is a  clinical syndrome characterized by high-grade proteinuria,  generalized edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and  hypercoagulability (2). Membranous nephropathy (MN)  is a common glomerular disease that causes nephrotic  syndrome in non-diabetic adults (3). In patients with  nephrotic syndrome, the occurrence of chylothorax and/or  chyloascites is rare in adults compared to children. Cases  of chylothorax associated with nephrotic syndrome in adult  patients have rarely been reported since the first description  in 1968 (4-12). Therefore, we report a case of primary  MN presenting with right-side chylothorax in a patient  with bilateral leg edema, along with a literature review. We  present this case in accordance with the CARE reporting  checklist (available at https://apm.amegroups.com/article/ view/10.21037/apm-23-101/rc). Case presentation A 64-year-old male patient visited the nephrology clinic  complaining of bilateral lower extremity edema and  dyspnea. The patient had developed edema in both lower  extremities 4 weeks prior, which progressed gradually.  Shortness of breath during exercise started 2 weeks prior,  but there were no complaints of cough, sputum, or chest  pain at the time of presentation. He had been taking an  angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan, 16 mg/day)  for hypertension, which was diagnosed 6 months before  admission. There was no history of diabetes mellitus,  chronic liver disease, heart failure, or chest trauma. At the  time of admission, vital signs showed a blood pressure of  122/62 mmHg, a pulse of 65 beats/min, a respiration rate  of 20 breaths/min, and a body temperature of 36.6 \u2103.  Physical examination revealed decreased breathing sounds  in the right chest as well as moderate pitting edema in the  pretibial region of both lower legs. Table 1 shows the results  of peripheral blood examinations and serum biochemistry  tests at the time of admission. Serum blood urea nitrogen,  creatinine (Cr), and estimated glomerular filtration rates  were 13.8 mg/dL, 0.8 mg/dL, and 93 mL/min/1.73 m2 ,  respectively. Hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia,  proteinuria, and microscopic hematuria were noted. On  a 24-hour urine study, urinary protein excretion was  4,419 mg/day, and the Cr clearance was 101.7 mL/min.  Serological markers, such as Venereal Disease Research  Laboratory, hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C  antibody (Ab), anti-human immunodeficiency virus Ab,  anti-nuclear Ab, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab, and  rheumatoid factor, were all negative. Right-side pleurisy was  noted on chest computed tomography (CT) (Figure 1A,1B).  On abdominal CT, both kidneys appeared unremarkable,  with no evidence of ascites, vascular thrombosis,  lymphadenopathy, or malignancy (Figure 1C,1D). The  pleural fluid aspirated from the thoracentesis was yellowish  and milky in appearance (Figure 2), and drainage was  maintained after percutaneous catheterization. Pleural  fluid analysis led to a diagnosis of lymphocyte-dominant  transudate based on the pH of 7.23, 3,200/\u03bcL white blood  cells (lymphocytes, 95%), pleural fluid-serum protein  ratio of 0.35 (1.7/4.8), and pleural fluid-serum lactate  dehydrogenase ratio of 0.36 (62/174) (Tables 1,2). Also,  biochemical analysis results of the pleural fluid were  consistent with the diagnostic criteria of chylothorax (13).  The pleural fluid microbiologic results, including bacterial  and fungal cultures, acid-fast bacilli smear, and polymerase  chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were all  negative. Pleural biopsy was not performed. The patient  underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy on the third hospital  Highlight box Key findings \u2022 We report a case of primary membranous nephropathy presenting  with chylothorax that was successfully treated with thoracic duct  embolization along with immunosuppressive therapy. What is known and what is new? \u2022 Chylothorax associated with primary nephrotic syndrome has been  reported rarely in adult patients. \u2022 In chylothorax associated with nephrotic syndrome, prompt  radiologic intervention for lymphatic leakage should be considered  if initial medical therapy is ineffective. What is the implication, and what should change now? \u2022 This case may help design a therapeutic approach for isolated  chylothorax associated with nephrotic syndrome. Further  investigations are needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism  of chylothorax in patients with primary nephrotic syndrome.

A total of 34 glomeruli was identified under a light  microscope. No intra-glomerular cell proliferation or  abnormalities were observed except for thickening of the  glomerular capillary wall (Figure 3A,3B).  Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed immune  deposition to immunoglobulin G (2+), complement 3 (1+),  kappa (1+), and lambda (1+) in the glomerular basement  membrane (GBM) (Figure 3C). Multiple subepithelial  electron-dense deposits were noted with diffuse foot  process effacement on electron microscopy (Figure 3D).  Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with  nephrotic syndrome due to MN. The serum concentration  of M (muscle)-type anti-phospholipase A2 receptor  (anti-PLA2R) Ab was 10.4 RU/mL, which was normal  (reference value, <14 RU/mL). The results of serum tumor  marker and stool occult blood tests performed to evaluate  secondary causes of MN were all negative (Table 1). On day  five, medical treatment for chylothorax was initiated while  maintaining the pleurisy tube by stopping enteral feeding,  starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and performing  a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg of octreotide every  8 hours. Administration of an angiotensin receptor blocker  was maintained as a conservative treatment for MN. After  that, the chylous pleurisy gradually turned white, and the  amount of drainage was appreciably reduced. On day 14,  dyspnea and peripheral edema resolved. Concurrently,  the serum albumin level was 2.3 g/dL, and the spot urine  protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) was 2.68. However, on  day 25, after non-per os for 3 weeks, the amount of chylous  effusion increased again when enteral nutrition of a low\u0002fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides was  resumed. The patient\u2019s anti-PLA2R Ab titer in serum also  increased (50.8 RU/mL). On day 30, we instituted specific  immunosuppressive therapy (IST) based on the modified  Ponticelli regimen for treatment of primary MN. In other  words, oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg) was administered daily  after an intravenous infusion of 1.0 g of methylprednisolone  for three consecutive days. The administration of octreotide  was discontinued after 1 month due to frequent diarrhea.  Dietary modification could no longer be continued due  to the marked deterioration of nutritional status and the  patient\u2019s poor tolerance. On day 37, the patient was referred  to the radiology department and underwent percutaneous  lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization (TDE);  lymphangiography was performed by approaching the left  inguinal node under ultrasound guidance. The cysterna  chyli was punctured to access thoracic duct, and lymphatic  leakage was confirmed in the thoracic duct and its tributaries  near the mediastinum. TDE was performed after injecting  histoacryl glue (1 lipiodol:2 n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate) under  fluoroscopic guidance (14). This procedure significantly  reduced chylous drainage from the thoracic cavity, and  the right pleurisy on chest X-ray showed remarkable  improvement (Figure 4A,4B).

Ann Palliat Med 2023 | https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-23-101 consent according to the institutional review board of  Daegu Catholic University Medical Center (No. CR-22- 070-PRO-001-R). Discussion MN is characterized by histopathologic renal injury in  which the glomerular capillary wall thickens with little or  no intra-glomerular cell proliferation or infiltration. It is a  glomerular nephropathy that causes nephrotic syndrome  in which immune deposits gradually accumulate in the  subepithelial space of the GBM, as seen under an electron  microscope, eventually resulting in damage to podocytes (3).  Primary MN, which accounts for the majority of MN, is an  isolated kidney disease caused by autoantibodies specific to  endogenous podocyte antigens without an identifiable cause.  In particular, the M-type PLA2R is a major target antigen  found in about 70\u201380% of patients with primary MN (3,15).  There were no specific abnormalities in serological markers  or imaging tests to suggest secondary MN in this patient,  but serum anti-PLA2R Ab was negative at the time of  admission. Therefore, a kidney biopsy was performed, and  nephrotic syndrome due to MN was diagnosed. However,  with the persistence of clinical findings indicating nephrotic  syndrome and chylothorax, the serum anti-PLA2R Ab  titer was elevated to serologic positivity 4 weeks after  hospitalization. The patient was diagnosed with PLA2R-associated MN  with immunologic progression and was started on combined  IST. Recent studies indicate that serum anti-PLA2 R Ab may  appear during the course of follow-up evaluations, even if it  is initially absent at the onset of MN (15). The reappearance  and/or elevation of circulating anti-PLA2R Abs, which were  previously negative or present at a lower titer, is a robust  predictor of an impending relapse of MN (16). Chylothorax is a clinical syndrome in which chyle leaks  from the thoracic or lymphatic ducts and accumulates in  the pleural space. After thoracentesis, if the presence of  chylomicrons is confirmed through Sudan III staining  of the pleural fluid or lipoprotein analysis, a diagnosis of  chylothorax can be made (1). If such a test is not available,  the lipid concentration in the pleural fluid is directly  measured, and if triglyceride concentration is greater than  110 mg/dL (1.24 mmol/L) and cholesterol concentration  is less than 200 mg/dL (5.18 mmol/L), a biochemical  diagnosis of chylothorax can be made (1,16). In this case,  the first drained pleural fluid after thoracentesis was milky  in color, and the concentrations of pleural triglycerides and  pleural cholesterol were 274 and 53 mg/dL, respectively. In  addition, the pleural fluid-to-serum concentration ratio of  triglyceride and cholesterol in this patient was greater than  1 (274/138) and less than 1 (53/260), respectively (Table 2).  All these biochemical findings were consistent with  chylothorax (17). The pathogenesis of chylothorax associated with  nephrotic syndrome remains unclear; it is explained by the  following hypothesis. In patients with nephrotic syndrome,  bowel edema is induced by severe hypoalbuminemia,  which increases the permeability of lymphatic vessels in the  intestinal mucosa or serosa. This progresses to chylomicron  leakage from the lymphatics or thoracic duct and the  development of chyloascites. Chylous fluid accumulation  in the peritoneal cavity causes unidirectional migration  of chyle into the pleural space through diaphragmatic  lymphatic vessels or diaphragmatic defects due to negative  intrathoracic pressure during inspiration (5). Additionally, in  patients with nephrotic syndrome, a hypercoagulable state  is often induced by loss of anti-thrombin III through the  urine and activation of the blood coagulation pathway (2).  At this time, thrombosis may occur in the superior vena  cava or subclavian vein, and the centripetal movement of  the chyle from the thoracic duct may be impeded, resulting  in chylothorax (18). When chylothorax is isolated without  concomitant chyloascites in a patient with nephrotic  syndrome, thrombosis in the thoracic vein or superior vena  cava should be investigated as the primary cause (19). A  decrease in anti-thrombin III and an increase in D-dimer  were found in the serum of this patient with chylothorax  alone. However, no evidence suggestive of thoracic duct  obstruction or thrombosis of the arteries or veins within the  thorax was found on chest CT. A total of nine cases of chylothorax has been reported  since the first description of the condition in 1968 in adults  (aged \u226518 years) with nephrotic syndrome (Table 2). An  analysis of these nine cases found a male-to-female ratio  of 1.25:1, and the average age at the time of diagnosis  was 42.7 years (range, 27\u201367 years). MN was the most  common cause of nephrotic syndrome, as witnessed in  5 cases (55.6%). In four cases, nephrotic syndrome and  chylothorax appeared simultaneously (4,9-11), but there  also have been cases where chylothorax was found 1 month  or 5 years after onset of nephrotic syndrome (7,12).

Chylothorax  frequently occurred on the right side (six cases), but  bilateral chylothorax was reported in two cases. The  average concentration of triglycerides in the pleural  fluid was 174.7 mg/dL (range, 97\u2013264 mg/dL), which  met the diagnostic criteria of chylothorax (>110 mg/dL)  in six cases (Table 2). Our patient was a 64-year-old male  with nephrotic syndrome due to primary MN. The  serum albumin concentration (2.3 g/dL) at the time of  chylothorax presentation was higher than the average  (1.5 g/dL) of previously reported cases. In this patient,  isolated chylothorax without chyloascites occurred, which  was not consistent with the clinical manifestations of most  of the previous cases. Correction of underlying disease is a first-line treatment  for chylothorax. In addition, supportive therapy for  metabolic complications, such as malnutrition, electrolyte  imbalance, and immune suppression due to continued  loss of chylous fluid, has been suggested (17). Surgical  therapy is recommended if chylous drainage is more than  1.5 L/day, if drainage is more than 1 L/day for 5 days, or  if drainage persists for more than 2 weeks despite medical  therapy (17). A surgical approach is considered if a patient\u2019s  nutritional status deteriorates rapidly during conservative  treatment (1). As per previous cases of chylothorax in adult  patients with nephrotic syndrome, repeated thoracentesis or  percutaneous catheter drainage of pleurisy, administration  of diuretics, and intravenous infusion of albumin were  performed as primary treatments in most cases. There was  also a case in which chylothorax and renal vein thrombosis  co-occurred, where chylothorax improved after IST and  chronic anticoagulation (11). Although chemical pleurodesis  with tetracycline was attempted in two cases, its therapeutic  efficacy was difficult to determine, as it resulted in complete  resolution of chylothorax and dependence on regular  hemodialysis after resurgence of chylothorax, respectively  (4,7). In this case, generalized edema and respiratory  distress were alleviated through percutaneous drainage  of chylous effusion and combined diuretic and albumin  therapy. Octreotide, a synthetic analogue of somatostatin  that may reduce the amount of chylous fluid absorbed into  the thoracic duct by inhibiting intestinal chyle production,  was also administered (1). However, the nutritional status  of the patient rapidly deteriorated during conservative  medical therapy, such as alimentary abstinence for 3 weeks  and the combination of TPN and other medications.  Therefore, we performed intranodal lymphangiography  to assess the leakage of lymphatic fluid, followed by TDE  8 Lee et al. MN with chylothorax \u00a9 Annals of Palliative Medicine. All rights reserved. Ann Palliat Med 2023 | https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-23-101 (14,20). During the follow-up period, more than 9 months  after TDE, there was no relapse of chylous pleurisy or  any sequelae related to the radiologic procedure, and the  nutritional status of the patient improved remarkably. The  precise mechanism of intrathoracic lymphatic injury in this  patient was not clear. However, similar to the case described  by Xu et al., it was presumed that disruption of the  lymphatic vessel wall occurred due to tissue edema resulting  from severe hypoalbuminemia, swelling of the lymphatics,  and increased pressure in the thoracic duct, causing leakage  of chylous fluid into the adjacent pleural cavity (12). Conclusions Patients with nephrotic syndrome such as primary MN may  rarely exhibit refractory chylothorax without chylous ascites,  increasing the risk of serious metabolic complications, such  as severe malnutrition. Therefore, upon confirming the  diagnosis of chylothorax associated with primary nephrotic  syndrome, prompt radiologic assessment and appropriate  intervention for lymphatic leakage should be considered in  addition to specific IST for underlying glomerulopathy.

Chylothorax associated with primary membranous nephropathy: a case report. Annals of palliative medicine. 2023 on 30 Jun 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Korea (Republic of) and concerns a 64-year-old male patient who experienced a non-serious adverse reaction of frequent diarrhea with octreotide. The patient visited the nephrology clinic complaining of bilateral lower extremity edema and dyspnea. The patient had developed edema in both lower extremities 4 weeks prior, which progressed gradually. Shortness of breath during exercise started 2 weeks prior, but there were no complaints of cough, sputum, or chest pain at the time of presentation. He had been taking an angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan, 16 mg/day) for hypertension, which was diagnosed 6 months before admission. There was no history of diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, heart failure, or chest trauma. At the time of admission, vital signs showed a blood pressure of 122/62 mmHg, a pulse of 65 beats/min, a respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and a body temperature of 36.6 \u2103. Physical examination revealed decreased breathing sounds in the right chest as well as moderate pitting edema in the pretibial region of both lower legs. Shows the results of peripheral blood examinations and serum biochemistry tests at the time of admission. Serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine (Cr), and estimated glomerular filtration rates were 13.8 mg/dL, 0.8 mg/dL, and 93 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, and microscopic hematuria were noted. On a 24-hour urine study, urinary protein excretion was 4,419 mg/day, and the Cr clearance was 101.7 mL/min. Serological markers, such as Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody (Ab), anti-human immunodeficiency virus Ab, anti-nuclear Ab, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic Ab, and rheumatoid factor, were all negative. Right-side pleurisy was noted on chest computed tomography (CT). On abdominal CT, both kidneys appeared unremarkable, with no evidence of ascites, vascular thrombosis, lymphadenopathy, or malignancy. The was yellowish and pleural fluid aspirated from the thoracentesis milky in appearance, and drainage was maintained after percutaneous catheterization. Pleural fluid analysis led to a diagnosis of lymphocyte-dominant transudate based on the pH of 7.23, 3,200/\u03bcL white blood cells (lymphocytes, 95%), pleural fluid-serum protein ratio of 0.35 (1.7/4.8), and pleural fluid-serum lactate dehydrogenase ratio of 0.36 (62/174). Also, biochemical analysis results of the pleural fluid were consistent with the diagnostic criteria of chylothorax. The pleural fluid microbiologic results, including bacterial and fungal cultures, acid-fast bacilli smear, and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were all negative. Pleural biopsy was not performed. The patient underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy on the third hospital day. A total of 34 glomeruli was identified under a light microscope. No intra-glomerular cell proliferation or abnormalities were observed except for thickening of the glomerular capillary wall. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed immune deposition to immunoglobulin G (2+), complement 3 (1+), kappa (1+), and lambda (1+) in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Multiple subepithelial electron-dense deposits were noted with diffuse foot process effacement on electron microscopy. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome due to MN. The serum concentration of M (muscle)-type anti-phospholipase A2 receptor(anti-PLA2R) Ab was 10.4 RU/mL, which was normal (reference value, <14 RU/mL). The results of serum tumor marker and stool occult blood tests performed to evaluate secondary causes of MN were all negative. On day five, medical treatment for chylothorax was initiated while maintaining the pleurisy tube by stopping enteral feeding, starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and performing a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 mg of octreotide every 8 hours. Administration of an angiotensin receptor blocker was maintained as a conservative treatment for MN. After that, the chylous pleurisy gradually turned white, and the amount of drainage was appreciably reduced. On day 14, dyspnea and peripheral edema resolved. Concurrently, the serum albumin level was 2.3 g/dL, and the spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) was 2.68. However, on day 25, after non-per os for 3 weeks, the amount of chylous effusion increased again when enteral nutrition of a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides was resumed. The patient\u2019s anti-PLA2R Ab titer in serum also increased (50.8 RU/mL). On day 30, the physician instituted specific immunosuppressive therapy (IST) based on the modified Ponticelli regimen for treatment of primary MN. In other words, oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg) was administered daily after an intravenous infusion of 1.0 g of methylprednisolone for three consecutive days. The administration of octreotide was discontinued after 1 month due to frequent diarrhea. Follow-up information has been requested.

Washington Convention Center, Area F, Hall C (Lower Level) Massive Hemoptysis Years After Lung Resection: A Rare Case Where Distorted Lung Architecture Eroded Surrounding Blood Vessels Due to Chronic Cough P. Weeraddana, N. Weerasooriya, T. Thomas, A. Hegde; Internal Medicine, Danbury Hospital, Danbury, CT, United States. Corresponding author's email: wprabasha6@gmail.com Background: Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening condition that can cause airway obstruction, hypoxia, or hemodynamic instability. The common causes of life-threatening hemoptysis include bronchiectasis, bronchogenic cancer, tuberculosis, and fungal infections. Rarely massive hemoptysis can occur when architectural distortion leads to erosion of blood vessels. Case: A 84-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary adenocarcinoma status post right upper and middle lobectomy 7 years ago, presented with episodes of hemoptysis. On admission she was in acute respiratory distress, saturating was 64% on room air. She was tachypneic and tachycardic and has perioral cyanosis. The patient was emergently intubated for airway protection. She was hospitalized twice within the past 4 months with hemoptysis and treated empirically with antibiotics for pneumonia. Computed tomography(CT) of the chest shows no evidence of recurrent or residual malignancy. Her Bronchial lavage was negative for malignant cells, Acid-fast bacillus stain, and culture. The patient has had a chronic hacking cough since 2015. She was on codeine syrup which was recently reduced due to drowsiness. The patient underwent flexible and then rigid bronchoscopy. There was a tongue of cartilage extending into the airway at the level of the right lower lobe. There was a clot overlying this area which was suction, bleeding was immediately noted proximal to this protrusion into the airway (Figure 1). Bleeding was controlled with ice-cold saline, epinephrine, and cauterizing the area of bleeding within her bronchus intermedius. The patient was subsequently taken to interventional radiology. Aortogram and selected spinal angiograms of intercostal arteries were done. However, no obvious source of the hemorrhage artery was identified. She was successfully extubated after 4 days. Discussion: Massive hemoptysis requires emergency treatment. Identifying the bleeding source is critical and should treat the underlying cause to prevent further episodes. The pulmonary and bronchial systems supply the lungs. Although only 2 % of the lungs' blood supply is from the bronchial system,90% of the time massive hemoptysis arises from this high-pressure circulation. Architectural distortion is described as the deformation of normal parenchymal architecture with no distinct visible mass. Our patient had architectural distortion due to a prior lobectomy that made a tongue of cartilage extend into the airway. Her chronic cough from post-radiation and COPD made this cartilage to damage and erosion surrounding blood vessels in this area ultimately causing massive hemoptysis. So it\u2019s paramount to suppress her chronic cough to prevent future episodes.

Corresponding author's email: sagarngpl523@gmail.com Introduction: Blastomycosis is a rare fungal disease that can cause lung infection by inhalation of spores. Blastomyces can present with a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infection to disseminated disease involving the lungs, skin, bone, or even the brain. Here, we present a case of necrotizing pneumonia (NP) caused by Blastomycosis in a patient with recurrent pneumonia. Case Presentation: A 75-year-old nonsmoking male with a history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and recurrent pneumonia over the previous six months treated with multiple antibiotics presented to the hospital with hypoxia. Physical examination revealed dullness to auscultation on the right chest. A chest x-ray showed a large right-sided pleural effusion, and a subsequent CT chest showed a worsening right lower lobe opacity with a central air and fluid component suggesting NP. His labs were significant for a WBC count of 22k/uL, with 86% neutrophils and creatinine of 3.5 mg/dl. Thoracentesis was done twice with drainage of 1500 and 1550 milliliters of exudative fluid. A bronchoscopy with brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage of the right lower lobe was done, and methenamine silver staining showed fungal yeast forms with thick walled broad-based budding confirming Blastomycosis species. The patient was initially started on itraconazole but developed severely elevated transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels, so it was discontinued. The itraconazole was eventually restarted after his liver enzymes trended down. On follow-up, he was tolerating the drug well without laboratory abnormalities or recurrent episodes of pneumonia. Discussion: NP is caused by liquefactive necrosis of consolidated lung tissue. Although commonly described in cases of severe bacterial pneumonia (often caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus), it can also be seen in the setting of fungal or viral pneumonia. Risk factors include diabetes, steroid therapy, smoking, and HIV. CT scan is the most sensitive modality for NP and usually shows lung consolidation with thin cavitations. Early cultures are necessary to diagnose the causative organism. Initiation of early broad-spectrum antibiotics (with anaerobic coverage if abscess is involved) is a mainstay of treatment. Pulmonary gangrene can ensue if the parenchymal vascular supply is compromised, which may necessitate surgical intervention. Conclusion: Patients with recurrent pneumonia resistant to antibiotic treatment should be tested early for underlying fungal infection, especially in endemic regions. The purpose of this case report is to showcase Blastomycosis presenting as NP and how early diagnosis and treatment can make a significant clinical impact for these patients.

The above citation is from a conference abstract. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United States of America and concerns a 75-year-old male patient who experienced non-serious adverse reactions of severely elevated transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels associated with itraconazole. The patient was a non-smoking with a history of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and recurrent pneumonia over the previous six months treated with multiple antibiotics and presented to the hospital with hypoxia. Physical examination revealed dullness to auscultation on the right chest. A chest x-ray showed a large right-sided pleural effusion, and a subsequent CT chest showed a worsening right lower lobe opacity with a central air and fluid component suggesting Necrotizing Pneumonia (NP). His labs were significant for a WBC count of 22k/uL, with 86% neutrophils and creatinine of 3.5 mg/dl. Thoracentesis was done twice with drainage of 1500 and 1550 millilitres of exudative fluid. A bronchoscopy with brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage of the right lower lobe was done, and methenamine silver staining showed fungal yeast forms with thick-walled broad-based budding confirming Blastomycosis species. The patient was initially started on itraconazole but developed severely elevated transaminase and alkaline phosphatase levels, so it was discontinued. The itraconazole was eventually restarted after his liver enzymes trended down. On follow-up, he was tolerating the drug well without laboratory abnormalities or recurrent episodes of pneumonia. Follow-up information has been requested.

Introduction: Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias are unusual sleep behaviors that occur during non-REM stage sleep and can include sleep walking, terrors, or confusional arousals. These disorders result in dissociation events, when experienced by adults they can cause sleep-related injuries. Some causes of these dissociations include disruption in sleep or other health conditions such as fevers, stress, neurological disorders and on occasion, medication side-effects. Here we present a rare case of NREM parasomnia likely induced by patient\u2019s beta blocker use. Case presentation: A 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea presented for parasomnia occurring six out of seven days a week. The sleep behavior occurs within 1 hour of sleep and includes sleep walking and grasping his wife\u2019s arm. He denied recalling vivid dreams or insomnia. The patient underwent polysomnography which did not reveal REM without atonia. A repeated polysomnography with continuous positive airway pressure again didn't reveal REM without atonia or unusual sleep behavior. He had a trial of clonazepam without benefit. Other causes of parasomnia were ruled out including family history, alcohol or substance abuse, anxiety or depression, and post-traumatic-stress disorder. Patient treated with high-dose metoprolol tartrate for over a decade for his hypertension. With guidance of cardiologist, he stopped metoprolol with resolution of his non-REM parasomnia. Discussion: Beta-blockers, are a widely used class of drug treating arrhythmias, heart failure and hypertension. Despite their proven benefit, they have also been associated with sleep disorders and unwanted sleep behaviors. To date, there have been 13 reported cases showing a relationship between beta-blocker medication and sleep disorders. In this case, the patient had no psychiatric history or reported REM or non-REM parasomnias. On review of his records, his non-REM sleep behavior coincided with the initiation of beta-blocker agent. Additionally, his symptoms resolved shortly after discontinuing his metoprolol. A proposed mechanism of beta-blockers resulting in sleep disorders and parasomnias can be explained in light of an observed relationship between 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor occupancy and the propensity to cause sleep disorders in beta-blocking agents based on analysis of the beta-1, beta\u00022, and 5-HT receptor occupancies for different beta-blocking agents. The lipophilic nature of the beta-blocker agent metoprolol was attributed as a potentiating agent for CNS side-effects. Growing evidence suggests that serious parasomnias are associated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Dose reduction or discontinuation of these agents should be considered by clinicians in setting of unexplained causes of non-REM parasomnias.

Corresponding author's email: antojack99@gmail.com Introduction: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive and life-threatening syndrome of excessive immune activation triggered by infection and malignancy resulting in excessive inflammation and tissue destruction. We report a case of HLH triggered by infected staghorn calculus. Case: A 34-year-old female patient was admitted with 4 days of low-grade fever and vomiting. Physical examination was significant for oropharyngeal erythema, enlarged tonsil, cervical lymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash in the bilateral arms.

Discussion: High degree of suspicion of HLH is required because of variable clinical presentations, lack of specificity of clinical and laboratory findings, and diversity of causes. In the case presented prompt recognition of HLH syndrome secondary to underlying pyelonephritis was critical to start appropriate treatment with etoposide and dexamethasone following which the patient had significant clinical improvement.  1 Internal Medicine, Metropolitan Hospital Centre, New York, NY, United States, 2 Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Metropolitan Hospital Centre, New York, NY, United States, 3 Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary Critical Care, Metropolitan Hospital Centre, New York, NY, United States.

This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Germany and concerns a 39-year-old male patient who experienced serious adverse reaction Cushing Syndrome and CMV-reactivation associated with dexamethasone. The patient with a history of childhood idiopathic immune thrombocytopenia presented at the physician\u2019s center with relapsed ITP 25 years after initial splenectomy on 25 Aug 2020. The patient relapsed after an infection of the upper respiratory tract. Prior to presentation at the physician\u2019s center, the patient received multiple short courses of high-dose steroids (dexamethasone), eltrombopag, romiplostime, and triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication in May 2020. The patient presented with petechial bleeding on both legs. Initial platelet count was 4 \u00d7 10^9/ L; leukocytes were normal; and hemoglobin was slightly reduced with 12.1 g/dL platelet count in citrate plasma was 2 \u00d7 10 10^9/ L. Howell-Jolly-bodies could not be detected, while MRI of the abdomen showed three spleen regenerates.

Eighty percent of ITP cases are primary with no known  underlying medical cause. Generally, primary ITP has  a good response to immunosuppressive therapy. First  line therapy is glucocorticoids. For relapse or refractory  patients, thrombopoetin-receptor-agonists, SYK-inhibitor  fostamatinib, or splenectomy are treatment options [1, 2].  As primary ITP is often antibody-mediated, the use of  rituximab for selective depletion of CD20-positive B-cells  was reported in case reports and studies [3]. However,  long-term remissions differ between 10 and 40%. Fol\u0002lowing B-cell depleting therapies, refractory ITP could  be caused due to antibody secretion of long-lived plasma  cells [4]. We hereby report a case of a 39-year old male with  a history of childhood idiopathic immune-thrombo\u0002cytopenia presented at our center with relapsed ITP  25 years after initial splenectomy. The patient relapsed  after an infection of the upper respiratory tract. Prior  to presentation at our center, the patient received mul\u0002tiple short courses of high-dose steroids, eltrombopag,  romiplostime, and triple therapy for Helicobacter  pylori eradication. The patient presented with pete\u0002chial bleeding on both legs. Initial platelet count was  4 \u00d7 109 /L; leukocytes were normal; and hemoglobin  was slightly reduced with 12.1 g/dL platelet count in  citrate plasma was 2 \u00d7 10 109 /L. Howell-Jolly-bodies  could not be detected, while a MRI of the abdomen  showed three spleen regenerates. We initiated rituximab  (375 mg/m2 ) weekly for 8 weeks and hereafter therapy  was switched to fostamatinib; however, both did not  result in an increase in platelets. A laparoscopic sple\u0002nectomy of spleen regenerates was performed but did  not change peripheral platelet counts. At this time point,  the obtained bone-marrow biopsy showed an increased  megakaryopoiesis with no hints of a hematologic  malignancy. During the next months, only repetitive  dexamethasone and IVIG could recover platelet counts  for short time periods. Additionally, repetitive steroid  therapy led to Cushing Syndrome and CMV-reactiva\u0002tion. With this refractory history of ITP, we initiated  daratumumab 1800 mg s.c. on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 q29  for three cycles after patient consent to off-label use.  Six weeks after onset of daratumumab, platelet count  recovered and remained in continuous remission for  now 20 months (Fig. 1). Signs and symptoms of Cush\u0002ing Syndrome rapidly vanished. We obtained patients\u2019  informed consent to data collection and reporting. Daratumumab is widely used in multiple myeloma today,  targeting CD38 on neoplastic plasma cells [5]. First evi\u0002dence of efcacy of daratumab in immune cytopenias was  gained in patients with post-transplant related autoimmune  hemolytic anemia and immune cytopenias [6, 7]. Moreover,  daratumumab seems efective in children and young adults  with autoimmune cytopenias [7]. Migdady et al. reported  one case of successful treatment of thrombocytopenia with  daratumumab after allogeneic transplant and contribute  a literature review of 7 patients successfully treated with  daratumumab in the posttransplant setting [8]. Crickx and  * Tim Str\u00fc\u00dfmann  tim.struessmann@uniklinik-freiburg.de 1 Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University  of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg,  Hugstetter Stra\u00dfe 55, 79106 Freiburg, Germany / Published online: 17 November 2022 Annals of Hematology (2023) 102:245\u2013247 1 3 colleagues described fve cases of refractory ITP, whereby  the number of daratumumab i.v.-infusions varied between  4 and 7, and 3 out of 5 patients responded well with a treat\u0002ment response at the time of the report of 3 and 12 months,  respectively [9]. Reported patients with immune thrombo\u0002cytopenia and daratumumab treatment are summarized in  Table 1. To conclude, daratumumab seems a valid of-label  treatment option for refractory ITP patients. In our patient,  s.c.-daratumumab administration was safe and resulted in  a long-term remission, leading us in two recent severely  refractory ITP patients to conventional ITP treatment to  treat them likewise. Of note, one patient responded like  our frst patient, but the other patient unfortunately did not  respond to daratumumab treatment.

While the majority of infections with H. capsulatum  are asymptomatic and self-limited, immunosuppressed  patients may develop severe, disseminated disease. Few  reports have described disseminated histoplasmosis  following SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection such as  described in this case.

The role of CS in  HIV-negative immunocompromised hosts with PJP remains  unclear. Our study aimed to evaluate HIV-negative critically  ill patients with PJP and respiratory failure to determine if CS  were associated with reduced risk of mortality. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of HIV-negative  critically ill patients with confirmed PJP requiring respiratory  support. Patients were identified via the Premier Incorporated  database. Inclusion criteria were adult patients requiring  respiratory support (supplemental oxygen or non-invasive  ventilation [NIV] and mechanical ventilation [MV]) within 48  hours of PJP diagnosis and intensive care unit admission.  Exclusion criteria consisted of new or existing HIV diagnosis,  death or palliative care within 72 hours, and lack of active PJP  treatment. Patients who did not receive CS were compared  to those who received prednisone equivalents of at least  40mg daily (CS). The primary outcome was in-hospital  mortality. RESULTS: A total of 807 patients were included (n=176  no CS, n=631 CS) with an average age of 62 years and  were 54% male. In the first 48 hours of PJP treatment, 432  patients (54%) required MV and 375 (46%) required NIV.  In-hospital mortality occurred in 75 patients (42.6%) who did  not receive CS and 237 (37.6%) who received CS (Odds  Ratio [OR] 0.81; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.58 to 1.14).  There was no difference in ICU free days (11 days [no CS]  vs 10.8 days [CS]; p=0.72) or 28-day ventilator free days  (13.6 days [no CS] vs 13.3 days [CS]; p=0.55). Furthermore,  subgroup analysis of MV patients revealed no significant  mortality difference with regard to CS treatment (68% no CS  vs 69% CS; OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.14). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are often used for critically  ill HIV-negative patients with PJP and respiratory failure.  However, CS administration to these patients was not clearly  associated with significant reduction in mortality or other  clinical outcomes. Further determination of patient selection  and risk-benefit analysis of CS in this population is warranted.

The above citation is from a conference abstract This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United States of America and concerns a 49-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of tracheobronchial aspergillosis, and PEA arrest associated with dexamethasone. The patient with diabetes presented with encephalopathy, nausea, and malaise and a 1-day history of COVID-19 infection. She was initially stable, on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. She had a WBC of 27,000, procalcitonin: 10.9 ng/ml along with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hemoglobin A1C: 15.5%, and acute kidney injury. She was treated for DKA and started on Remdesivir and Dexamethasone for COVID-19 infection. DKA resolved within 24 hours, however, she became hypoxic, and bradycardic and had a PEA arrest on the second day. After resuscitation, her beta-glucan was 364 pg/ml and Micafungin was started. She then developed severe worsening compliance on the ventilator. CT scan of the chest was non-revealing. Bronchoscopy for concerns of airway obstruction showed diffuse black-green dense exudate in the trachea and bilateral airways with acute inflammation, suggestive of aspergillosis, later confirmed on cultures. She was switched to Amphotericin B. Patient further declined and was transitioned to comfort care after 5 days. Tracheobronchial aspergillosis (TBA) mostly afflicts patients with neutropenia, leukemia, HIV, transplantation, and >3 weeks of steroid treatment. It is also described in ventilated patients with viral infections like influenza. COVID-19 patients are also found to be susceptible to developing TBA with reports of 19-33% of patients having aspergillus in their BAL with a mortality rate of up to 65%. The diagnosis is often elusive prompting redefining guidelines for the diagnosis of TBA. Except for a short course of steroids and uncontrolled diabetes, the present case did not have any other risk factors for TBA. Her accelerated TBA course can be attributed to her COVID-19 and/or its treatment. The CT imaging and ventilator findings could have been explained by COVID-19 infection.

The spectrum of disease  affects 3 million people worldwide and ranges from an  asymptomatic fungal ball to lung destruction. We present  a patient with a history of tuberculosis and pulmonary  aspergilloma which parasitized multiple arterial sources  including the bronchial artery, internal mammary artery, and  several subclavian artery branches with venous fistulization. DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old man presented with 6  months of daily hemoptysis. His past medical history  was significant for diabetes mellitus, severe centrilobular  emphysema, mycobacterium avium complex infection, and  previously treated tuberculosis. A computed tomography  scan of the chest demonstrated a left upper lobe (LUL) mass  with cavitation. He underwent flexible bronchoscopy with  bronchoalveolar lavage and endobronchial biopsy of the  LUL. The fungal culture grew Aspergillus fumigatus which  correlated with the biopsy which revealed a conglomerate  of septate hyphae consistent with an aspergilloma. He was  referred for bronchial artery angiogram with embolization.  During the procedure multiple arterial feeders to the  aspergilloma were identified. This included the left bronchial  artery, left internal mammary artery, left superior thoracic  artery, left thoraco-acromial artery and left lateral thoracic  artery. Each of these arteries supplying the aspergilloma  demonstrated the added complexity of venous fistulization.  Due to the presence of venous fistulas, embolization  was performed using n-butyl cyanoacrylate with lipiodol.  Considering the patient\u2019s clinical stability, length of procedure  and radiation time and contrast administered, as well as the  absence of active bleeding during the procedure, the left  internal mammary artery and left thoraco-acromial artery were  not embolized with the intent of a follow-up procedure. DISCUSSION: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis can cause  life-threatening hemoptysis when arterial feeders develop to  supply an aspergilloma. First line treatment options include  bronchial arterial embolization. This case highlights the  unusual presentation of an aspergilloma that both parasitized  numerous systemic arteries while forming venous fistulas, a  rare phenomenon.", "tokens": [{"text": "United States of America", "start": 402, "end": 426, "token_start": 77, "token_end": 80, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"}, {"text": "49-year-old", "start": 442, "end": 453, "token_start": 84, "token_end": 88, "entityLabel": "PATIENTONSETAGE"}, {"text": "female", "start": 454, "end": 460, "token_start": 89, "token_end": 89, "entityLabel": "PATIENTSEX"}, {"text": "tracheobronchial aspergillosis", "start": 514, "end": 544, "token_start": 97, "token_end": 98, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"}, {"text": "PEA arrest", "start": 550, "end": 560, "token_start": 101, "token_end": 102, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"}, {"text": "encephalopathy,", "start": 633, "end": 648, "token_start": 113, "token_end": 114, "entityLabel": "MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"}, {"text": "nausea", "start": 649, "end": 655, "token_start": 115, "token_end": 115, "entityLabel": "MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"}, {"text": "diabetes", "start": 609, "end": 617, "token_start": 110, "token_end": 110, "entityLabel": "MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"}, {"text": "procalcitonin", "start": 804, "end": 817, "token_start": 154, "token_end": 154, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "hemoglobin A1C", "start": 870, "end": 884, "token_start": 170, "token_end": 171, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "WBC", "start": 789, "end": 792, "token_start": 148, "token_end": 148, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "CT scan", "start": 1270, "end": 1277, "token_start": 251, "token_end": 252, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "non-revealing", "start": 1295, "end": 1308, "token_start": 257, "token_end": 259, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "10.9 ng/ml", "start": 819, "end": 829, "token_start": 156, "token_end": 161, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "15.5%", "start": 886, "end": 891, "token_start": 173, "token_end": 176, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "27,000", "start": 796, "end": 802, "token_start": 150, "token_end": 152, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "Remdesivir", "start": 957, "end": 967, "token_start": 191, "token_end": 191, "entityLabel": "SUSPECTPRODUCT"}, {"text": "Dexamethasone", "start": 972, "end": 985, "token_start": 193, "token_end": 193, "entityLabel": "SUSPECTPRODUCT"}, {"text": "beta-glucan", "start": 1150, "end": 1161, "token_start": 228, "token_end": 230, "entityLabel": "CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"}, {"text": "Micafungin", "start": 1180, "end": 1190, "token_start": 237, "token_end": 237, "entityLabel": "CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"}, {"text": "364 pg/ml", "start": 1166, "end": 1175, "token_start": 232, "token_end": 235, "entityLabel": "DRUGDOSAGETEXT"}], "relations": [{"child": 150, "head": 148, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 156, "head": 154, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 173, "head": 170, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 257, "head": 251, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 232, "head": 228, "relationLabel": "CONCOMITANTDOSAGETEXT"}, {"child": 97, "head": 148, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}, {"child": 154, "head": 101, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}, {"child": 170, "head": 97, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}, {"child": 97, "head": 191, "relationLabel": "SUSPECTREACTION"}, {"child": 193, "head": 97, "relationLabel": "SUSPECTREACTION"}, {"child": 228, "head": 97, "relationLabel": "CONCOMITANTREACTION"}, {"child": 84, "head": 89, "relationLabel": "PATIENTGENDER"}, {"child": 77, "head": 84, "relationLabel": "PATIENTCOUNTRY"}]}, {"document": "Recurrent bilateral lung infiltrates in a patient with ulcerative colitis Antonia Assioura, Georgia Gkrepi, Konstantinos Exarchos , Konstantinos Kostikas , Athena Gogali and Christos Kyriakopoulos Respiratory Medicine Department, University of Ioannina Faculty of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece.

Recurrent bilateral lung infiltrates in a patient with ulcerative colitis. Breathe 2022; 18: 220210 [DOI: 10.1183/20734735.0210-2022]. A 61 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease presented in the emergency department with a 10-day history of dyspnoea in mild physical activity. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) 3 years ago, and 6 months earlier he started treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (he had received two doses of infliximab, the first dose 2 months ago and the second dose 1 month ago) and mesalazine. 1 month after the last dose of anti-TNF-\u03b1 and 6 months after the initiation of therapy for UC he was hospitalised due to fever and severe respiratory failure (arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction: 212) in the gastroenterology department. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed limited emphysema, bilateral ground-glass opacities and mosaic attenuation; thus, anti-TNF-\u03b1 induced interstitial pneumonia was suspected (figure 1a, b). Task 1 What would be the next step in the management of this patient? Choose as many as apply. a) Flexible bronchoscopy b) Initiate empiric treatment with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin or moxifloxacin) c) Discontinue anti-TNF-\u03b1 d) Initiate treatment with corticosteroids Go to Answers >> Due to the severe respiratory failure it was decided that the patient was not fit to undergo bronchoscopy. He was treated with moxifloxacin, systemic corticosteroids with gradual tapering over 2 months and anti-TNF-\u03b1 was discontinued. The patient\u2019s condition improved significantly and he continued receiving mesalazine. In the meantime, he underwent a follow-up chest CT with no ground-glass opacities (figure 2a, b), and he did not present with symptoms compatible with exacerbation of UC. 1 month after the gradual withdrawal of corticosteroids, the patient presented with shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation without symptoms from other systems. On examination, the patient was in mild distress, afebrile (temperature 36.6\u00b0C), tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 20 breaths per min), without tachycardia (heart rate 80 beats per min) and with a room air oxyhaemoglobin saturation of 86%. Physical examination revealed bilateral end-expiratory crackles and was otherwise normal. The leukocyte count was normal, while C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were mildly elevated at 22 mg\u00b7L\u22121 (upper normal limit 6 mg\u00b7L\u22121) and 41 mm\u00b7h\u22121, respectively. Arterial blood gases on room air revealed pH of 7.39, oxygen tension of 62.8 mmHg (8.37 kPa), carbon dioxide tension of 33.5 mmHg (4.46 kPa), bicarbonate of 21.4 mmol\u00b7L\u22121 and serum lactate of 1.40 mmol\u00b7L\u22121.

The clinical condition of the patient improved gradually, with a concomitant improvement of pulmonary functional tests (DLCO 67%, TLC 85% and FVC 3.42 L (82% pred)) (table 1) at 7 days after treatment initiation. He was discharged 1 week after hospitalisation and received oral methylprednisolone with gradual tapering over 3 months with no evidence of residual lung disease in the follow up CT (figure 4a, b). The patient was also reassessed after 6 months, remaining asymptomatic and without evidence of drug-induced pneumonitis relapse or pulmonary functional tests deterioration (table 1). After multidisciplinary discussion with the gastroenterology department, it was decided not to administer any treatment for UC, which was in full remission at present time. a) b) FIGURE 4 a, b) Follow-up chest computed tomography 3 months after the images shown in figure 3 (3 months after mesalazine discontinuation): complete resolution of bilateral ground-glass opacities, small centrilobular nodules and mosaic attenuation. https://doi.org/10.1183/20734735.0210-2022 4 BREATHE CASE REPORT | A. ASSIOURA ET AL. Discussion Bronchopulmonary disease is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of UC, the true prevalence of which is unknown. Interstitial pneumonia associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been described, the most common form being organising pneumonia. Patients may also present with diffuse parenchymal infiltrates induced by medication used for the management of UC (aminosalicylates, methotrexate, thiopurines, anti-TNF-\u03b1) or by opportunistic infections caused by these treatments [1]. In this specific case of a patient with UC presenting with acute respiratory failure, drug-induced pneumonitis was finally attributed to mesalazine treatment. Although mesalazine is usually well tolerated, associated toxicity has been rarely described with eosinophilic, cryptogenic organised or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia as the more typical patterns of respiratory involvement [2, 3]. The duration of treatment with mesalazine before the onset of symptoms varies between 1 month and several years (up to 8 years) [4, 5]. Likewise, anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment is infrequently associated with drug-induced pneumonitis [6\u201310]. The onset of anti-TNF-\u03b1 induced lung injury can emerge between 2 and 6 months after the introduction of the drug, with rare cases occurring up to 44 months after the initial medicine administration [8, 11]. In this case, the relapse of the disease despite the discontinuation of anti-TNF-\u03b1 and receiving therapy with corticosteroids after the first manifestation of drug-induced pneumonitis 3 months ago, led to the investigation of alternative causes. Drug-induced pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, based on clinical suspicion, exposure to a pneumotoxic drug and exclusion of other causes of ILD [12]. In general, clinical, laboratory, radiological and histological features of drug-induced ILD (DI-ILD) are nonspecific and variable even with the same offending drug. The disease may have acute, subacute or chronic onset and the main symptom is worsening of dyspnoea. Patients with suspected DI-ILD should undergo bronchoscopy not only to rule out alternative diagnoses such as opportunistic infections, but also to help define histopathological features based on BAL findings. BAL of DI-ILD is usually a lymphocytic alveolitis with CD4/CD8 <1 ratio [13\u201315]. High-resolution CT findings are also nonspecific, but they can indicate the extent of the disease. Histological confirmation is not mandatory; however, it provides useful data that should be integrated with clinical and radiological findings to support the diagnosis of DI-ILD. In addition, morphological abnormalities of lung tissue, obtained usually by transbronchial biopsy, vary from acute/subacute interstitial pneumonia to established fibrosis and any histological pattern may be caused by a number of different drugs [16\u201318]. ILD in IBD reflects a spectrum of diseases, such as organising pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia (typically in smokers), eosinophilic pneumonia, and usual interstitial pneumonia [19, 20]. In this case ILD could not be attributed to UC as there were no manifestations of UC in other organs and more specifically the large intestine, and ground-glass opacities resolved, despite the discontinuation of the two UC-targeted therapies, anti-TNF-\u03b1 and mesalazine. Conclusion In all cases of ILD in patients with UC, drug-induced pulmonary disease should be excluded. Both anti-TNF-\u03b1 and mesalazine have been implicated in inducing ILD. In patients who receive both of these medicines and develop drug-induced pneumonitis, it is quite difficult to differentiate which one is the actual causing agent. In this case, the withdrawal of anti-TNF-\u03b1 after the first incident of drug-induced pneumonitis and the relapse 6 months after the initiation of therapy, while still receiving mesalazine, led to the discontinuation of mesalazine as the pneumonitis-provoking agent.

The most common primary malig- nancy in pleura is mesothelioma, while the metastatic pro- cess is the most recurrent secondary malignancy [1] . Both mesothelioma and metastatic process constitute the major proportion of malignancy cases in pleura, with the metastatic \u2729 Competing Interests: None. \u2217 Corresponding author.

Mesothelioma is a unique pleural malignancy related to chronic exposure to asbestos and carries an atrocious prog- nosis [4] . It is reported that the estimated annual incidence of mesothelioma is 10.000 across Western Europe, Scandi- navia, North America, Japan, and Australia. Among the said regions, every country reports various incidence rates, from 1.0/100.000 in the United States to 4.2/100.000 in the United Kingdom [ 1 ,5 ]. Radiology plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of pleural tu- mors. The chest X-ray is usually the first modality for patients with thoracic complaints [1] . In patients with malignancy sus- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2022.11.049 1930-0433/\u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of University of Washington.

Several findings suggested that extrapulmonary and pleural origin could be appreciated in chest X-rays, including incom- plete border signs and obtuse angle with the thoracic wall [2] . Pleural effusion is the most occurring secondary finding [4] and can be readily visible when a significant volume of fluid is present. Chest CT scan is a cross-sectional imaging modal- ity often used to visualize the lesion further and characterize its relationship with adjacent organs [1] . From a CT scan, radi- ological appearances of pleural diseases, such as focal or dif- fuse pleural thickening, pleural plaque, and calcification, can be better depicted. CT findings of particular importance in de- termining the pleural or extrapleural origin of the mass in- clude erosion of ribs and inward or outward displacement of extrapleural fat [6] . In some exceptional cases, imaging findings of the pleural tumor might be specific. However, in most other cases, the ap- pearance might not be as specific [6] . Moreover, many pleural conditions have overlapping radiological appearances, mak- ing diagnostic endeavors even more challenging. Here, in this report, we present a case of diffuse pleural metastasis from lung carcinoma mimicking mesothelioma. Case report A 61-year-old male presented in the outpatient clinic with chronic shortness of breath that had worsened in the past 2 weeks. The patient denied prolonged cough and nocturnal perspiration. He was a carpenter for over 30 years, quit 3 years ago, and he was a non-smoker with no history of cancer. Vi- tal signs were normal; nevertheless, the physical examination revealed apparent respiratory effort with lagging right chest movement. The complete blood test did not indicate a signif- icant abnormality. Initial chest X-ray ( Fig. 1 ) showed right pleural effusion with multiple heterogeneous opacities on the right lung. A small nodule was identified in the left paracardial with an evident hyperaeration on the left lung. Subsequent contrast-enhanced chest CT scan ( Fig. 2 ) demonstrated unilateral diffuse nodular pleural thickening in the right hemithorax involving fissures, parietal, visceral, me- diastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura, along with right pleural effusion, causing right compressive atelectasis. No discrete mass was visible in both lung fields, although left lung mul- tiple nodules were noted, and no evidence of chest wall in- volvement. No evidence of a distant metastatic process was observed from the bone survey and abdominal ultrasound. Pleural nod- ules (forceps biopsy, Fig. 3 ) biopsy and IHC test confirmed pul- monary adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 4 ) with wild-type EGFR muta- tion in COBAS EGFR test. The patient underwent four cycles of Pemetrexed-Cisplatin protocol according to the biopsy result. Post-treatment CT scan was planned to evaluate treatment results. However, due to elevated blood creatinine serum, only a non-contrast chest CT scan was performed, and this examination was able to note marked improvement of the pleural thickening ( Fig. 5 ). Fig. 1 \u2013 Pleural effusion, fissure thickening, and inhomogeneous opacities on the right lung were seen in the chest X-ray. A nodule was visible in the paracardial site on the left. Left lung hyperaeration was also evident. Discussion Our case report raises a challenging question on differen- tiating between primary pleural malignancy and metastatic process from a radiological standpoint. Our CT findings, with unilateral diffuse nodular pleural thickening, are highly sug- gestive of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is known as nodular thickening of the pleura that occur strictly unilateral but cir- cumferentially diffuse, involving fissures and diaphragmatic pleura, and may also affect the pericardium [ 4 ,7 ,8 ]. Mesothe- lioma also often causes volume loss in the affected lung, causing elevation of the diaphragm, narrowing of intercostal space, and mediastinal shift [ 4 ,7 ]. Nonetheless, mesothelioma rarely appears as a localized mass [7] . Although common in mesothelioma, pleural effusion is not a specific finding and may occur in other malignant pathologies, such as metastatic processes, and benign processes, such as heart failure [ 3 ,8 ]. In advanced disease, metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes and lung nodules may also present [7] . Histopathology examination in our case, however, has con- firmed the pathology to be adenocarcinoma originating from the lung. From our reference study, we found that adenocar- cinoma more often metastasizes to pleura than other types of histopathology, with the most common origins from the lung, breast, and ovarium [6] . Radiological findings of pleural metastasis include pleural effusion (most frequently from the breast), as well as focal or diffuse pleural thickening with in- volvement of parietal and visceral pleura. Lung fissures may also be affected [3] . Although diffuse pleural thickening may be found both in mesothelioma and metastatic process, Kim Fig. 2 \u2013 Axial (A) with coronal- (B) and sagittal-reformatted (C) contrast-enhanced chest CT showed diffuse irregular pleural thickening involving fissures, parietal, visceral, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura. Multiple nodules in the left lung were confirmed, with the largest dimension measuring approximately 1.9 cm (D). Fig. 3 Fig. 4 \u2013 Histopathology from biopsy (A) with 40 \u00d7 magnification showed tumor growth in a glandular pattern, which consists of the proliferation of anaplastic cells with round-oval, pleomorphic, and rough chromatin nuclei, consistent with adenocarcinoma. IHC smear (20 \u00d7 magnification) with Napshin-A positive within the tumor cell cytoplasm (B) and WT-1 negative in tumor cell nuclei (C), suggesting tumor origin from the lung. Fig.5 \u2013 Post-treatment unenhanced chest CT scan in axial (A) with coronal- (B) and sagittal-reformatted (C) plane show marked improvement in overall pleural and fissure thickening. Multiple right lung nodules can be well appreciated with the right lung fully expanded and without right pleural effusion. There is also a reduction in the greatest dimension of the left lung nodule (D), measured at approximately 1.1 cm (greater than 20% reduction). discovered that circumferential thickening, defined as contin- uous thickening involving greater than three-quarters of the pleura, is more related to mesothelioma [8] . Pleural metastasis may present as a sizeable solitary mass measuring up to 8-13 cm, as reported in several case reports [ 9 ,10 ]. Adenocarcinoma is a part of the major lung cancer group non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), constituting approxi- mately 40% of NSCLC [11] . NSCLC is the most common group of all lung malignancies, constituting 80%-87% of lung can- cer [ 12 ,13 ]. The other infrequent group, small cell lung can- cer, constitutes the rest and is associated with smoking and is more aggressive [13] . NSCLC may be situated either cen- trally or peripherally [13] , although one study reported that adenocarcinoma has a strong predilection in the peripheral site [12] . Radiological findings may vary from consolidation, ground-glass opacity, or a mix of both [13] . With the absence of discrete mass on visualized lungs, an- other minor possibility to consider is primary pleural adeno- carcinoma. However, in our literature study, we were unable to find any report of primary pleural adenocarcinoma. The clos- est condition that has been reported is primary pleural squa- mous cell carcinoma (SCC) [ 14 ,15 ], considering SCC belongs to NSCLC, the same group as adenocarcinoma in lung can- cer classification [12] . The reported radiological findings of pri- mary SCC in 2 case reports were single pleural nodule with no signs of invasion [14] , bilateral pleural effusion and irregular thickening with involvement of fissures and pericardium, as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy [15] . Other pleural eti- ologies considered rare from various literature include pleural lipoma, pleural splenosis, pleural pseudotumor, desmoplas- tic small round cell tumor, pleural involvement of Erdheim- Chester disease, diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis, syn- ovial sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, lymphoma, thymoma, and amyloidosis [ 1 \u20133 ,5 ,6 ]. Recently, there has been a development of targeted lung cancer therapy due to the discovery of EGFR mutation found in lung cancer. Nevertheless, in our case, the EGFR mutation status was confirmed to be wild-type. Many studies have been conducted to predict the EGFR mutation status of lung cancer based on imaging, stipulating that the EGFR mutation is asso- ciated with females and non-smokers. Radiological features associated with EGFR mutation are ground-glass attenuation of the tumor, the presence of air bronchogram, vascular con- vergence, spiculated margin, and pleural retraction [16] . On the other hand, wild-type EGFR tend to be linked to male and smoking [17] and is less likely to cause diffuse metastatic pro- cess [18] . To the best of our knowledge, the study related to EGFR mutation status and metastatic behavior of lung tumors is still relatively limited. EGFR mutation is more likely to cause diffuse \"miliary\" metastasis involving both lungs [19] , whereas EGFR wild-type is more likely to cause pleural metastasis [20] . However, further study is requisite to establish the ground of this concept. Conclusion Pleural mass remains a significant challenge for radiologists. A wide range of pathologies may arise in pleura, and their ra- diological appearance may overlap one another. A specialized multidisciplinary team is necessary to establish the diagnosis and plan the best course of action for patients\u2019 outcomes.

In this article we present a case of a patient with a first episode of severe depression with COVID-19-related psychotic features. A 59-year-old man with no history of mental disorders was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit due to the symptoms of a severe depressive episode with psychotic features. Since March 2020, progressive deterioration of his mental health in the form of profound lowering of mood, anhedonia and lack of energy was observed. He was not infected nor exposed to infectious agents but presented delusions about being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and being a source of transmission to other people by using the toilet or going out. He suffered from Hashimoto disease and lymphoma diagnosed two months prior to the hospitalization with further diagnosis postponed due to the pandemic. He was administered venlafaxine 150 per day and mirtazapine 45 mg per day with addition of olanzapine up to 20 mg and risperidone up to 6 mg per day. No side effects were reported. The patient made a full recovery with the exception of slightly blunted ability to feel pleasure, minor problems with concentration and occasional pessimistic thoughts. The social distancing recommendations during the pandemic put a psychological strain related to alienation and negative emotions which in turn can favor development of depressive symptoms. Analysis of psychological mechanisms related to the pandemic and restrictions is significant for limiting the negative influence of global crisis on individual mental well-being. In this case the impact of global anxiety and its consequential integration into the developing psychopathological symptoms is especially interesting. The circumstances surrounding an episode of affective disorder may shape its course and thought content. Key words: delusions, SARS-CoV-2, depressive episode 946 Agnieszka Cyran et al. Introduction The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a major impact on both physical and mental health.. The pandemic has already reached almost 200 millions of laboratory- confirmed cases globally including up to 3 millions in Poland alone, and so far resulted in over 4 million deaths worldwide (data on 29th of July, 2021) [1]. However, its impact on mental health is further amplified by the presence of regional restrictions to limit further transmission of the virus. Although the neurotropism of SARSCoV- 2 has already been confirmed, the occurrence of psychopathological symptoms does not typically result from the infection [2]. The recent reports indicate that major psychological distress associated with the pandemic and social isolation recommendations can lead to relapse in patients with history of previous mental disorders [3\u20135]. Moreover, a multi-center study conducted in Denmark shows that manifestation of pandemic-related symptoms in patients attending local mental health centers correlates with current COVID-19 incidence and restrictions [6]. However, there is also some evidence of newly-developed mental disorders as a result of SARS-CoV-2 emergence and spread [4, 7, 8\u201313]. As it turns out, COVID-19 infection is not a crucial risk factor of exhibiting psychopathological symptoms. Stress related to the pandemic and restrictions resulting from it led to significant increase in morbidity, with anxiety symptoms detected in up to half of participants of studies conducted in various regions [14\u201321]. A meta-analysis comprised of 28 studies indicates occurrence of PTSD, anxiety and depressive symptoms in 26% of participants in various populations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [22]. In this article we present a case of a patient with a first episode of severe depression with COVID-19-related psychotic features despite that fact he was not diagnosed nor exposed to novel coronavirus whereas he was suffering from a lymphoma which diagnosis and treatment were postponed due to the pandemic. After the end of treatment, the patient consented to the publication of the case report Case presentation Medical history and mental state on admission A 59-year-old man was admitted to the Inpatient Psychiatric and Psychogeriatric Unit due to the severe depressive episode with psychotic features. He had no history of previous mental disorders. He is married to a wife with whom he has good relations and they have no children. He has higher economic education and has been working as an accountant for over 30 years. There was no history of alcohol or drug abuse. There are no mental disorders, drug or alcohol abuse nor suicidal death in his family. He has been treated for hypothyroidism in the course of Hashimoto disease. Several months before the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms he was diagnosed with non\u2013Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma localized in neck area. The patient was consulted hemaNovel psychopathological picture during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a first episode 947 tologically. Further diagnosis and treatment were postponed due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as his condition did not require an urgent intervention. At the initial phase of the pandemic he was working as usual but limited his contacts with others adhering to the general restrictions. None of his family members, friends or co-workers has been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and he was not quarantined. He did not exhibit any symptoms of an infectious disease. Progressive deterioration of his mental health was observed in March of 2020. He experienced sadness, lack of energy and interest, anhedonia. He reported insomnia in the form of shortened night sleep with early awakening, as well as lack of appetite and weight loss. Moreover, he was convinced that he could not cope with anything, he felt helpless and spent time idly. He also felt emotionally empty and believed his life had no value. With time he developed delusions of being severely ill and close to death. He became convinced that he was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and was spreading the virus to other people by using the toilet or going out. Additionally, he expected punishment and prison for being the source of the virus. Due to the severity of depressive symptoms clearly affecting the patient\u2019s daily functioning, including meeting basic life needs, in April 2020 he became unable to continue his professional work. Despite his lymphoma diagnosis, there were no somatic causes of his lack of energy, weight loss and malaise. His hematologist suggested a psychiatric consultation which resulted in the patient being referred to the psychiatric hospital. He had undergone a standard nasopharyngeal swab towards SARS-CoV-2 infection which came back negative. At admission the patient was sitting at the edge of the bed with his head down looking miserable and gloomy, making sporadic eye contact. His speech was quiet and slow. He was fully conscious, oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Verbal contact with him was formal but not fully substantive. He was in deeply depressed mood and his affect was restricted to the depressed range, periodically anxious. Psychomotor activity was decreased and apathy, anhedonia and emotional emptiness were observed. He had coherent line of thoughts, pessimistic thoughts and exhibited apparent delusions of guilt and punishment as well as delusions of reference. He did not demonstrate looseness of associations or hallucinations. Sleep and appetite were reduced. His insight and judgment were poor and superficial. He scored 49 points in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [23]. His physical examination and blood tests did not reveal any abnormalities. Thyroid hormones and TSH levels indicated euthyreosis (TSH 3.58 uIU/ml with a norm between 0.4\u20134; FT3 5.71 pmol/l with a norm between 2.76\u20136.45; and FT4 12.8 pmol/l with a norm between 11.4\u201322.5). Clinical management In the first days after admission high levels of psychotic anxiety were reported in the patient. He presented delusions of guilt and hypochondriac delusions, questioned 948 Agnieszka Cyran et al. the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 test. He declared that due to the non\u2013Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma diagnosis he only had one year of life left despite the contrary information provided by his hematologist. On occasions he also presented delusions of persecution \u2013 he believed that his hospital stay was a result of an anonymous denunciation made by a paramedic due to the epidemic hazard he had posed and that his food and liquids at the ward may be poisoned, so that he limited his food intake. Despite the fact he lacked energy and his psychomotor activity was decreased, his insomnia persisted. He was administrated venlafaxine 150 mg per day and mirtazapine 45 mg per day with addition of olanzapine up to 20 mg per day, which were gradually augmented with risperidone up to 6 mg per day due to ongoing presence of delusions. He tolerated the treatment very well. Additionally, he was administered 25 micrograms of thyroxine supplementation a day according to his previous treatment. As a result of the administered treatment, the patient gradually increased his activity, began to spend time with other patients, attended therapeutic classes and walks to the garden with a therapist. Moreover, a decreased focus on the pandemic or lymphoma\u2013related health issues was observed. After 5 weeks of the treatment, the patient presented significant improvements in his mental state allowing for discontinuation of olanzapine and reduction of risperidone down to 4 mg per day. No deterioration of his mental state was observed in response to the treatment modification. Psychological examination During the psychological examination performed on the 13th of July, the patient was auto and allo-oriented. Psychometric testing of cognitive functioning measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) [24, 25] showed a general absence of cognitive impairment (26/30 points). He correctly performed the tasks assessing the efficiency of eye-hand coordination, naming and abstract thinking. His efficiency in terms of the attention was within normal range and did not show any impairment of linguistic functions. However, long-term episodic memory deficits were observed at recall despite the overall score of cognitive functioning maintained within normal range. In the task assessing the ability to restore the memorized auditory material after the delay, the patient remembered one out of five previously learned words. Clinical evaluation and diagnostics conducted with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD) detected no diagnostic criteria of personality disorders [26]. After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient had a low or average severity of psychopathological symptoms measured with the SCL-90 Questionnaire (Table 1) [27, 28]. Novel psychopathological picture during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a first episode 949 Table 1. Results obtained on the SCL-90 questionnaire after treatment Symptoms Raw score (converted score) Interpretation Somatization 0 (0) low Obsessive-Compulsive 11 (1.1) average Interpersonal Sensitivity 10 (1.1) average Depression 11 (0.8) low Anxiety 5 (0.5) low Hostility 4 (0.7) average Phobic Anxiety 1 (0.1) low Paranoid Ideation 3 (0.5) low Psychoticism 8 (0.8) average MRI of the brain revealed single, minor ischemic lesions and ruled out metastases or malignant infiltrations, which could underlie a depressive disorder due to a general medical condition. Considering the whole clinical picture, the diagnosis of major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Due to the endogenous character of the disorder, the prognosis includes potential relapses and therefore, long-term treatment. The patient had reached a full recovery with the exception of slightly blunted ability to feel pleasure, minor problems with concentration and occasional pessimistic thoughts which at this point were associated with the diagnosis of lymphoma and anxiety regarding further somatic treatment. At his discharge the patient scored 3 points on the MADRS and was discharged with a recommendation to attend the outpatient psychiatric clinic for further treatment. At the first follow-up after 2 months since the discharge, the achieved recovery was stable, however, slight sedation and psychomotor retardation were observed. Further reduction of risperidone down to 2 mg per day and mirtazapine to 30 mg per day was ordered and led to improvement of patient\u2019s daily activity. The patient was able to go back to work and his usual activities such as biking or playing cards with his friends. After one year the patient confirmed that he still regularly takes his medication and visits a specialist at the outpatient clinic, which allows him to maintain his proper activity. During that time he did not develop any episodes of affective disorders. Patient perspective At the follow-up after 4 months, the patient was satisfied with complete reduction of his primary concerns. He did not report any symptoms of the disease nor side effects of the administered treatment. He regarded the disease as a reaction to excessive stress resulting from the onset of pandemic and did not consider prescribed drugs to 950 Agnieszka Cyran et al. be vital in his recovery. However, he could not explain why his symptoms did not reappear with the increase of COVID-19 incidence reported in the country. Despite that he decided to continue regular treatment and adhere to the recommendations. Additionally, he emphasized kind reception of his episode by his family and friends, which had concerned him at the time of the discharge. Discussion The foreseen rise of mental health problems related to the ongoing pandemic, lockdowns and quarantines has been confirmed by the recent literature. However, evidence indicates that sole fact of being quarantined does not significantly influence mental well-being compared to the consequences related to following restrictions on a daily basis [29]. The cases of relapses of psychosis or affective disorders resulting from rigorous restrictions and social isolation have been described [3\u20135]. It is assumed that people with previous history of mental disorders may be susceptible to worsening of their mental state due to the emergence of a novel virus and associated uncertainty and anxiety. This phenomenon is associated with the weakened action of defense mechanisms and more sensitive mental structure of this population. On the other hand, the major stressors are known to facilitate expression of mental disorders such as psychosis or affective diseases, however, this typically happens in early-life. Social distancing recommendations especially impact psychological burden associated with the feeling of alienation and negative emotions. These, in turn, in positive feedback loop with anxiety symptoms can favor development of PTSD or depressive symptoms [30]. Individual traits, such as social cognitive bias or low efficiency of emotional regulation lead to increased affective response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [31]. Loneliness poses another consequence of social distancing which significantly influences one\u2019s affective response [32]. Female sex, COVID-19 infection among family members, younger age, lower socioeconomic status, and previous history of physical diseases or mental disorders are listed as risk factors of decreased mental well-being in conditions of global pandemic [33\u201335]. Interestingly, none of those was present in the above-described case. The psychological traits observed in people susceptible to development of depressive or anxiety symptoms as a result of coronaphobia are high level of neuroticism, hypochondriasis and presence of reassurance\u2013seeking behaviors [36]. Interestingly, a protective influence of age above 60 against development of anxiety or depressive symptoms during the pandemic was reported, which can be associated with more effective emotional regulation and stress tolerance in older people [37]. This case presents a middle-aged man with no history of affective and anxiety disorders nor personality traits which can predispose to development of depressive symptoms. No risk factors other than physical diseases were observed. It suggests the necessity to be vigilant while dealing with psychopathological symptoms related to Novel psychopathological picture during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a first episode 951 coronaphobia. The potential pathophysiological influence of hypothyroidism resulting from Hashimoto disease needs to be taken into account. Patients with endocrinological disorders are undoubtedly at risk of depressive disorders, which can be associated with potential inflammatory pathology of depression. The presented patient had been successfully treated for hypothyroidism for over 10 years. In this case, a subconscious reactive factor such as serious hematological disease \u2013 a lymphoma which treatment had been postponed \u2013 may be of relevance. The pandemic and accompanying feeling of social endangerment acted as a trigger for development of severe depressive episode with psychotic features. The main message present both in society and media has been integrated as a part of the delusions, which primarily concerned current pandemic, and belief that the patient was a source of viral transmission. It has been described that the sociodemographic background and surrounding can greatly impact the content of delusions [5, 38]. There is apparent evidence of thought content alteration, with one instance of COVID-19-related delusions replacing prior symptoms, as a result of the pandemic [13]. Despite having no significant exposure or risk of contracting the virus disease, our patient developed a system of delusions related to this topic instead of his potentially more severe health problem, a newlydiagnosed lymphoma. This case illustrates development of a first depressive episode in conditions of relevant social stressor and furthermore, a response to combination pharmacological treatment. The preliminary findings suggest that novel cases of mental disorders developed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic tend to respond to the pharmacological intervention relatively quickly, while in this case a significant improvement was obtained during 5 weeks. Interestingly, the recovery correlated with the intensity of the pandemic news which our patient was exposed to before admission and at the ward. The term infodemic accurately describes both common and novel mental problems related to pandemic and puts special emphasis on potential management of such psychiatric consequences of pandemic by reducing the intensity or amount of exposure to the stressful stimuli [10]. Analysis of psychological mechanisms related to the pandemic and restrictions is significant for limiting the negative influence of global crisis on individual mental well-being [39\u201342]. On the other hand, a potential more direct causal influence of the virus on the occurrence of mental disorders is yet to be excluded [43]. Conclusions The middle-aged people are susceptible to the development of depressive disorders although this period of life is considered to be protective for development of pandemic\u2013related anxiety. Usually, it is possible to ascertain the significant personal events, although the connection between major life events and symptoms of psychiatric disorders is rarely direct. In this case, the impact of global anxiety related to SARS952 Agnieszka Cyran et al. CoV-2 pandemic and its consequential integration into the developing symptoms of affective disorder in the form of major psychotic depression is especially significant. The circumstances surrounding a developing episode of mental disorder may shape its course and thought content. Therefore, the mental health professionals should consider the potential overflow of negative information as a key factor in occurrence of psychopathological symptoms in susceptible individuals. Conscious media output and its influence on mental health need to be taken into account as a part of health policy during the global crisis.

Rapidly Progressing to ESRD in an Individual with Coexisting ADPKD and Masked Klinefelter and Gitelman Syndromes. Genes. 2022;13(3):394 on 13 Jan 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Spain and concerns an adult male patient of unknown age, who experienced a non-serious adverse reaction of hypotension associated with telmisartan intolerance The proband, a 36 year-old male German patient presented in the author\u2019s outpatient clinic for renal evaluation in April 2016. He was the fourth child of unrelated and healthy parents. He was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The family history was negative for abortion and genetic abnormalities. He was diagnosed with arrhythmia at 21, and epididymal cysts at 27 years old in Germany. At that age, abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed bilateral, enlarged, cystic, and echogenic kidneys being diagnosed with Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Surgical intervention of bilateral inguinal hernias was undertaken in Germany. At this time, the patient was also receiving intermittent treatment with Ramipril (5 mg/daily), which was finally discontinued. His serum creatinine levels were 2 mg/dl with an eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m2. His father was alive at 77 years old without a history of ADPKD or any other renal disease. His mother died at the age of 51 (unrelated to genetic known cardiac/renal disorder). His three brothers were asymptomatic based on medical history. There was no history of intracranial aneurysms, ADPKD, or other renal diseases in other family members. The first physical examination (in 2016, at 36 years old) established a well-developed male (weight, 85 kg; height, 196 cm; body mass index (BMI), 22.1 Kg/m2), presenting a decreased testicular volume. Blood pressure was 115/70 mmHg without any treatment. His serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dL and eGFR of 27 mL/min/1.73 m2. ECG showed a complete blockage of the right branch of the bundle of His, and abdominal MRI documented bilateral, enlarged, cystic kidneys. A TKV, 726 mL (right kidney 336 mL, left kidney 390 mL) and htTKV, 370 mL/m were measured by manual segmentation using MRI. The physician classified the patient into Mayo class 1B. However, the prediction of future eGFR based on Mayo imaging classification determined and estimated end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at 48 years old. No liver cysts were appreciated. The patient also had a saccular cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery measuring 11 \u00d7 5 mm, which the physician established by MRI angiography and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) angiography and arteriography. An intent of embolization resulted in failure, and he denied surgical intervention of the aneurysm. He was married but without offspring. Due to couple infertility, the patient also underwent urologic evaluation in the current Centre, which confirmed epididymal cysts and diagnosed azoospermia. Indeed, he had increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) (24.70 IU/L; normal range: 1.50\u20139.30 IU/L) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (60.12 IU/L; normal range: 1.40\u201318.10 IU/L) with normal prolactin (15.66 ng/mL; normal range: 2.10\u201317.70 ng/mL) and total testosterone (4.49 ng/mL; normal range: 1.65\u20137.53 ng/mL), but low free testosterone levels (12.30 pg/mL; normal range: 15.0\u201350.0 pg/mL). His triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin T4, thyroid stimulating (TSH) hormones, and vitamin-D (48 ng/mL; normal range: 30\u2013100 ng/mL) levels were normal, but parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (levels (169 pg/mL; normal range: 18.5\u201388.0 pg/mL) were increased. Bone mineral density examination also showed marked osteoporosis. A control CT cerebral angiography performed 18 months after the first observation (at 38 years old) revealed that the cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery had increased up to 11.9 \u00d7 5.3 mm. At 42 years old, his serum creatinine level was 5.4 mg/dL and eGFR was 12 mL/min/1.73 m2. Several intents of treatment with a low dose of Telmisartan (10 mg/daily) resulted in hypotension and were discontinued. Since genetic studies showed a likely pathogenic missense mutation in PKD1 in heterozygosis, the physician classified the patient as PROPKD 4 score (low risk of progression) and Mayo class 1B (low risk of progression). However, his TKV and htTKV values were significantly smaller than two of the current PKD1 cohorts used to monitor the current proband (PKD1 patients \u2264 40 years, and PKD1 with BMI < 25), but not smaller than PKD1 without hypertension. In fact, eGFR in the proband was significantly lower than the three PKD1 cohorts, according with his prediction of future eGFR (ESRD at 48 years, high risk of progression). Interestingly, the proband had no clinical features related to Gitelman syndrome (GS), at all. He showed that the serum magnesium (1.6\u20132.0 mg/dL) and potassium levels (3.9\u20134.7 mmol/L), and venous (pH 7.31\u20137.41) were within normal limits, although HCO3- levels in blood were inappropriately higher (24\u201331 mmol/L) for his grade of CRF. It was remarkable that during the follow-up course his blood pressure remained normal to low, despite the presence of severe Chronic renal failure (CRF), including ESRD; he also had an intolerance to telmisartan treatment. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenetic hereditary renal disease, promoting end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a consequence of an extra copy of the X chromosome in males. Main symptoms in KS include hypogonadism, tall stature, azoospermia, and a risk of cardiovascular diseases, among others. Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by SLC12A3 variants, and is associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, normal or low blood pressure, and salt loss. The three disorders have distinct and well-delineated clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings. The author here, reported a male patient with ADPKD who developed early chronic renal failure leading to ESRD, presenting with an intracranial aneurysm and infertility. NGS identified two de novo PKD1 variants, one known (likely pathogenic), and a previously unreported variant of uncertain significance, together with two SLC12A3 pathogenic variants. In addition, cytogenetic analysis showed a 47, XXY karyotype. The authors investigated the putative impact of this rare association by analyzing possible clinical, biochemical, and/or genetic interactions and by comparing the evolution of renal size and function in the proband with three age-matched ADPKD (by variants in PKD1) cohorts. The authors hypothesize that the coexistence of these three genetic disorders may act as modifiers with possible synergistic actions that could lead, in the patient, to a rapid ADPKD progression.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenetic hereditary renal disease, promoting end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a consequence of an extra copy of the X chromosome in males. Main symptoms in KS include hypogonadism, tall stature, azoospermia, and a risk of cardiovascular diseases, among others. Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by SLC12A3 variants, and is associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, normal or low blood pressure, and salt loss. The three disorders have distinct and well-delineated clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings. We here report a male patient with ADPKD who developed early chronic renal failure leading to ESRD, presenting with an intracranial aneurysm and infertility. NGS identified two de novo PKD1 variants, one known (likely pathogenic), and a previously unreported variant of uncertain significance, together with two SLC12A3 pathogenic variants. In addition, cytogenetic analysis showed a 47, XXY karyotype. We investigated the putative impact of this rare association by analyzing possible clinical, biochemical, and/or genetic interactions and by comparing the evolution of renal size and function in the proband with three age-matched ADPKD (by variants in PKD1) cohorts. We hypothesize that the coexistence of these three genetic disorders may act as modifiers with possible synergistic actions that could lead, in our patient, to a rapid ADPKD progression. Keywords: ADPKD; apoptosis; chronic kidney disease progression; fibrosis; Gitelman syndrome; intracranial aneurysm; Klinefelter syndrome 1. Introduction Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is mainly caused by mu\u0002tations in two main genes, PKD1 (OMIM#: 601313) and PKD2 (OMIM#: 173910) [1,2]. It is characterized by renal, progressive, age-related, fluid-filled cyst development, pro\u0002moting ESRD [3,4]. It is widely known that phenotype variability is highly associated with the mutated gene (PKD1 variants versus PKD2 variants), and the type of the variant (frameshift/nonsense versus non-truncating variants) [5]. However, the existence of sev\u0002eral modulator genes, and the existence of hypomorphic alleles may also largely affect the clinical features of ADPKD [5\u201312], including extra-renal clinical manifestations such as hepatic cysts, hernias, mitral valve prolapse, and intracranial aneurysms [3,4]. The renal Genes 2022, 13, 394. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13030394 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes Genes 2022, 13, 394 2 of 14 disease progression of ADPKD involves not only cystogenesis, but also the activation of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways as a consequence of endothelial dysfunction [13,14]. Indeed, ADPKD, as a single gene disorder, is associated with numerous signaling cascades and reactions involved in cellular polarity, proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis [13\u201315]. Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common genetic cause of infertility, and is the most variable aneuploidy (0.15% of the general population), showing high phenotypic variability and comorbidities. It is one of the common sex chromosome disorders in men. Inter\u0002estingly, approximately 64% of these cases were undiagnosed throughout life [16,17]. A non-disjunction of paired X-chromosomes during the first or second meiotic division [17] may contribute to its origin, and is equally due to a paternal/maternal meiotic missegrega\u0002tion event. KS clinical manifestations were associated with increased risk for mitral valve prolapse, pulmonary embolism, aortic valvular disease, autoimmune diseases, the rupture of the berry aneurysms, lower-extremity varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis, venous stasis ulcers, type II diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [18\u201321], extra-gonadal germ cell tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [22], a 20-fold-higher risk of developing breast cancer, and osteoporosis. KS patients also have hypogonadism, which may increase the risk of atherogenesis [18]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the KS phenotype have not been clearly understood yet, although both genetic and epigenetic effects, due to the supernumerary X-chromosome, seem to contribute to this pathological pattern [23\u201326]. Gitelman syndrome (GS, OMIM #263800) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the SLC12A3 gene which encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na+/Cl\u2212 cotransporter. GS is clinically characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypereninemia, and hyperaldosteronism with normal or low blood pressure and salt loss [27]. Most of patients with GS present during childhood or early adulthood, however, it has high clinical variability, and some patients may not have GS features [27\u201331]. We here report a patient with ADPKD and coexisting masked KS and GS, based on genetic studies and clinical features. Although the three disorders may have different genetic, biochemical, and clinical findings, it is possible that the overlapping findings have influenced each other. We investi\u0002gated the possibility that this fact may be a consequence of putative genetic interactions and/or additive or synergistic effects through the different signaling pathways. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Follow-Up Study We compared the clinical evolution of ADPKD in the proband with our three control PKD1 defined cohorts by kidney magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [32] and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) studies. To this end, total kidney volume (TKV), height adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV), and eGFR were determined. The eGFR was de\u0002termined by the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation using the serum creatinine and the serum cystatin C values calculated using the formula: eGFRCysC = 77.24 \u00d7 (Cys\u22121.2623). Mayo clinic imaging classification and the prediction of future eGFR based on the classification were determined in the proband [33]. 2.2. Genetics Analysis 2.2.1. ADPKD by MLPA Analysis ADPKD gross deletion analysis was made by means of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using the SALSA MLPA KIT P351/P352 for PKD1/PKD2 (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Data analysis was done with Coffalyser v6 MLPA Analysis Software (MRC-Holland). 2.2.2. Massive Parallel Sequencing Analysis Massive parallel sequencing analysis was performed with a custom-targeted next\u0002generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel (Nefroseq v1.2) designed for the study of the full spectrum of genetic nephropathies (which includes 380 genes related to kidney dis- Genes 2022, 13, 394 3 of 14 eases) [34]. The sequence was captured using SeqCap EZ technology (Roche Nimblegen. Madison, WI, USA) and subsequently ran on a Hiseq4000 (Illumina. San Diego, CA, USA). Bioinformatics analysis was performed in-house by using publicly available software tools (trimmomatic-0.32; Bowtie2 v2.1.0; Picard-tools v1.27; Samtools v0.1.19-44428cd; Bedtools v2.26.0; Genome Analysis TK v3.3-0 y SnpE 4.1l; ClinVar date 20140703 dbscSNV1.1 db\u0002NSFP version 3.0 dbSNP v138), and simultaneously with variant Caller V2.1 tool (Illumina). In silico pathogenicity prediction was analyzed using Alamut 2.7 (interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) and others such as SIFT Ensembl 66; Polyphen-2 v2.2.2; Mutation Assessor, release 2; FATHMM, v2.3; Gerp2; PhyloP; CADD, v1.3. Population frequencies of the de\u0002tected variants were assessed using the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; Exac r0.3) data; 1000 genome project; Spanish Exon Variant Project; NHLBI exome sequencing project: ESP6500_EA_AF). After the filtering of the relevant variants, validation of the candidate variants in the patient and parents was carried out through traditional Sanger Sequencing (see below). In parallel to the analysis process, exhaustive quality control of the sequenced samples was performed according to a custom pipeline (a suite of QC scripts that facilitate data quality assessment), available upon request. Classification and interpretation of the variants were made according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. 2.2.3. Sanger Sequencing PKD1 mutation screening for coding sequences and intron/exon boundaries for exons 27 and 29 were confirmed by Long Range-PCR and direct sequencing. SLC12A3 mutation screening for coding sequences and intron/exon boundaries for exons 16 and 25 was performed by PCR and direct sequencing. PCR conditions and primers (designed with the help of Primer3 plus v04.0 Software) are available upon request. PCR products were sequenced using BrightDye Terminator cycle kit (Nimagen, Nijmegen, The Netherland) and run on an ABI3730XL Sequencer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.2.4. Azoospermia Studies Our pipeline routine for azoospermia studies includes microdeletions of the Y-chromosome, karyotyping, and cystic fibrosis analysis. The Y-chromosome microdeletions analysis was performed by standard fragment analysis, by multiplex PCR of STS markers and direct sequencing (primers are available upon request). The molecular diagnosis of Y-chromosome microdeletions was performed following the recommendations of the EAA/EMQN best practice guidelines [35]. Briefly, two multiplex PCR were carried out in each patient. Multiplex A contained primers for SRY and ZFX/ZFY genes and for AZF a, b, and c regions (sY86, sY127, and sY254, respectively). A second multiplex PCR was performed to reinforce diagnostic accuracy. This multiplex contained a second set of primers for AZF a, b, and c regions (sY84, sY134, and sY255, respectively), in addition to primers for SRY and ZFX/ZFY genes. In parallel to the patient\u2019s DNA sample, a DNA sample from a normal male with normal spermatogenesis and a female were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. A water sample was also run as a control for reagent contamination. Cystic fibrosis screening was made by a commercial kit of CFTR analysis (Devyser; HQ, H\u00e4gersten, Sweden). Cytogenetic analyses were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes by GTG\u0002banded metaphases at a resolution of about 550 bands according to standard laboratory protocol using Chromosome Kit P (Euroclone, Siziano PV, Italy). Normally, 20 metaphases were counted. 3. Results 3.1. Case Presentation The proband, a 36 year-old male German patient presented in our outpatient clinic for renal evaluation in April 2016.

However, the prediction of future eGFR based on Mayo imaging classification determined and esti\u0002mated ESRD at 48 years old. No liver cysts were appreciated (Figure 1B). The patient also had a saccular cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery measur- Genes 2022, 13, 394 5 of 14 ing 11 \u00d7 5 mm, that we established by MRI angiography and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) angiography and arteriography (Figure 1C). An intent of embolization resulted in failure, and he denied surgical intervention of the aneurysm. He was mar\u0002ried but without offspring. Due to couple infertility, the patient also underwent urologic evaluation in our Centre, which confirmed epididymal cysts and diagnosed azoospermia. Indeed, he had increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) (24.70 IU/L; normal range: 1.50\u20139.30 IU/L) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (60.12 IU/L; normal range: 1.40\u201318.10 IU/L) with normal prolactin (15.66 ng/mL; normal range: 2.10\u201317.70 ng/mL) and total testosterone (4.49 ng/mL; normal range: 1.65\u20137.53 ng/mL), but low free testos\u0002terone levels (12.30 pg/mL; normal range: 15.0\u201350.0 pg/mL). His triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin T4, and thyroid stimulating (TSH) hormones, and vitamin-D (48 ng/mL; normal range: 30\u2013100 ng/mL) levels were normal, but parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (levels (169 pg/mL; normal range: 18.5\u201388.0 pg/mL) were increased. Bone mineral density examination also showed marked osteoporosis. A control CT cerebral angiography per\u0002formed 18 months after the first observation (at 38 years old) revealed that the cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery had increased up to 11.9 \u00d7 5.3 mm. At 42 years old, his serum creatinine level was 5.4 mg/dL and eGFR was 12 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 1). Several intents of treatment with a low dose of Telmisartan (10 mg/daily) resulted in hypotension and were discontinued. Table 1. Evolution of electrolytes and renal function on the proband.

Follow-Up Study Since genetic studies showed a likely pathogenic missense mutation in PKD1 in het\u0002erozygosis, we classified the patient as PROPKD 4 score (low risk of progression) [36] and Mayo class 1B (low risk of progression). However, his TKV and htTKV values were significantly smaller than two of our PKD1 cohorts used to monitor our proband (PKD1 patients \u2264 40 years, and PKD1 with BMI < 25), but not smaller than PKD1 without hy\u0002pertension (Table 2). In fact, eGFR in the proband was significantly lower than the three PKD1 cohorts, according with his prediction of future eGFR (ESRD at 48 years, high risk of progression). Moreover, Table 1 shows that the patient experimented a rapid progression from CRF to ESRD in only four years. Interestingly, the proband had no clinical features related to GS, at all. He showed that the serum magnesium (1.6\u20132.0 mg/dL) and potassium levels (3.9\u20134.7 mmol/L), and venous (pH 7.31\u20137.41) were within normal limits, although HCO3- levels in blood were inappropriately higher (24\u201331 mmol/L) for his grade of CRF (Table 1). It is remarkable that during the follow-up course his blood pressure remained normal to low, despite the presence of severe CRF, including ESRD; he also had an intolerance to telmisartan treatment.

Fertility Studies Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood showed a 47, XY,+X karyotype (Figure 1D). Y-chromosome microdeletion analysis and variant analysis of the CFTR gene were negative. 3.3.2. NGS Studies NGS studies detected a previously described missense variant in PKD1; NM_001009944.3:c.9499A>T(p.Ile3167Phe) (Figure 1E, left) in heterozygosis at exon 27. This variant was reported in different ethnicities [12,37\u201339], including European Non\u0002Finnish (although in the latter ones, with a population frequency under the threshold established for nonpathogenic variants; source, Varsome). It was previously classified as a variant of uncertain significance VUS (http://pkdb.mayo.edu/ (accessed on 14 December 2021); ADPKD mutation database), and as a disease (Uniprot), which re\u0002flect conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (ClinVar), as well as VUS (LOVD), VUS (HGMD), and, following ACMG/AMP 2 criteria [40], it is likely pathogenic (LP) (PM1, PP2, PP3, PP4, PP5, BS2). In addition, we detected a second PKD1 missense variant NM_001009944.3:c.9756G>C(p.Glu3252Asp) (Figure 1E, right) in heterozygosis at exon 29, that was not previously reported in known databases (Mayo, Uniprot, ClinVar, LOVD, ALAMUT), nor in gnomAD research projects. It was classified using ACM/AMP 2 criteria as VUS (PM2, PP2, PP3). Both variants were validated by Sanger sequencing in the proband. In addition, NGS analysis also established two SLC12A3 variants, NM_000339.3:c.1928C>T (p.Pro643Leu) (Figure 1F, left) in exon 16 and NM_000339.3:c.2891G>A(p.Arg964Gln) (Figure 1F, right) in exon 25, associated with GS. Both SNVs were previously described in clinical databases (p.Pro643Leu: ClinVar; conflicting interpretation of pathogenicity; LOVD, LP; Uniprot, disease; Varsome, LP/pathogenic (P) and p.Arg964Gln: ClinVar; LP/P; LOVD, P; Varsome, LP, P) and classified under ACMG/AMP 2 criteria as LP and P, respectively. Both variants were also confirmed by Sanger sequencing only in the proband (no other members of the family were available at this time). Thus, we cannot establish familial segregation for those and previous variants. No other pathogenic variants were found in other ADPKD-associated genes (PKDH1, GANAB, ACE, etc,) or related to cyst progression. The analysis of CNV by means of MLPA for PKD1, and PKD2, and the rest of the panel (using the algorithm Lacon v1.2 tool; INGEMM) was negative. Genetic findings are shown in Table 3.

Discussion 4.1. ADPKD In ADPKD, the uncontrolled growth of renal cysts increases renal volume and the destruction of the parenchyma progressively, resulting in renal failure in most patients [41]. In addition, endothelial dysfunction which occurs very early in the course of the disease appears to be involved in increased oxidative stress and inflammation [42,43]. Then, the progression of ADPKD is highly variable, in part because of the gene affected [1\u20137], as well as the presence of other variants modifying its effect. In fact, how environmental factors and/or modifier genes/variants may modulate ADPKD, involving a rapid progression of the disease [6\u20138,13,44,45], is still unknown. Indeed, the presence of additional gene variants may promote cystogenesis and/or fibrosis, and potentiate the advancement toward ESRD [4\u20138,14]. At this point, there is some evidence of how synergistic effects between PKD1 and PKD2 loci may accelerate the progression to ESRD approximately 20 years earlier than patients with only PKD1 sequence variants [6,7]. Cyst growth in ADPKD is associated with increases in epithelial cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and fluid secretion. Then, the enlargement of cysts affects surround\u0002ing nephrons interrupts kidney function significantly [36,41,44]. Indeed, cyst pressure induces renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and kidney hypoxia. At the late stage of ADPKD, cyst formation is always accompanied by extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis formation [14,15,41], which reduces renal function and eventu\u0002ally leads to progression to ESRD [14,41]. In addition, oxidative stress/reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ADPKD has also been considered a new player and/or early predictor for such disease progression [46,47], either directly, starting endothelial dysfunction and generating arterial atherosclerosis, or weakening of the arterial medial layer leading to arterial aneurysms [48]. Therefore, ADPKD can also be related to extra-renal manifestations, such as symptomatic extra-renal cysts, hypertension, and subarachnoid hemorrhage from intracranial aneurysms [49,50]. Interestingly, we classified our proband as low risk of progression (Mayo class 1B and PROPKD 4 score), however, the eGFR predicted established the development of ESRD at 48 years (rapid progression). In fact, his real situation of ESRD had been achieved at age of 40 (eGFR 16 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) or 42 years (eGFR 12 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). Furthermore, his eGFR was significantly lower than expected when it was compared with three differ\u0002ent age-matched ADPKD cohorts, one with similar htTKV (Table 2). Thus, we suggest the predominant expression of renal tubulointerstitial inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and/or vascular disease over cyst growth in this patient. It may explain the discordance observed between different markers of risk of ADPKD progression and between htTKV and eGFR evolution. Genes 2022, 13, 394 8 of 14 4.2. Klinefelter Syndrome The presence of more than one X-chromosome in men characterized KS, which is the most common genetic cause of human male infertility. KS is related to high comorbidity with a lower life expectancy. It is thought that overexpression of some genes on the extra X-chromosome may be the cause. However, what genes and how they interact remain unclear [51\u201354]. We know that KS individuals may have an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [18], an aspect that could affect the severity of the extra-renal complications in our patient. Due to the Lyonization phenomenon, in KS individuals only one of the X-chromosomes in the somatic cells is fully active, although around 15% of the genes on the inactive X-chromosome continue to be expressed, albeit at a lower level. Thus, recent works, focused on identifying those gene clusters that escape from X-inactivation in KS patients, have revealed altered functionality in KS by several protein complexes grouped by clusters [53]. Among those clusters, one of the most significant comorbidity clusters includes PKD1 [53]. In addition, KS can lead to structural alterations in tissues [16] in different ways, including heart diseases, insulin resistance [18], thrombotic events, or subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial saccular aneurysm rupture [20,21,55]. These facts could affect the process of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [24]. The association of KS with other disorders is expected due to the relatively high frequency of this entity [56]. 4.3. Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism Male ADPKD patients may present with several reproductive system abnormalities and infertility [57\u201359]. Patients with KS usually show gonadal dysfunction with increased FSH and LH levels. Similar hormonal dysfunction was often found in male patients with CRF of any etiology [60]. So, CRF is associated with an increase in the FSH and the LH levels due to the impairment of the renal function in catabolizing these hormones, with normalization after renal transplantation [60]. Consequently, if a patient has these two conditions (KS and CRF from ADPKD) at the same time, the presence of an increase in the FSH and the LH levels, which are seen in CRF, can overlap with the KS manifestations masking and leaving the KS undiagnosed. This case illustrates an under-recognized lag in the diagnosis of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, since the superposition of the two events is rare (decrease in free testosterone and increase in FSH and LH levels), indicating that in addition to KS, this effect may be caused by coexisting CRF. 4.4. Gitelman Syndrome GS caused by SLC12A3 sequence variations is characterized by hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, RAAS activation with normal or low blood pressure, salt loss, and hypokalemia [27]. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC12A3 is necessary for establishing the diagnosis of GS. NGS showed two previously reported heterozygous mis\u0002sense variants in the SLC12A3 gene: c.1928C>T(p.Pro643Leu) and c.2891G>A(p.Arg964Gln). However, we have not found electrolyte alterations characteristic of GS in our proband. Thus, the phenotypic effect of such missense variants is difficult to evaluate, and some pathogenic variants may not be sufficient to cause phenotypic changes related to GS [27\u201331], although, we cannot rule out that modifier genes are involved in the onset of GS or that phenotypic changes caused by this compound heterozygous would be apparent later in life. Indeed, our proband had a reduced eGFR at the time of the first evaluation, and this fact could in part mask the electrolyte alterations of GS (Table 1). 4.5. Co-Occurrence of ADPKD, KS, and GS We describe the first report of ADPKD combined with KS and GS, which initially were unnoticed, indicating the need to consider the concurrent existence of additional disorders in cases of atypical ADPKD manifestations. This patient carries clinically significant vari\u0002ants in two different genes and a huge genomic rearrangement (one extra X-chromosome) responsible for additional pathology. Therefore, all these entities in one individual are not Genes 2022, 13, 394 9 of 14 common, but it depends on the prevalence of each disease. Taking into account that their prevalences are around one in 500\u20131000 (ADPKD) [3,4] and one in 500\u20131000 (KS) male births [16,17], respectively, the probability for the simultaneous occurrence of these two disorders is approximately 1/250,000\u20131,000,000 births. Therefore, the occurrence of both ADPKD and KS in a single individual is in fact, theoretically, very rare. The prevalence of GS is estimated at approximately 1:40,000 [27]. Then, the occurrence of ADPKD, KS, and GS is even a rarer event. The effects of two or more genetic disorders in the same patient are unknown, and they can be additives, protectives, or neutrals [61], and may be influenced by the extent to which the clinical features with each individual disease overlaps with the other. Thus, the diseases can be distinct or overlapping. Distinct effects may affect different organ systems, whereas overlapping clinical effects are more likely to be caused by two genes encoding for proteins that normally interact within the same signaling pathway. Since ADPKD in association with KS and GS has never been reported in the literature, the possible effect of each other is currently unknown. Therefore, at this point, it is not clear if KS and GS will affect the cyst progression of ADPKD or vice versa. Indeed, the severe ADPKD phenotype denoted in our patient can be a consequence of two, not so strong variants in PKD1 gene associated with other genetic variants (two SLC12A3 variants and an extra X-chromosome). In addition, we cannot rule out that the PKD1 variant c.9756G>C may have a role as a hypomorphic allele [11,12], or may occur from a putative alteration of topological chromatin organization (TAD; topologically associating domains). We now know that enhancers regulate the expression of distal target genes via long-range regulatory chromatin loops within the genomic context of TADs [62]. The later hypothesis needs to be also explored. The clinical progression to ESRD and disease prognosis in this patient with ADPKD, KS, and GS (isolated KS or GS not producing CRF) could be potentially synergistic and comparable to individuals with variants in both PKD1 and PKD2 [6,7], hypomorphic PKD1 variants and likely biallelic disease [12], the contiguous gene syndrome TSC2-PKD1 [8], co-occurrence of ADPKD and hereditary renal hypouricemia [45], or dual sequence variants in PKD2 and COL4A1 [63]. In fact, our patient with an LP variant in PKD1, KS, and a compound heterozygous GS-associated variant showed a severe phenotype of ADPKD, characterized by the development of early CRF (at 27 years old) and rapid evolution to ESRD (at 40 years old) (Table 1), associated with an intracranial aneurysm (Figure 1C). He developed ESRD 15\u201320 years earlier than patients with a P/LP variant in PKD1 (average age of 58 years) [4,24,37,38]. Indeed, our patient also carries features that are atypical for ADPKD, such as the development of early CRF without severe hypertension and quick evolution to ESRD, typically associated with significant cyst burden. However, he only manifested moderate ADPKD by kidney length. This fact suggests a putative effect of modifier genes with a predominant development of fibrosis over cyst growth, as has been demonstrated in a TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrosis murine model [64,65]. Therefore, discordance between cyst burden and renal function decline trajectories that could be explained by lower cyst growth and remarkably slowed kidney enlargement in this ADPKD patient. In the present study, it was hypothesized that coexisting ADPKD with masked KS and GS may have a synergistic effect on the stimulation of rapid evolution to ESRD, and their synergistic effect may be the result of regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including vascular disease [66\u201373] (see Figure 2). On the other hand, in both ADPKD and KS there is an elevated frequency of intracra\u0002nial aneurysms and, in the case of associated variants in PKD1 protein and KS, it is expected to have at least additive intracranial aneurysms in disease presentation [21,49,50,55]. Thus, inferred by our data, he appears to be more severely affected than is typically reported with either condition alone. In fact, we detected an intracranial aneurysm with increased growth in a short period of time. Thus, the presence of an additive/synergistic effect may be explained by the underlying molecular function of the polycystin-1 protein and KS. Indeed, it has been previously established that loss of polycystin-1 function reduces control of Ras and aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. Moreover, activation of the Genes 2022, 13, 394 10 of 14 mTOR pathway and increased vascular endothelial apoptosis in KS [66] and ADPKD could affect the intracranial aneurysm growth in our patient [23,24,67]. Finally, other possible factors that could affect ADPKD progression and the growth of the intracranial aneurysm in this patient include also an increased RAAS stimulation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and vascular disease [26,27,68].

On the other hand, in both ADPKD and KS there is an elevated frequency of intra\u0002cranial aneurysms and, in the case of associated variants in PKD1 protein and KS, it is  expected to have at least additive intracranial aneurysms in disease presentation  [21,49,50,55].

Thus, the presence of an addi\u0002tive/synergistic effect may be explained by the underlying molecular function of the pol\u0002ycystin-1 protein and KS. Indeed, it has been previously established that loss of polycys\u0002tin-1 function reduces control of Ras and aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. More\u0002over, activation of the mTOR pathway and increased vascular endothelial apoptosis in KS  [66] and ADPKD could affect the intracranial aneurysm growth in our patient [23,24,67]. Finally, other possible factors that could affect ADPKD progression and the growth of the  intracranial aneurysm in this patient include also an increased RAAS stimulation, apop\u0002tosis, fibrosis, and vascular disease [26,27,68]. 5. Conclusions  We present, for the first time a young ADPKD patient with an early, fast progression  to ESRD, as well as growth of an intracranial aneurysm, accompanied with masqueraded  KS and GS. We think that the presence of a 47, XXY karyotype and compound heterozy\u0002gous variants in SLC12A3 may increase the pathogenic action of PKD1 variants. This is  done, we presume, by increasing apoptosis, fibrosis, and producing predominant tubule\u2013 interstitial and vascular renal injury, instead of cystic growth, as it has been suggested in  murine models. The use of NGS in the genetic diagnosis of different diseases is currently  demonstrating the coexistence of several genetic variants in the same patient, which may  contribute to the high variability and heterogeneity observed in numerous individuals.  This case illustrates the importance of performing genetic testing to establish a complete  diagnosis in ADPKD patients with atypical presentations and/or with fertility abnormal\u0002ities.

Endovascular Approach to Acute Superior Mesenteric Artery Thrombosis Associated with Progesterone Use. Journal of Clinical Interventional Radiology. 2022;6(3):229-30 on 11 Jan 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from India and concerns a 51-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of superior mesenteric artery thrombosis and acute bowel ischemia associated with progesterone. The patient with a history of progesterone consumption for delayed menstrual cycles and menorrhagia, presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and a 1-day history of constipation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed near-total occlusion of 4.4 cm of the superior mesenteric artery from its origin. Subsequently, Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) confirmed the thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery and at the same setting, thromboaspiration was performed. Residual-narrowing was noted in the post aspiration angiogram. After 2 days of intensive care unit (ICU) care, a repeat CT angiography showed recanalization of the superior mesenteric artery for a short segment with severe luminal narrowing by eccentric plaque, and non-enhancing bowel thinning was observed in the jejunum indicating ischemia, minimal ascites, and a bulky uterus. The patient was put on antiplatelet drugs and a balloon expanding stent placement was performed without any complication. However, postprandial abdominal pain continued, this led to the termination of clopidogrel and scheduling of explorative laparotomy. A 10-cm distal ileal loop and 20-cmjejunal loop were found ischemic that were resected, and an end-to end anastomosis was performed. Several cases of mesenteric venous thrombosis occurring in patients using progesterone pills have been reported. However, arterial thrombosis in patients using progesterone is uncommon. In this case, the woman was consuming progesterone and was scheduled for dilation and curettage when she developed SMA thrombosis. Diagnosis of SMA thrombosis is difficult due to nonspecific and vague symptoms. Thrombotic occlusion of the artery is known to have an overall mortality rate of 77.4% compared with embolic occlusion that has a mortality rate of 54.1%. Laparotomy may be done to have a second look at the condition of the intestine, identify viable loops, and resect the infarcted bowel. Arterial thrombosis in patients on progesterone pills is rare, it is important to consider this in patients presenting with acute bowel ischemia. Follow-up information has been requested. Follow-up received on 27 Jan 2023: Additional information added following receipt of author\u2019s response. The patient had a BMI of 26. The patient\u2019s weight was 69 kg and height was 162 cm. The superior mesenteric artery thrombosis and acute bowel ischemia started 14 days after the taking Progesterone tablets for the same duration. Oral Norethisterone acetate 15mg (given was the generic name and not the name of any company or brand). The patient was asked to stop taking the drug after being diagnosed. The signs and symptoms improved after procedures. The patient had multiple follow-ups. The patient had recovered and there had not been any sequelae. The patient had no history of smoking, alcohol, drug interaction or hypersensitivity. INDICATION NORETHISTERONE ACETATE: 10027336 (25.1) delayed menstrual cycles INDICATION PROGESTRONE We would like to report the case of superior mesenteric arterial thrombosis in a woman with a history of progester\u0002one intake. A 51-year-old woman with a history of proges\u0002terone consumption for delayed menstrual cycles and menorrhagia, presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and a 1-day history of constipation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed near-total occlu\u0002sion of 4.4 cm of the superior mesenteric artery from its origin (\u25baFig. 1). Subsequently, Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) con\u0002firmed the thrombosis of the superior mesenteric artery (\u25baFig. 2A) and at the same setting, thromboaspiration was performed (\u25baFig. 2B). Residual-narrowing was noted in the post aspiration angiogram (\u25baFig. 2C). After 2 days of inten\u0002sive care unit (ICU) care, a repeat CT angiography showed recanalization of the superior mesenteric artery for a short segment with severe luminal narrowing by eccentric plaque, and non-enhancing bowel thinning was observed in the jejunum indicating ischemia, minimal ascites, and a bulky uterus (\u25baFig. 3A).

This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from India and concerns an adult male patient (case 1), who experienced a non-serious adverse reaction of intraocular pressure raised associated with dexamethasone. The patient 51-year-old (Current age) male with a history of hypertension since 15 years had central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with macular edema (ME) in the right eye. He had undergone 14 intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections (10 intravitreal injection (IVI) ranibizumab, 2 IVI bevacizumab, 2 IVI aflibercept) and one dose of dexamethasone implant over 4 years. Raised IOP was noted after the dexamethasone implant, which was controlled with topical antiglaucoma medications. His last injection (IVI aflibercept) was given with minimal response, 3 months prior to receiving intravitreal brolucizumab (BRZ). His BCVA was 20/100 with a CMT of 826 \u00b5m on SD-OCT. He was administered IV BRZ in the right eye. Subsequently, his BCVA improved to 20/80 at week 4 and 20/63 at weeks 8, 12, and 16, respectively. The SD-OCT showed a significant reduction of fluid till week 12. However, at 16 weeks, the BCVA was 20/100, and there was an increase in the intraretinal fluid for which the patient received a second dose of IVI BRZ. Following the second IVI BRZ, the patient was reviewed after 1 week, 4 weeks, and also 8 weeks. There was no recurrence of fluid noted till the last follow-up at 8 weeks following the 2nd IVI BRZ. The IOP was normal at all visits, and no intraocular inflammation (IOI) was noted. The patients had received dexamethasone implant with the subsequent rise of intraocular pressure (IOP). Injections were performed in an operating theater under a sterile technique. Povidone-iodine 5% was applied to the eyes both immediately before and after each injection, preoperative antibiotic eye drops were not given, but topical moxifloxacin 0.5% was administered postoperatively for 1 week. The patients were followed up on the second day after injection and at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively. At all visits, a detailed history was taken by the treating physician regarding the occurrence of any ocular and systemic adverse event. Additionally, at each follow-up visit, the patient underwent a detailed clinical examination by a retina specialist including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment using the Snellen\u2019s visual acuity chart, IOP measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometer, anterior segment evaluation using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus examination with both slit-lamp biomicroscopy (+90D lens) and indirect ophthalmoscopy (+20D lens). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed at all visits from week 4 to week 16. Repeat IVI BRZ was planned based on the pro re nata (PRN) regimen. Follow-up information has been requested. Introduction Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection is today  the gold standard for management of chorioretinal vascular diseases, including age-related  macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion  (RVO) [1]. Four anti-VEGF molecules have been approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis\u0002tration (FDA) for intraocular use, including pegaptanib sodium (Macugen\u00ae; Eyetech/OSI  Received: July 1, 2022 Accepted: August 13, 2022 Published online: November 17, 2022 Correspondence to:  Debdulal Chakraborty, devdc.dr@gmail.com www.karger.com/cop This article is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License  (CC BY-NC) (http://www.karger.com/Services/OpenAccessLicense).

Of these agents, BRZ is the  latest to receive approval in 2019 for the treatment of neovascular AMD (nAMD). In India, the  drug was launched in October 2020 as Pagenax\u00ae (Novartis India Ltd, Mumbai, India) The 96-week results from the phase 3 clinical trials, HAWK and HARRIER, have demon\u0002strated the noninferiority of BRZ to aflibercept in visual outcomes while achieving superior  anatomical outcomes with quarterly (q12-week) dosing in the management of nAMD [5].  Likewise, two phase 3 clinical trials, KESTREL and KITE, evaluated the noninferiority of  BRZ 6 mg to aflibercept 2 mg in terms of functional and morphological improvement for  management of DME [6]. BRZ showed robust visual gains and anatomical improvements with  an overall favorable benefit/risk profile in patients with DME [7]. The results of this trial  subsequently lead to approval of BRZ by US FDA for DME in June 2022 [8]. Here we describe  the safety and efficacy of IVI BRZ in two eyes with recalcitrant macular edema (ME) following  central RVO (CRVO) over 16 weeks in a real-world scenario. Both eyes had undergone multiple  intravitreal injections (IVIs) of anti-VEGF were switched to IVI BRZ. Both patients had also  received dexamethasone implant with subsequent rise of intraocular pressure (IOP). Written  informed consent was obtained from each patient. Injections were performed in an operating  theater under sterile technique. Povidone-iodine 5% was applied to eyes both immediately  before and after each injection, preoperative antibiotic eye drops were not given, but topical  moxifloxacin 0.5% was administered postoperatively for 1 week. The patients were followed  up on the second day after injection and at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively. At all visits,  a detailed history was taken by the treating physician regarding the occurrence of any ocular  and systemic adverse event. Additionally, at each follow-up visit, the patients underwent a  detailed clinical examination by a retina specialist including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  assessment using the Snellen\u2019s visual acuity chart, IOP measurement by Goldmann appla\u0002nation tonometer, anterior segment evaluation using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus  examination with both slit-lamp biomicroscopy (+90D lens) and indirect ophthalmoscopy  (+20D lens). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed at  all visits from week 4 to week 16. Repeat IVI BRZ was planned based on pro re nata (PRN)  regimen. Findings Case 1 A 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension since 15 years had CRVO with ME in the  right eye (Fig. 1a).

He was administered IV BRZ in the right eye. Subsequently, his BCVA improved  to 20/80 at week 4 and 20/63 at weeks 8, 12, and 16, respectively. The SD-OCT showed signif\u0002icant reduction of fluid till week 12 (Fig. 2b\u2013d). However, at 16 weeks, the BCVA was 20/100,  and there was an increase in the intraretinal fluid (Fig. 2e) for which the patient received  second dose of IVI BRZ. Following the second IVI BRZ, the patient was reviewed after 1 week,  4 weeks, and also 8 weeks. There was no recurrence of fluid noted till last follow-up at 8 weeks  following 2nd IVI BRZ.

Karger AG, Basel Case 2 A 48-year-old male with hypertension having CRVO with ME in the left eye (Fig. 3) had  received 12 IVI ranibizumab and 3 afibercept and 2 dexamethasone over 3 years. He had a  history of raised IOP following the second dexamethasone implant which was controlled with  antiglaucoma medications. The last injection of aflibercept was given 2 months prior to  receiving IVI BRZ. There was minimal response to the last dose of IVI aflibercept, with his  BCVA being 20/120 and CMT 811 \u00b5m on SD-OCT. The SD-OCT showed presence of gross  edema (Fig. 4a). The patient was shifted to IVI BRZ. Consecutively, his BCVA improved and  was maintained at 20/80 over 16 weeks. Simultaneously, we noted complete resolution of  fluid on SD-OCT at all the visit through 12 weeks (Fig. 4b\u2013d) with a notable reduction in the  CMT. Early recurrence of intraretinal fluid was seen at week 16 (Fig. 4e) for which the patient  was advised the second IVI BRZ. The patient received the 2nd injection of IVI BRZ and subse\u0002quently came for checkup at 1 week and 4 weeks. There was no recurrence of fluid noted on  SD-OCT at last follow-up. The patient did not show any evidence of IOI till last follow-up. Discussion In our real-world case series, we demonstrate that IVI BRZ is efficacious in improving and  maintaining the visual acuity through week 16 for recalcitrant ME secondary to CRVO.  Excellent anatomical response was noted on SD-OCT lasting up to 12 weeks with a single dose  of BRZ in both cases. However, early recurrence of fluid was seen at week 16 in both eyes for  which the second dose of injection was injected. We did not note any ocular or systemic  adverse events in these 2 patients. CRVO is a global health concern. It is estimated to affect 2.5 million people worldwide;  its age- and sex-standardized prevalence is 0.8 per 1,000 people [9]. Notably, VEGF levels  observed in CRVO cases are among the highest in all retinal disorders, and ME is the most  frequent cause of vision loss in those who have the disease [10, 11]. Anti-VEGF treatment is  effective for treating ME secondary to CRVO. However, despite aggressive treatment with anti\u0002VEGF agents, a subset of ME patients continue to exhibit suboptimal visual and anatomical  response. Such nonresponders or poor responders having recalcitrant ME may benefit by  switching to an alternative anti-VEGF agent or corticosteroids [10, 11]. Many of these patients  need frequent and repeated IVIs, leading to the burden of frequent clinic visits for IVIs \u2013 which  is both stressful and inconvenient [12]. BRZ prolonged suppression of VEGF may ensure  Fig. 3. Fundus image of case 2.

Karger AG, Basel extension of treatment intervals in many patients to 12 weeks or more without compromising  the VA gains. The new anti-VEGF agent BRZ is yet to be evaluated for nonresponsive cases of ME secondary  to CRVO, but data from the literature have supported its role as an effective anti-VEGF agent  for poorly responsive nAMD and DME [5\u20137]. A possible reason for this could be related to  its higher molar dose and/or causing inhibition of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (ranibizumab  causes inhibition of only VEGFR2) [5\u20138]. Based on these factors and its evolving role as  an effective agent for switching anti-VEGF therapy in nonresponsive nAMD, we utilized and  performed an initial analysis of the role of IVI BRZ in recalcitrant ME secondary to CRVO. BRZ is a humanized single chain antibody fragment weighing just 26 kDa. Due to its smaller  size, it binds to VEGF-A in 2:1 ratio initially, which may reduce to 1:1 with decreased concen\u0002tration of the drug [13\u201315]. However, even at 1:1 ratio, a complete blockage of VEGF-A is  maintained by BRZ [15]. Additionally, with a low-molecular weight of BRZ, which is 4 times  lower than aflibercept and 1.8 times lower than ranibizumab, it is possible to deliver a 12-fold  higher molar dose as compared to aflibercept and 22-fold higher molar dose as compared  a b c e d Fig. 4. Case 2 \u2013 a Spectral domain optical  coherence tomography (SD-OCT) image at base\u0002line showing significant intraretinal fluid (IRF)  with subretinal fluid (SRF). After undergoing  intravitreal injection (IVI) BRZ treatment, there  was complete resolution of SRF with notable  reduction in IRF on SD-OCT at week 4 (b), week  8 (c), and week 12 (d). At week 16, the SD-OCT  showed early recurrence of SRF with minimal  increase in IRF (e). Case Rep Ophthalmol 2022;13:921\u2013928 926 Chakraborty et al.: Brolucizumab in Recalcitrant CRVO www.karger.com/cop DOI: 10.1159/000526710 \u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel with ranibizumab [15\u201317]. With these molecular characteristics, BRZ has been shown to have  longer durability in the initial trials on nAMD. In the first trial in humans, SEE study, the  median time for repeat injection was 30 days longer with 3 mg and 6 mg of BRZ as compared  to ranibizumab [17]. In the phase II OSPREY trial, approximately 50% of eyes treated with  BRZ maintained stable visual acuity with q12w dosing schedule [18]. Likewise, in the phase  3 HAWK and HARRIER trials, around 50% of patients were maintained on q12w dosing up  to 48 weeks [5, 16]. Of these eyes, around 75% continued successfully on q12w injection  interval up to 96 weeks [5]. Although a 12-weekly regimen of IVI BRZ would have been ideal  in our series, the patients were offered PRN regimen, considering their socioeconomic profile  and affordability. Both cases demonstrated encouraging visual acuity improvement that was maintained  up to 12 weeks after a single dose of IVI BRZ. In addition, reduction in the CMT and fluid was  observed in both cases over 12 weeks. The significant anatomical and tomographic response  of these recalcitrant ME eyes to a single dose of IVI BRZ could be due to distinct pharmacoki\u0002netics and pharmacodynamics of the BRZ molecule and tachyphylaxis to the previous molecule  due to neutralizing antibodies, altered surface receptor expression, macrophage mediated  upregulation of VEGF, and/or altered pharmacokinetics [5, 16, 17]. Further molecular and  immunological studies are warranted to rationalize the mechanism of action and validate the  encouraging therapeutic response seen after switching to IVI BRZ in recalcitrant DME. IVI BRZ  has been associated with IOI. The incidence of IOI in the HAWK and HARRIER studies was 4%  for BRZ as compared to 1% for aflibercept [5]. The American Society of Retinal Specialists had  issued an alert in February 2020 after 14 cases of retinal vasculitis, of which 11 were occlusive  vasculitis, were reported after use of IVI BRZ [19]. The \u201cIRIS Registry and Komodo Healthcare  Map\u201d data published recently are the largest data so far, on safety of IVI BRZ, in real-world  nAMD. They noted an IOI rate of 2.9% in eyes with nAMD [20]. Our group published data on use of BRZ in wet AMD and recalcitrant DME in Indian eyes  where we did not find any inflammation with the use of BRZ [21\u201323]. Recently, Novartis  terminated the RAPTOR for branch RVO and RAVEN for CRVO trials in which BRZ was dosed  at 4-weekly interval due to high incidence of IOI in both groups, in the interest of patient safety  [24]. Novartis has further emphasized that after three loading doses given at 4 weekly  intervals, the subsequent doses of BRZ should not be given with less than 8-week interval [25].  The FALCON study which is underway may help us understand whether a 12-week extension  from the initiation will be of some help in reducing the immunogenic potential of this effi\u0002cacious molecule [26]. In the current real-world series of two eyes with recalcitrant CRVO, we have followed a PRN  regimen with IVI BRZ. While the efficacy in controlling edema was noted, we did not observe any  incident of anterior or posterior segment inflammation during the follow-up period. Additionally,  no patients reported any systemic adverse event. However, our series is too small with a short  follow-up. And hence, it is insufficiently powered to determine the risks of systemic adverse events.  The major limitations of this study include the small number of cases and brief follow-up period. Conclusion In our real-world case series, we noted an improvement in visual acuity and resolution  of fluid in eyes with recalcitrant CRVO with IVI BRZ. The anatomical improvement persists up  to 12 weeks after a single dose, with early recurrence of fluid noted at 16 weeks allowing for  a PRN regimen in these eyes. The results of these 2 cases, however, need to be validated by  larger prospective studies, and BRZ should remain a drug of last resort for eye with recalcitrant  CRVO in the current scenario of heightened safety concerns.

A successful case of electrical storm rescue after acute myocardial infarction. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders. 2022;22(1):537 on 15 Dec 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from China and concerns a 57-year-old male patient who experienced serious adverse reaction of prolonged QT interval associated with Amiodarone. The patient presented to the emergency department approximately two hours after the onset of chest pain. His chief complaint was severe and persistent chest pain radiating to the back, near-death feeling with associated diaphoresis, pallor, and general fatigue. He denied dyspnea on exertion, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. His past medical history includes uncontrolled hypertension and a 40-pack-year history of smoking. Importantly, there was no family history of MI or sudden death. Vitals on admission were temperature: 36.5 C, pulse: 72 beats/min, respiration rate: 20/min, blood pressure: 137/87 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and oxygen saturation: 98%. Physical examination was unremarkable for the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and nervous systems. A bedside standard 18-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, AVF, V3R-V5 R, and V7-V9. An impression of \u201cacute infero-posterior ST-segment elevation MI complicated by acute right ventricular MI\u201d was made, and dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated with 300 mg aspirin plus 180 mg ticagrelor. Initial laboratory tests were as follows: troponin I, 0.15 \u03bcg/L(reference range: 0.01-0.023 \u03bcg/L); creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, 31.7U/L(reference range: 0-20U/L); D-dimer, 258 \u03bcg/L(reference range: 80-500 \u03bcg/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 131U/L(reference range: 0-40U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 49U/L(reference range: 0-40U/L); C-reactive protein, 30.6 mg/dL(reference range: 0 -10 mg/L); serum potassium, 3.72 mmol/ L(reference range: 3.5-4.5 mmol/L); cholesterol levels, coagulation profile, renal profile, and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor were all normal. As a major acute chest pain national referral center, the cardiac catheterization room was activated for planned emergency coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI after obtaining consent from the patient and the family. CAG showed right coronary dominance, single-vessel lesion, total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA), and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of grade 0. Considering that the RCA was the occluded vessel and the importance of minimizing door-to-balloon (DTB) time, the author performed PCI immediately following CAG. The patient suddenly lost consciousness when guiding the catheter into the RCA, and ventricular fibrillation (VF) ensued. 200 J asynchronous electrical defibrillation was given immediately. Defibrillation successfully restored sinus rhythm. The second episode of VF was noted three minutes later, electric defibrillation was repeated, and 1 mg epinephrine was administered. One minute later, the third episode of VF occurred again, and a diagnosis of ES was considered. At the time of repeated electric defibrillation, multiple intravenous lines were running to maintain hemodynamic stability, electrolyte replacement (potassium and magnesium) was administered, and a loading dose of amiodarone at 150 mg intravenously followed by a maintenance dose of 1 mg/min. Esmolol was titrated at 0.5 mg/kg intravenously and maintained at 0.05-0.20 mg/kg/min through an infusion pump. Due to an impending airway compromise and patient anxiety and agitation, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed, and induced sedation was achieved with midazolam injection 0.01 mg/kg/h. Fourteen additional episodes of VF were recorded during the procedure before reverting to sinus rhythm. Vitals returned to baseline: HR: 62 bpm, BP: 108/69 mmHg, and when blood pressure dropped to 80/47 mmHg, the esmolol dosage was adjusted to 0.05 mg/kg/min and norepinephrine 0.2-0.3 \u03bcg/kg/min pump was added for maintenance. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was done for the proximal RCA within a DTB time of 72 min. CAG showed multiple thrombi in the RCA, and the erythrocyte-rich thrombus was aspirated. To reduce the thrombotic load, Tirofiban was administered intravenously with 10 \u03bcg/kg for 3 min and maintained at 0.15 \u03bcg/kg/min. Then a drug-eluting stent was implanted for RCA ostial narrowing. Stent deployment restored TIMI grade 3 flow. The patient was successfully transferred from the operating table to the cardiac care unit (CCU), and the ST-segment elevation of the patient was attenuated after the primary PCI. Esmolol, midazolam, and norepinephrine pumps were discontinued after the blood pressure stabilized. Amiodarone was also discontinued owing to its side effects leading to prolonged QT interval. Most studies have indicated that amiodarone has an excellent therapeutic effect on patients with VT after AMI but is associated with QT prolongation as its major side effect. Aspirin (100 mg once a day), ticagrelor (90 mg twice a day), pravastatin (20 mg once a night), metoprolol sustained- release tablets (47.5 mg once a day) were continued. Color Doppler echocardiography showed left atrium size (31 mm), left ventricle (40 mm), segmental right ventricular hypokinesis, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%. One week after admission, the patient was discharged without any symptoms and with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor(ACEI). Follow-up information has been requested. Follow-up received on 05-Jan-2023: Additional information added following the receipt of author\u2019s response. The patient (height 180cm weight 98kg) received amiodarone loading dose intravenously, followed by maintenance dose by intravenous pump pumping for the duration of more than 10hours. The patient developed QT interval prolongation almost two hours after initiation of amiodarone. The patient had QT interval prolongation for about 8 hours followed by a good recovery. The QT interval prolongation did not cause torsades de pointes or progress to malignant arrhythmia.", "tokens": [{"text": "57-year-old", "start": 366, "end": 377, "token_start": 78, "token_end": 82, "entityLabel": "PATIENTONSETAGE"}, {"text": "male", "start": 378, "end": 382, "token_start": 83, "token_end": 83, "entityLabel": "PATIENTSEX"}, {"text": "China", "start": 345, "end": 350, "token_start": 74, "token_end": 74, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"}, {"text": "prolonged QT interval", "start": 435, "end": 456, "token_start": 91, "token_end": 93, "entityLabel": "PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"}, {"text": "blood pressure", "start": 1071, "end": 1085, "token_start": 213, "token_end": 214, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "137/87 mmHg", "start": 1087, "end": 1098, "token_start": 216, "token_end": 219, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "Amiodarone", "start": 473, "end": 483, "token_start": 96, "token_end": 96, "entityLabel": "SUSPECTPRODUCT"}, {"text": "electrocardiogram", "start": 1290, "end": 1307, "token_start": 259, "token_end": 259, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "troponin", "start": 1634, "end": 1642, "token_start": 331, "token_end": 331, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "creatine kinase isoenzyme", "start": 1691, "end": 1716, "token_start": 356, "token_end": 358, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "D-dimer", "start": 1756, "end": 1763, "token_start": 377, "token_end": 379, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "aspartate aminotransferase", "start": 1805, "end": 1831, "token_start": 397, "token_end": 398, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "alanine aminotransferase", "start": 1867, "end": 1891, "token_start": 414, "token_end": 415, "entityLabel": "TESTNAME"}, {"text": "49U/L", "start": 1893, "end": 1898, "token_start": 417, "token_end": 419, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "258 \u03bcg/L", "start": 1765, "end": 1773, "token_start": 381, "token_end": 384, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "131U/L", "start": 1833, "end": 1839, "token_start": 400, "token_end": 402, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "0.15 \u03bcg/L", "start": 1646, "end": 1655, "token_start": 334, "token_end": 339, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "31.7U/L", "start": 1721, "end": 1728, "token_start": 361, "token_end": 365, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}, {"text": "ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, AVF, V3R-V5 R, and V7-V9", "start": 1321, "end": 1384, "token_start": 264, "token_end": 284, "entityLabel": "TESTRESULT"}], "relations": [{"child": 213, "head": 216, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 213, "head": 91, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}, {"child": 83, "head": 78, "relationLabel": "PATIENTGENDER"}, {"child": 74, "head": 78, "relationLabel": "PATIENTCOUNTRY"}, {"child": 91, "head": 96, "relationLabel": "SUSPECTREACTION"}, {"child": 96, "head": 78, "relationLabel": "PATIENTSUSPECT"}, {"child": 264, "head": 259, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 334, "head": 331, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 361, "head": 356, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 381, "head": 377, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 400, "head": 397, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 417, "head": 414, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTESTRESULT"}, {"child": 356, "head": 91, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}, {"child": 91, "head": 397, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}, {"child": 414, "head": 91, "relationLabel": "REACTIONTEST"}]}, {"document": "\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Intravitreal Injection of Brolucizumab for Recalcitrant Macular Edema due to Central Retinal Vein Occlusion: A Small Case Series. Case Reports in Ophthalmology. 2022;13(3):921-8 on 13 Jan 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from India and concerns an male patient in his 40\u2019s (case 2), who experienced a non-serious adverse reaction of intraocular pressure raised associated with dexamethasone. The patient 48 years old (Current age) with hypertension having central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with macular edema (ME) in the left eye had received 12 intravitreal injection (IVI) ranibizumab and 3 afibercept and 2 dexamethasone over 3 years. He had a history of raised intraocular pressure (IOP) following the second dexamethasone implant which was controlled with antiglaucoma medications. The last injection of aflibercept was given 2 months prior to receiving IVI BRZ. There was minimal response to the last dose of IVI aflibercept, with his BCVA being 20/120 and CMT 811 \u00b5m on SD-OCT. The SD-OCT showed the presence of gross edema. The patient was shifted to IVI brolucizumab (BRZ). Consecutively, his BCVA improved and was maintained at 20/80 over 16 weeks. Simultaneously, the physician noted complete resolution of fluid on SD-OCT at all the visit through 12 weeks with a notable reduction in the CMT. An early recurrence of intraretinal fluid was seen at week 16 for which the patient was advised the second IVI BRZ. The patient received the 2nd injection of IVI BRZ and subsequently came for a checkup at 1 week and 4 weeks. There was no recurrence of fluid noted on SD-OCT at the last follow-up. The patient did not show any evidence of IOI till the last follow-up. The patients had received dexamethasone implant with the subsequent rise of intraocular pressure (IOP). Injections were performed in an operating theater under a sterile technique. Povidone-iodine 5% was applied to the eyes both immediately before and after each injection, preoperative antibiotic eye drops were not given, but topical moxifloxacin 0.5% was administered postoperatively for 1 week. The patients were followed up on the second day after injection and at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively. At all visits, a detailed history was taken by the treating physician regarding the occurrence of any ocular and systemic adverse event. Additionally, at each follow-up visit, the patient underwent a detailed clinical examination by a retina specialist including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessment using the Snellen\u2019s visual acuity chart, IOP measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometer, anterior segment evaluation using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus examination with both slit-lamp biomicroscopy (+90D lens) and indirect ophthalmoscopy (+20D lens). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed at all visits from week 4 to week 16. Repeat IVI BRZ was planned based on the pro re nata (PRN) regimen. Follow-up information has been requested.  Abstract This was a single center, prospective uncontrolled nonrandomized case series. Two eyes with  recalcitrant ME secondary to CRVO, who have received a minimum of ten intravitreal anti\u0002vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections, underwent IVI brolucizumab (BRZ).  Patients underwent best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) testing, ophthalmic examination, and  optical coherence tomography at baseline and follow-up visits (weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16). Both  patients demonstrated notable improvement in BCVA and reduction of fluid on SD-OCT lasting  up to week 12. At week 16, though both the eyes maintained the visual acuity gains, early increase  in fluid was noted in both cases, for which second dose of IVI BRZ was given. No ocular or  systemic adverse events were noted in these 2 cases. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel Introduction Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection is today  the gold standard for management of chorioretinal vascular diseases, including age-related  macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion  (RVO) [1]. Four anti-VEGF molecules have been approved by the US Food and Drug Adminis\u0002tration (FDA) for intraocular use, including pegaptanib sodium (Macugen\u00ae; Eyetech/OSI  Received: July 1, 2022 Accepted: August 13, 2022 Published online: November 17, 2022 Correspondence to:  Debdulal Chakraborty, devdc.dr@gmail.com www.karger.com/cop This article is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License  (CC BY-NC) (http://www.karger.com/Services/OpenAccessLicense).

Of these agents, BRZ is the  latest to receive approval in 2019 for the treatment of neovascular AMD (nAMD). In India, the  drug was launched in October 2020 as Pagenax\u00ae (Novartis India Ltd, Mumbai, India) The 96-week results from the phase 3 clinical trials, HAWK and HARRIER, have demon\u0002strated the noninferiority of BRZ to aflibercept in visual outcomes while achieving superior  anatomical outcomes with quarterly (q12-week) dosing in the management of nAMD [5].  Likewise, two phase 3 clinical trials, KESTREL and KITE, evaluated the noninferiority of  BRZ 6 mg to aflibercept 2 mg in terms of functional and morphological improvement for  management of DME [6]. BRZ showed robust visual gains and anatomical improvements with  an overall favorable benefit/risk profile in patients with DME [7]. The results of this trial  subsequently lead to approval of BRZ by US FDA for DME in June 2022 [8]. Here we describe  the safety and efficacy of IVI BRZ in two eyes with recalcitrant macular edema (ME) following  central RVO (CRVO) over 16 weeks in a real-world scenario. Both eyes had undergone multiple  intravitreal injections (IVIs) of anti-VEGF were switched to IVI BRZ. Both patients had also  received dexamethasone implant with subsequent rise of intraocular pressure (IOP). Written  informed consent was obtained from each patient. Injections were performed in an operating  theater under sterile technique. Povidone-iodine 5% was applied to eyes both immediately  before and after each injection, preoperative antibiotic eye drops were not given, but topical  moxifloxacin 0.5% was administered postoperatively for 1 week. The patients were followed  up on the second day after injection and at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16, respectively. At all visits,  a detailed history was taken by the treating physician regarding the occurrence of any ocular  and systemic adverse event. Additionally, at each follow-up visit, the patients underwent a  detailed clinical examination by a retina specialist including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  assessment using the Snellen\u2019s visual acuity chart, IOP measurement by Goldmann appla\u0002nation tonometer, anterior segment evaluation using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fundus  examination with both slit-lamp biomicroscopy (+90D lens) and indirect ophthalmoscopy  (+20D lens). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) was performed at  all visits from week 4 to week 16. Repeat IVI BRZ was planned based on pro re nata (PRN)  regimen. Findings Case 1 A 51-year-old male with a history of hypertension since 15 years had CRVO with ME in the  right eye (Fig. 1a). He had undergone 14 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (10 IVI ranibizumab,  Fig. 1. Optos fundus image of case 1.

Karger AG, Basel 2 IVI bevacizumab, 2 IVI aflibercept) and one dose of dexamethasone implant over 4 years.  Raised IOP was noted after the dexamethasone implant, which was controlled with topical  antiglaucoma medications. His last injection (IVI aflibercept) was given with minimal response,  3 months prior to receiving intravitreal BRZ. His BCVA was 20/100 with a CMT of 826 \u00b5m on  SD-OCT (Fig. 2a). He was administered IV BRZ in the right eye. Subsequently, his BCVA improved  to 20/80 at week 4 and 20/63 at weeks 8, 12, and 16, respectively. The SD-OCT showed signif\u0002icant reduction of fluid till week 12 (Fig. 2b\u2013d). However, at 16 weeks, the BCVA was 20/100,  and there was an increase in the intraretinal fluid (Fig. 2e) for which the patient received  second dose of IVI BRZ. Following the second IVI BRZ, the patient was reviewed after 1 week,  4 weeks, and also 8 weeks. There was no recurrence of fluid noted till last follow-up at 8 weeks  following 2nd IVI BRZ. The IOP was normal at all visits, and no intraocular inflammation (IOI)  was noted. a b c e d Fig. 2. Case 1 \u2013 a Spectral-domain optical coher\u0002ence tomography (SD-OCT) image at baseline.

Published by S. Karger AG, Basel Case 2 A 48-year-old male with hypertension having CRVO with ME in the left eye (Fig. 3) had  received 12 IVI ranibizumab and 3 afibercept and 2 dexamethasone over 3 years. He had a  history of raised IOP following the second dexamethasone implant which was controlled with  antiglaucoma medications. The last injection of aflibercept was given 2 months prior to  receiving IVI BRZ. There was minimal response to the last dose of IVI aflibercept, with his  BCVA being 20/120 and CMT 811 \u00b5m on SD-OCT. The SD-OCT showed presence of gross  edema (Fig. 4a). The patient was shifted to IVI BRZ. Consecutively, his BCVA improved and  was maintained at 20/80 over 16 weeks. Simultaneously, we noted complete resolution of  fluid on SD-OCT at all the visit through 12 weeks (Fig. 4b\u2013d) with a notable reduction in the  CMT. Early recurrence of intraretinal fluid was seen at week 16 (Fig. 4e) for which the patient  was advised the second IVI BRZ. The patient received the 2nd injection of IVI BRZ and subse\u0002quently came for checkup at 1 week and 4 weeks. There was no recurrence of fluid noted on  SD-OCT at last follow-up. The patient did not show any evidence of IOI till last follow-up. Discussion In our real-world case series, we demonstrate that IVI BRZ is efficacious in improving and  maintaining the visual acuity through week 16 for recalcitrant ME secondary to CRVO.  Excellent anatomical response was noted on SD-OCT lasting up to 12 weeks with a single dose  of BRZ in both cases. However, early recurrence of fluid was seen at week 16 in both eyes for  which the second dose of injection was injected. We did not note any ocular or systemic  adverse events in these 2 patients. CRVO is a global health concern. It is estimated to affect 2.5 million people worldwide;  its age- and sex-standardized prevalence is 0.8 per 1,000 people [9]. Notably, VEGF levels  observed in CRVO cases are among the highest in all retinal disorders, and ME is the most  frequent cause of vision loss in those who have the disease [10, 11]. Anti-VEGF treatment is  effective for treating ME secondary to CRVO. However, despite aggressive treatment with anti\u0002VEGF agents, a subset of ME patients continue to exhibit suboptimal visual and anatomical  response. Such nonresponders or poor responders having recalcitrant ME may benefit by  switching to an alternative anti-VEGF agent or corticosteroids [10, 11]. Many of these patients  need frequent and repeated IVIs, leading to the burden of frequent clinic visits for IVIs \u2013 which  is both stressful and inconvenient [12]. BRZ prolonged suppression of VEGF may ensure  Fig. 3. Fundus image of case 2.

Karger AG, Basel extension of treatment intervals in many patients to 12 weeks or more without compromising  the VA gains. The new anti-VEGF agent BRZ is yet to be evaluated for nonresponsive cases of ME secondary  to CRVO, but data from the literature have supported its role as an effective anti-VEGF agent  for poorly responsive nAMD and DME [5\u20137]. A possible reason for this could be related to  its higher molar dose and/or causing inhibition of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (ranibizumab  causes inhibition of only VEGFR2) [5\u20138]. Based on these factors and its evolving role as  an effective agent for switching anti-VEGF therapy in nonresponsive nAMD, we utilized and  performed an initial analysis of the role of IVI BRZ in recalcitrant ME secondary to CRVO. BRZ is a humanized single chain antibody fragment weighing just 26 kDa. Due to its smaller  size, it binds to VEGF-A in 2:1 ratio initially, which may reduce to 1:1 with decreased concen\u0002tration of the drug [13\u201315]. However, even at 1:1 ratio, a complete blockage of VEGF-A is  maintained by BRZ [15]. Additionally, with a low-molecular weight of BRZ, which is 4 times  lower than aflibercept and 1.8 times lower than ranibizumab, it is possible to deliver a 12-fold  higher molar dose as compared to aflibercept and 22-fold higher molar dose as compared  a b c e d Fig. 4. Case 2 \u2013 a Spectral domain optical  coherence tomography (SD-OCT) image at base\u0002line showing significant intraretinal fluid (IRF)  with subretinal fluid (SRF). After undergoing  intravitreal injection (IVI) BRZ treatment, there  was complete resolution of SRF with notable  reduction in IRF on SD-OCT at week 4 (b), week  8 (c), and week 12 (d). At week 16, the SD-OCT  showed early recurrence of SRF with minimal  increase in IRF (e). Case Rep Ophthalmol 2022;13:921\u2013928 926 Chakraborty et al.: Brolucizumab in Recalcitrant CRVO www.karger.com/cop DOI: 10.1159/000526710 \u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel with ranibizumab [15\u201317]. With these molecular characteristics, BRZ has been shown to have  longer durability in the initial trials on nAMD. In the first trial in humans, SEE study, the  median time for repeat injection was 30 days longer with 3 mg and 6 mg of BRZ as compared  to ranibizumab [17]. In the phase II OSPREY trial, approximately 50% of eyes treated with  BRZ maintained stable visual acuity with q12w dosing schedule [18]. Likewise, in the phase  3 HAWK and HARRIER trials, around 50% of patients were maintained on q12w dosing up  to 48 weeks [5, 16]. Of these eyes, around 75% continued successfully on q12w injection  interval up to 96 weeks [5]. Although a 12-weekly regimen of IVI BRZ would have been ideal  in our series, the patients were offered PRN regimen, considering their socioeconomic profile  and affordability. Both cases demonstrated encouraging visual acuity improvement that was maintained  up to 12 weeks after a single dose of IVI BRZ. In addition, reduction in the CMT and fluid was  observed in both cases over 12 weeks. The significant anatomical and tomographic response  of these recalcitrant ME eyes to a single dose of IVI BRZ could be due to distinct pharmacoki\u0002netics and pharmacodynamics of the BRZ molecule and tachyphylaxis to the previous molecule  due to neutralizing antibodies, altered surface receptor expression, macrophage mediated  upregulation of VEGF, and/or altered pharmacokinetics [5, 16, 17]. Further molecular and  immunological studies are warranted to rationalize the mechanism of action and validate the  encouraging therapeutic response seen after switching to IVI BRZ in recalcitrant DME. IVI BRZ  has been associated with IOI. The incidence of IOI in the HAWK and HARRIER studies was 4%  for BRZ as compared to 1% for aflibercept [5]. The American Society of Retinal Specialists had  issued an alert in February 2020 after 14 cases of retinal vasculitis, of which 11 were occlusive  vasculitis, were reported after use of IVI BRZ [19]. The \u201cIRIS Registry and Komodo Healthcare  Map\u201d data published recently are the largest data so far, on safety of IVI BRZ, in real-world  nAMD. They noted an IOI rate of 2.9% in eyes with nAMD [20]. Our group published data on use of BRZ in wet AMD and recalcitrant DME in Indian eyes  where we did not find any inflammation with the use of BRZ [21\u201323]. Recently, Novartis  terminated the RAPTOR for branch RVO and RAVEN for CRVO trials in which BRZ was dosed  at 4-weekly interval due to high incidence of IOI in both groups, in the interest of patient safety  [24]. Novartis has further emphasized that after three loading doses given at 4 weekly  intervals, the subsequent doses of BRZ should not be given with less than 8-week interval [25].  The FALCON study which is underway may help us understand whether a 12-week extension  from the initiation will be of some help in reducing the immunogenic potential of this effi\u0002cacious molecule [26]. In the current real-world series of two eyes with recalcitrant CRVO, we have followed a PRN  regimen with IVI BRZ. While the efficacy in controlling edema was noted, we did not observe any  incident of anterior or posterior segment inflammation during the follow-up period. Additionally,  no patients reported any systemic adverse event. However, our series is too small with a short  follow-up. And hence, it is insufficiently powered to determine the risks of systemic adverse events.  The major limitations of this study include the small number of cases and brief follow-up period. Conclusion In our real-world case series, we noted an improvement in visual acuity and resolution  of fluid in eyes with recalcitrant CRVO with IVI BRZ. The anatomical improvement persists up  to 12 weeks after a single dose, with early recurrence of fluid noted at 16 weeks allowing for  a PRN regimen in these eyes. The results of these 2 cases, however, need to be validated by  larger prospective studies, and BRZ should remain a drug of last resort for eye with recalcitrant  CRVO in the current scenario of heightened safety concerns.

The pre\u2011operative examination was unremarkable and baseline vitals were normal. Under all aseptic precautions  and American society of anesthesiologists standard monitoring, SAB was administered with 2.2 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric  bupivacaine. Soon after administration of SAB, prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine was started at the rate of 50 \u03bcg/min;  after pre\u2011treatment with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate intravenous immediately after the start of the infusion, the patient complained  of severe headache. Blood pressure (BP) recorded at that time was 191/102 mm of Hg. Phenylephrine infusion was stopped  immediately but the BP remained high and came to within 20% of baseline value only after 9 min of discontinuing the infusion.  We report this case of refractory hypertension following phenylephrine infusion in a healthy parturient undergoing elective  cesarean section under SAB. Keywords: Glycopyrrolate, phenylephrine, refractory hypertension  This case was detected in the medical literature by the EMA MLM Service from Bansal V, Saxena KN, Wadhwa B. Refractory hypertension after phenylephrine infusion in cesarean section under subarachnoid block. Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia. 2023;17(1):107-9 on 27 Jan 2023. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from India and concerns a 21-years-old male patient, who experienced a serious adverse reaction of symptomatic refractory hypertension associated with phenylephrine, and glycopyrrolate. The parturient was posted for the elective cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation. The pre\u2011operative evaluation was unremarkable, with no comorbidity and no h/o hypertension and baseline vitals were normal. Subarachnoid block (SAB) was administered through the midline approach with 2.2 ml of heavy bupivacaine (0.5%). Soon after this, pre\u2011treatment with glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) was given intravenously and a prophylactic infusion of phenylephrine was started at the rate of 50 \u03bcg/min for prevention of subarachnoid block (SAB)\u2011induced hypotension. Within 2 min of the start of the infusion, the patient started complaining of severe headache and nausea. The blood pressure (BP) taken at that time was found to be 191/102 mm Hg. The phenylephrine infusion was stopped immediately and 2 min later BP came down to 173/102 mm Hg, and the patient's headache was relieved. Subsequent BP reading was recorded and a consistent fall in the BP reading reaching 147/101 mm Hg after 9 min of stopping the infusion was achieved, which was within 20% of baseline BP (128/76 mm Hg). There were no episodes of maternal bradycardia at any time. The rest of the surgery proceeded uneventfully and a healthy baby was delivered with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively, with a normal umbilical cord pH. The total consumption of phenylephrine during the 2 min period of infusion was 2 ml 100 \u03bcg. The patient was followed up in the post\u2011operative period and investigated for other causes of refractory hypertension. Patients who are hyperthyroid, hypertensive, or taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants might have an accelerated response even to a lower dose of phenylephrine. All relevant investigations including workup for pheochromocytoma were undertaken and none of them was found to be significant. Hypotension is the most common side effect after SAB in patients undergoing cesarean section which has serious maternal and fetal implications. Prophylactic phenylephrine infusion is considered the drug of choice for the prevention of post\u2011spinal hypotension as it is easily titrable and does not cause rebound hypo\u2011 or hypertension after discontinuing the infusion and action usually terminates within 2\u20133 min after stopping the infusion. Various doses of phenylephrine infusion from ranging 25 to 200 \u03bcg/min have been used in the parturient and episodes of hypertension following prophylactic infusion doses greater than 50 \u03bcg/min have been reported. In the current case, prophylactic phenylephrine was started at the rate of 50 \u03bcg/min, and pre\u2011treatment with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg bolus was given but even with this optimal dose the current patient developed severe headache with a sudden rise in BP lasting as long as 9 min even after discontinuing the infusion immediately in a previously healthy parturient. This was an unusual finding since the BP usually comes down to 20% of baseline values within 2\u20133 min of discontinuation of phenylephrine infusion and such episodes of hypertension have not been reported with infusion doses of 50 \u03bcg/min. The hypertensive episodes lasted for 9 min but the fetal outcome was unaffected as the umbilical cord gas analysis and Apgar scores of the baby were found to be normal and the patient was asymptomatic thereafter. Phenylephrine ampoules have a concentration of 10 mg/ml and for making a solution of 50 \u03bcg, careful serial dilutions are required, initially, the physician thought that there might have been an error in dilution and a higher dose of phenylephrine may have got administered but a careful cross\u2011check revealed that there had been no error in the dilution of the drug. The patient was followed up after the surgery to investigate for any underlying cause that may have contributed to this refractory hypertension. Patients who are hyperthyroid, hypertensive, or taking MAOIs and tricyclic antidepressants might have an accelerated response even to a lower dose of phenylephrine. All relevant investigations including workup for pheochromocytoma were undertaken and none of them was found to be significant. While episodes of hypertension have been reported with prophylactic phenylephrine, they are usually of short duration, relieved within minutes of stopping of infusion, and without maternal and fetal implications. The current patient was a healthy young patient who developed symptomatic refractory hypertension following standard prophylactic phenylephrine infusion for prevention of post\u2011spinal hypotension. Exaggerated BP might be due to a combination of phenylephrine and glycopyrrolate as the latter also have some intrinsic hypertensive properties. Refractory hypertension as seen in the current case has not been reported after phenylephrine infusion. The physician suggests that a high level of vigilance be maintained in monitoring the patient when using such infusion and a further reduction in prophylactic doses may be considered to prevent the occurrence of hypertensive episodes ensuring maternal and fetal safety. Follow-up information has been requested. Hypotension is one of the major concerns when  administering SAB in cesarean section as it significantly  impairs both maternal and fetal outcomes.[1] Prophylactic  phenylephrine infusion for the prevention of hypotension  during cesarean section is now the modality of choice. It  has potent \u03b1 receptor agonistic action without \u03b2 adrenergic  receptor activity and reduces the risk of hypotension  and fetal acidosis.[1,2] Its use is often associated with a  dose\u2011related reflexive slowing of maternal heart rate (HR)  and a corresponding decrease in cardiac output[1,3,4] which  can be attenuated or prevented by using glycopyrrolate.[5] As  placental blood flow depends on the cardiac output which  depends on stroke volume and HR. Case Report A 21\u2011year\u2011old parturient was posted for the elective  cesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation.

The phenylephrine infusion  was stopped immediately and 2 min later BP came down  to 173/102 mm Hg, and the patient headache was relieved.  Subsequent BP reading was recorded and a consistent fall  in the BP reading reaching 147/101 mm Hg after 9 min of  stopping the infusion was achieved, which was within 20%  of baseline BP (128/76 mm Hg). There were no episodes of  maternal bradycardia at any time. The rest of the surgery  proceeded uneventfully and a healthy baby was delivered  with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively,  with a normal umbilical cord pH. The total consumption of  phenylephrine during the 2 min period of infusion was 2 ml  100 \u03bcg. The parturient was followed up in the post\u2011operative  period and investigated for other causes of refractory  hypertension. Patients who are hyperthyroid, hypertensive,  or taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAOIs) and tricyclic  antidepressants might have an accelerated response even to  a lower dose of phenylephrine. All relevant investigations  including work up for pheochromocytoma were undertaken  and none of them was found to be significant. Discussion Hypotension is the most common side effect after SAB in  parturients undergoing cesarean section which has serious  maternal and fetal implications.[1] Prophylactic phenylephrine  infusion is considered the drug of choice for the prevention  of post\u2011spinal hypotension as it is easily titrable and does not  cause rebound hypo\u2011 or hypertension after discontinuing the  infusion and action usually terminates within 2\u20133 min after  stopping the infusion.[6,7] Various doses of phenylephrine  infusion from ranging 25 to 200 \u03bcg/min have been used  in the parturient and episodes of hypertension following  prophylactic infusion doses greater than 50 \u03bcg/min have  been reported.[7\u20119] In our case prophylactic phenylephrine  was started at the rate of 50 \u03bcg/min, and pre\u2011treatment  with glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg bolus was given but even with  this optimal dose our patient developed severe headache  with a sudden rise in BP lasting as long as 9 min even after  discontinuing the infusion immediately in a previously healthy  parturient. This was an unusual finding since the BP usually  comes down to 20% of baseline values within 2\u20133 min of  discontinuation of phenylephrine infusion and such episodes  of hypertension have not been reported with infusion doses  of 50 \u03bcg/min. The hypertensive episodes lasted for 9 min  but the fetal outcome was unaffected as the umbilical cord  gas analysis and Apgar scores of the baby were found to  be normal and the patient was asymptomatic thereafter.  Phenylephrine ampoules have a concentration of 10 mg/ml  and for making a solution of 50 \u03bcg, careful serial dilutions  are required, initially we thought that there might have been  an error in dilution and a higher dose of phenylephrine may  have got administered but a careful cross\u2011check revealed  that there had been no error in the dilution of the drug.  The patient was followed up after the surgery to investigate  for any underlying cause that may have contributed to this  refractory hypertension. Patients who are hyperthyroid,  hypertensive, or taking MAOIs and tricyclic antidepressants  might have an accelerated response even to a lower dose of  phenylephrine. All relevant investigations including work up  for pheochromocytoma were undertaken and none of them  was found to be significant. While episodes of hypertension have been reported with  prophylactic phenylephrine, they are usually of short  duration, relieved within minutes of stopping of infusion,  and without maternal and fetal implications.[8\u201110] Our patient  was a healthy young parturient who developed symptomatic  refractory hypertension following standard prophylactic  phenylephrine infusion for prevention of post\u2011spinal  hypotension. Exaggerated BP might be due to a combination  of phenylephrine and glycopyrrolate as the latter also have  some intrinsic hypertensive properties. Conclusion Refractory hypertension as seen in our case has not been  reported after phenylephrine infusion. We suggest that  a high level of vigilance be maintained in monitoring the  patient when using such infusion and a further reduction  in prophylactic doses may be considered to prevent the  occurrence of hypertensive episodes ensuring maternal and  fetal safety.

Recurrent bilateral lung infiltrates in a patient with ulcerative colitis. Breathe 2022; 18: 220210 [DOI: 10.1183/20734735.0210-2022]. A 61 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease presented in the emergency department with a 10-day history of dyspnoea in mild physical activity. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (UC) 3 years ago, and 6 months earlier he started treatment with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (he had received two doses of infliximab, the first dose 2 months ago and the second dose 1 month ago) and mesalazine. 1 month after the last dose of anti-TNF-\u03b1 and 6 months after the initiation of therapy for UC he was hospitalised due to fever and severe respiratory failure (arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory oxygen fraction: 212) in the gastroenterology department. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed limited emphysema, bilateral ground-glass opacities and mosaic attenuation; thus, anti-TNF-\u03b1 induced interstitial pneumonia was suspected (figure 1a, b). Task 1 What would be the next step in the management of this patient? Choose as many as apply. a) Flexible bronchoscopy b) Initiate empiric treatment with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin or moxifloxacin) c) Discontinue anti-TNF-\u03b1 d) Initiate treatment with corticosteroids Go to Answers >> Due to the severe respiratory failure it was decided that the patient was not fit to undergo bronchoscopy. He was treated with moxifloxacin, systemic corticosteroids with gradual tapering over 2 months and anti-TNF-\u03b1 was discontinued. The patient\u2019s condition improved significantly and he continued receiving mesalazine. In the meantime, he underwent a follow-up chest CT with no ground-glass opacities (figure 2a, b), and he did not present with symptoms compatible with exacerbation of UC. 1 month after the gradual withdrawal of corticosteroids, the patient presented with shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation without symptoms from other systems. On examination, the patient was in mild distress, afebrile (temperature 36.6\u00b0C), tachypnoeic (respiratory rate 20 breaths per min), without tachycardia (heart rate 80 beats per min) and with a room air oxyhaemoglobin saturation of 86%. Physical examination revealed bilateral end-expiratory crackles and was otherwise normal. The leukocyte count was normal, while C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were mildly elevated at 22 mg\u00b7L\u22121 (upper normal limit 6 mg\u00b7L\u22121) and 41 mm\u00b7h\u22121, respectively. Arterial blood gases on room air revealed pH of 7.39, oxygen tension of 62.8 mmHg (8.37 kPa), carbon dioxide tension of 33.5 mmHg (4.46 kPa), bicarbonate of 21.4 mmol\u00b7L\u22121 and serum lactate of 1.40 mmol\u00b7L\u22121.

The clinical condition of the patient improved gradually, with a concomitant improvement of pulmonary functional tests (DLCO 67%, TLC 85% and FVC 3.42 L (82% pred)) (table 1) at 7 days after treatment initiation. He was discharged 1 week after hospitalisation and received oral methylprednisolone with gradual tapering over 3 months with no evidence of residual lung disease in the follow up CT (figure 4a, b). The patient was also reassessed after 6 months, remaining asymptomatic and without evidence of drug-induced pneumonitis relapse or pulmonary functional tests deterioration (table 1). After multidisciplinary discussion with the gastroenterology department, it was decided not to administer any treatment for UC, which was in full remission at present time. a) b) FIGURE 4 a, b) Follow-up chest computed tomography 3 months after the images shown in figure 3 (3 months after mesalazine discontinuation): complete resolution of bilateral ground-glass opacities, small centrilobular nodules and mosaic attenuation. https://doi.org/10.1183/20734735.0210-2022 4 BREATHE CASE REPORT | A. ASSIOURA ET AL. Discussion Bronchopulmonary disease is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of UC, the true prevalence of which is unknown. Interstitial pneumonia associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been described, the most common form being organising pneumonia. Patients may also present with diffuse parenchymal infiltrates induced by medication used for the management of UC (aminosalicylates, methotrexate, thiopurines, anti-TNF-\u03b1) or by opportunistic infections caused by these treatments [1]. In this specific case of a patient with UC presenting with acute respiratory failure, drug-induced pneumonitis was finally attributed to mesalazine treatment. Although mesalazine is usually well tolerated, associated toxicity has been rarely described with eosinophilic, cryptogenic organised or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia as the more typical patterns of respiratory involvement [2, 3]. The duration of treatment with mesalazine before the onset of symptoms varies between 1 month and several years (up to 8 years) [4, 5]. Likewise, anti-TNF-\u03b1 treatment is infrequently associated with drug-induced pneumonitis [6\u201310]. The onset of anti-TNF-\u03b1 induced lung injury can emerge between 2 and 6 months after the introduction of the drug, with rare cases occurring up to 44 months after the initial medicine administration [8, 11]. In this case, the relapse of the disease despite the discontinuation of anti-TNF-\u03b1 and receiving therapy with corticosteroids after the first manifestation of drug-induced pneumonitis 3 months ago, led to the investigation of alternative causes. Drug-induced pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, based on clinical suspicion, exposure to a pneumotoxic drug and exclusion of other causes of ILD [12]. In general, clinical, laboratory, radiological and histological features of drug-induced ILD (DI-ILD) are nonspecific and variable even with the same offending drug. The disease may have acute, subacute or chronic onset and the main symptom is worsening of dyspnoea. Patients with suspected DI-ILD should undergo bronchoscopy not only to rule out alternative diagnoses such as opportunistic infections, but also to help define histopathological features based on BAL findings. BAL of DI-ILD is usually a lymphocytic alveolitis with CD4/CD8 <1 ratio [13\u201315]. High-resolution CT findings are also nonspecific, but they can indicate the extent of the disease. Histological confirmation is not mandatory; however, it provides useful data that should be integrated with clinical and radiological findings to support the diagnosis of DI-ILD. In addition, morphological abnormalities of lung tissue, obtained usually by transbronchial biopsy, vary from acute/subacute interstitial pneumonia to established fibrosis and any histological pattern may be caused by a number of different drugs [16\u201318]. ILD in IBD reflects a spectrum of diseases, such as organising pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia (typically in smokers), eosinophilic pneumonia, and usual interstitial pneumonia [19, 20]. In this case ILD could not be attributed to UC as there were no manifestations of UC in other organs and more specifically the large intestine, and ground-glass opacities resolved, despite the discontinuation of the two UC-targeted therapies, anti-TNF-\u03b1 and mesalazine. Conclusion In all cases of ILD in patients with UC, drug-induced pulmonary disease should be excluded. Both anti-TNF-\u03b1 and mesalazine have been implicated in inducing ILD. In patients who receive both of these medicines and develop drug-induced pneumonitis, it is quite difficult to differentiate which one is the actual causing agent. In this case, the withdrawal of anti-TNF-\u03b1 after the first incident of drug-induced pneumonitis and the relapse 6 months after the initiation of therapy, while still receiving mesalazine, led to the discontinuation of mesalazine as the pneumonitis-provoking agent.

The most common primary malig- nancy in pleura is mesothelioma, while the metastatic pro- cess is the most recurrent secondary malignancy [1] . Both mesothelioma and metastatic process constitute the major proportion of malignancy cases in pleura, with the metastatic \u2729 Competing Interests: None. \u2217 Corresponding author.

Mesothelioma is a unique pleural malignancy related to chronic exposure to asbestos and carries an atrocious prog- nosis [4] . It is reported that the estimated annual incidence of mesothelioma is 10.000 across Western Europe, Scandi- navia, North America, Japan, and Australia. Among the said regions, every country reports various incidence rates, from 1.0/100.000 in the United States to 4.2/100.000 in the United Kingdom [ 1 ,5 ]. Radiology plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of pleural tu- mors. The chest X-ray is usually the first modality for patients with thoracic complaints [1] . In patients with malignancy sus- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2022.11.049 1930-0433/\u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of University of Washington.

Several findings suggested that extrapulmonary and pleural origin could be appreciated in chest X-rays, including incom- plete border signs and obtuse angle with the thoracic wall [2] . Pleural effusion is the most occurring secondary finding [4] and can be readily visible when a significant volume of fluid is present. Chest CT scan is a cross-sectional imaging modal- ity often used to visualize the lesion further and characterize its relationship with adjacent organs [1] . From a CT scan, radi- ological appearances of pleural diseases, such as focal or dif- fuse pleural thickening, pleural plaque, and calcification, can be better depicted. CT findings of particular importance in de- termining the pleural or extrapleural origin of the mass in- clude erosion of ribs and inward or outward displacement of extrapleural fat [6] . In some exceptional cases, imaging findings of the pleural tumor might be specific. However, in most other cases, the ap- pearance might not be as specific [6] . Moreover, many pleural conditions have overlapping radiological appearances, mak- ing diagnostic endeavors even more challenging. Here, in this report, we present a case of diffuse pleural metastasis from lung carcinoma mimicking mesothelioma. Case report A 61-year-old male presented in the outpatient clinic with chronic shortness of breath that had worsened in the past 2 weeks. The patient denied prolonged cough and nocturnal perspiration. He was a carpenter for over 30 years, quit 3 years ago, and he was a non-smoker with no history of cancer. Vi- tal signs were normal; nevertheless, the physical examination revealed apparent respiratory effort with lagging right chest movement. The complete blood test did not indicate a signif- icant abnormality. Initial chest X-ray ( Fig. 1 ) showed right pleural effusion with multiple heterogeneous opacities on the right lung. A small nodule was identified in the left paracardial with an evident hyperaeration on the left lung. Subsequent contrast-enhanced chest CT scan ( Fig. 2 ) demonstrated unilateral diffuse nodular pleural thickening in the right hemithorax involving fissures, parietal, visceral, me- diastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura, along with right pleural effusion, causing right compressive atelectasis. No discrete mass was visible in both lung fields, although left lung mul- tiple nodules were noted, and no evidence of chest wall in- volvement. No evidence of a distant metastatic process was observed from the bone survey and abdominal ultrasound. Pleural nod- ules (forceps biopsy, Fig. 3 ) biopsy and IHC test confirmed pul- monary adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 4 ) with wild-type EGFR muta- tion in COBAS EGFR test. The patient underwent four cycles of Pemetrexed-Cisplatin protocol according to the biopsy result. Post-treatment CT scan was planned to evaluate treatment results. However, due to elevated blood creatinine serum, only a non-contrast chest CT scan was performed, and this examination was able to note marked improvement of the pleural thickening ( Fig. 5 ). Fig. 1 \u2013 Pleural effusion, fissure thickening, and inhomogeneous opacities on the right lung were seen in the chest X-ray. A nodule was visible in the paracardial site on the left. Left lung hyperaeration was also evident. Discussion Our case report raises a challenging question on differen- tiating between primary pleural malignancy and metastatic process from a radiological standpoint. Our CT findings, with unilateral diffuse nodular pleural thickening, are highly sug- gestive of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is known as nodular thickening of the pleura that occur strictly unilateral but cir- cumferentially diffuse, involving fissures and diaphragmatic pleura, and may also affect the pericardium [ 4 ,7 ,8 ]. Mesothe- lioma also often causes volume loss in the affected lung, causing elevation of the diaphragm, narrowing of intercostal space, and mediastinal shift [ 4 ,7 ]. Nonetheless, mesothelioma rarely appears as a localized mass [7] . Although common in mesothelioma, pleural effusion is not a specific finding and may occur in other malignant pathologies, such as metastatic processes, and benign processes, such as heart failure [ 3 ,8 ]. In advanced disease, metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes and lung nodules may also present [7] . Histopathology examination in our case, however, has con- firmed the pathology to be adenocarcinoma originating from the lung. From our reference study, we found that adenocar- cinoma more often metastasizes to pleura than other types of histopathology, with the most common origins from the lung, breast, and ovarium [6] . Radiological findings of pleural metastasis include pleural effusion (most frequently from the breast), as well as focal or diffuse pleural thickening with in- volvement of parietal and visceral pleura. Lung fissures may also be affected [3] . Although diffuse pleural thickening may be found both in mesothelioma and metastatic process, Kim Fig. 2 \u2013 Axial (A) with coronal- (B) and sagittal-reformatted (C) contrast-enhanced chest CT showed diffuse irregular pleural thickening involving fissures, parietal, visceral, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura. Multiple nodules in the left lung were confirmed, with the largest dimension measuring approximately 1.9 cm (D). Fig. 3 Fig. 4 \u2013 Histopathology from biopsy (A) with 40 \u00d7 magnification showed tumor growth in a glandular pattern, which consists of the proliferation of anaplastic cells with round-oval, pleomorphic, and rough chromatin nuclei, consistent with adenocarcinoma. IHC smear (20 \u00d7 magnification) with Napshin-A positive within the tumor cell cytoplasm (B) and WT-1 negative in tumor cell nuclei (C), suggesting tumor origin from the lung. Fig.5 \u2013 Post-treatment unenhanced chest CT scan in axial (A) with coronal- (B) and sagittal-reformatted (C) plane show marked improvement in overall pleural and fissure thickening. Multiple right lung nodules can be well appreciated with the right lung fully expanded and without right pleural effusion. There is also a reduction in the greatest dimension of the left lung nodule (D), measured at approximately 1.1 cm (greater than 20% reduction). discovered that circumferential thickening, defined as contin- uous thickening involving greater than three-quarters of the pleura, is more related to mesothelioma [8] . Pleural metastasis may present as a sizeable solitary mass measuring up to 8-13 cm, as reported in several case reports [ 9 ,10 ]. Adenocarcinoma is a part of the major lung cancer group non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), constituting approxi- mately 40% of NSCLC [11] . NSCLC is the most common group of all lung malignancies, constituting 80%-87% of lung can- cer [ 12 ,13 ]. The other infrequent group, small cell lung can- cer, constitutes the rest and is associated with smoking and is more aggressive [13] . NSCLC may be situated either cen- trally or peripherally [13] , although one study reported that adenocarcinoma has a strong predilection in the peripheral site [12] . Radiological findings may vary from consolidation, ground-glass opacity, or a mix of both [13] . With the absence of discrete mass on visualized lungs, an- other minor possibility to consider is primary pleural adeno- carcinoma. However, in our literature study, we were unable to find any report of primary pleural adenocarcinoma. The clos- est condition that has been reported is primary pleural squa- mous cell carcinoma (SCC) [ 14 ,15 ], considering SCC belongs to NSCLC, the same group as adenocarcinoma in lung can- cer classification [12] . The reported radiological findings of pri- mary SCC in 2 case reports were single pleural nodule with no signs of invasion [14] , bilateral pleural effusion and irregular thickening with involvement of fissures and pericardium, as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy [15] . Other pleural eti- ologies considered rare from various literature include pleural lipoma, pleural splenosis, pleural pseudotumor, desmoplas- tic small round cell tumor, pleural involvement of Erdheim- Chester disease, diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis, syn- ovial sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, lymphoma, thymoma, and amyloidosis [ 1 \u20133 ,5 ,6 ]. Recently, there has been a development of targeted lung cancer therapy due to the discovery of EGFR mutation found in lung cancer. Nevertheless, in our case, the EGFR mutation status was confirmed to be wild-type. Many studies have been conducted to predict the EGFR mutation status of lung cancer based on imaging, stipulating that the EGFR mutation is asso- ciated with females and non-smokers. Radiological features associated with EGFR mutation are ground-glass attenuation of the tumor, the presence of air bronchogram, vascular con- vergence, spiculated margin, and pleural retraction [16] . On the other hand, wild-type EGFR tend to be linked to male and smoking [17] and is less likely to cause diffuse metastatic pro- cess [18] . To the best of our knowledge, the study related to EGFR mutation status and metastatic behavior of lung tumors is still relatively limited. EGFR mutation is more likely to cause diffuse \"miliary\" metastasis involving both lungs [19] , whereas EGFR wild-type is more likely to cause pleural metastasis [20] . However, further study is requisite to establish the ground of this concept. Conclusion Pleural mass remains a significant challenge for radiologists. A wide range of pathologies may arise in pleura, and their ra- diological appearance may overlap one another. A specialized multidisciplinary team is necessary to establish the diagnosis and plan the best course of action for patients\u2019 outcomes.

In this article we present a case of a patient with a first episode of severe depression with COVID-19-related psychotic features. A 59-year-old man with no history of mental disorders was admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit due to the symptoms of a severe depressive episode with psychotic features. Since March 2020, progressive deterioration of his mental health in the form of profound lowering of mood, anhedonia and lack of energy was observed. He was not infected nor exposed to infectious agents but presented delusions about being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and being a source of transmission to other people by using the toilet or going out. He suffered from Hashimoto disease and lymphoma diagnosed two months prior to the hospitalization with further diagnosis postponed due to the pandemic. He was administered venlafaxine 150 per day and mirtazapine 45 mg per day with addition of olanzapine up to 20 mg and risperidone up to 6 mg per day. No side effects were reported. The patient made a full recovery with the exception of slightly blunted ability to feel pleasure, minor problems with concentration and occasional pessimistic thoughts. The social distancing recommendations during the pandemic put a psychological strain related to alienation and negative emotions which in turn can favor development of depressive symptoms. Analysis of psychological mechanisms related to the pandemic and restrictions is significant for limiting the negative influence of global crisis on individual mental well-being. In this case the impact of global anxiety and its consequential integration into the developing psychopathological symptoms is especially interesting. The circumstances surrounding an episode of affective disorder may shape its course and thought content. Key words: delusions, SARS-CoV-2, depressive episode 946 Agnieszka Cyran et al. Introduction The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic had a major impact on both physical and mental health.. The pandemic has already reached almost 200 millions of laboratory- confirmed cases globally including up to 3 millions in Poland alone, and so far resulted in over 4 million deaths worldwide (data on 29th of July, 2021) [1]. However, its impact on mental health is further amplified by the presence of regional restrictions to limit further transmission of the virus. Although the neurotropism of SARSCoV- 2 has already been confirmed, the occurrence of psychopathological symptoms does not typically result from the infection [2]. The recent reports indicate that major psychological distress associated with the pandemic and social isolation recommendations can lead to relapse in patients with history of previous mental disorders [3\u20135]. Moreover, a multi-center study conducted in Denmark shows that manifestation of pandemic-related symptoms in patients attending local mental health centers correlates with current COVID-19 incidence and restrictions [6]. However, there is also some evidence of newly-developed mental disorders as a result of SARS-CoV-2 emergence and spread [4, 7, 8\u201313]. As it turns out, COVID-19 infection is not a crucial risk factor of exhibiting psychopathological symptoms. Stress related to the pandemic and restrictions resulting from it led to significant increase in morbidity, with anxiety symptoms detected in up to half of participants of studies conducted in various regions [14\u201321]. A meta-analysis comprised of 28 studies indicates occurrence of PTSD, anxiety and depressive symptoms in 26% of participants in various populations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [22]. In this article we present a case of a patient with a first episode of severe depression with COVID-19-related psychotic features despite that fact he was not diagnosed nor exposed to novel coronavirus whereas he was suffering from a lymphoma which diagnosis and treatment were postponed due to the pandemic. After the end of treatment, the patient consented to the publication of the case report Case presentation Medical history and mental state on admission A 59-year-old man was admitted to the Inpatient Psychiatric and Psychogeriatric Unit due to the severe depressive episode with psychotic features. He had no history of previous mental disorders. He is married to a wife with whom he has good relations and they have no children. He has higher economic education and has been working as an accountant for over 30 years. There was no history of alcohol or drug abuse. There are no mental disorders, drug or alcohol abuse nor suicidal death in his family. He has been treated for hypothyroidism in the course of Hashimoto disease. Several months before the manifestation of psychiatric symptoms he was diagnosed with non\u2013Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma localized in neck area. The patient was consulted hemaNovel psychopathological picture during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a first episode 947 tologically. Further diagnosis and treatment were postponed due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as his condition did not require an urgent intervention. At the initial phase of the pandemic he was working as usual but limited his contacts with others adhering to the general restrictions. None of his family members, friends or co-workers has been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and he was not quarantined. He did not exhibit any symptoms of an infectious disease. Progressive deterioration of his mental health was observed in March of 2020. He experienced sadness, lack of energy and interest, anhedonia. He reported insomnia in the form of shortened night sleep with early awakening, as well as lack of appetite and weight loss. Moreover, he was convinced that he could not cope with anything, he felt helpless and spent time idly. He also felt emotionally empty and believed his life had no value. With time he developed delusions of being severely ill and close to death. He became convinced that he was infected with SARS-CoV-2 and was spreading the virus to other people by using the toilet or going out. Additionally, he expected punishment and prison for being the source of the virus. Due to the severity of depressive symptoms clearly affecting the patient\u2019s daily functioning, including meeting basic life needs, in April 2020 he became unable to continue his professional work. Despite his lymphoma diagnosis, there were no somatic causes of his lack of energy, weight loss and malaise. His hematologist suggested a psychiatric consultation which resulted in the patient being referred to the psychiatric hospital. He had undergone a standard nasopharyngeal swab towards SARS-CoV-2 infection which came back negative. At admission the patient was sitting at the edge of the bed with his head down looking miserable and gloomy, making sporadic eye contact. His speech was quiet and slow. He was fully conscious, oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Verbal contact with him was formal but not fully substantive. He was in deeply depressed mood and his affect was restricted to the depressed range, periodically anxious. Psychomotor activity was decreased and apathy, anhedonia and emotional emptiness were observed. He had coherent line of thoughts, pessimistic thoughts and exhibited apparent delusions of guilt and punishment as well as delusions of reference. He did not demonstrate looseness of associations or hallucinations. Sleep and appetite were reduced. His insight and judgment were poor and superficial. He scored 49 points in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [23]. His physical examination and blood tests did not reveal any abnormalities. Thyroid hormones and TSH levels indicated euthyreosis (TSH 3.58 uIU/ml with a norm between 0.4\u20134; FT3 5.71 pmol/l with a norm between 2.76\u20136.45; and FT4 12.8 pmol/l with a norm between 11.4\u201322.5). Clinical management In the first days after admission high levels of psychotic anxiety were reported in the patient. He presented delusions of guilt and hypochondriac delusions, questioned 948 Agnieszka Cyran et al. the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 test. He declared that due to the non\u2013Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma diagnosis he only had one year of life left despite the contrary information provided by his hematologist. On occasions he also presented delusions of persecution \u2013 he believed that his hospital stay was a result of an anonymous denunciation made by a paramedic due to the epidemic hazard he had posed and that his food and liquids at the ward may be poisoned, so that he limited his food intake. Despite the fact he lacked energy and his psychomotor activity was decreased, his insomnia persisted. He was administrated venlafaxine 150 mg per day and mirtazapine 45 mg per day with addition of olanzapine up to 20 mg per day, which were gradually augmented with risperidone up to 6 mg per day due to ongoing presence of delusions. He tolerated the treatment very well. Additionally, he was administered 25 micrograms of thyroxine supplementation a day according to his previous treatment. As a result of the administered treatment, the patient gradually increased his activity, began to spend time with other patients, attended therapeutic classes and walks to the garden with a therapist. Moreover, a decreased focus on the pandemic or lymphoma\u2013related health issues was observed. After 5 weeks of the treatment, the patient presented significant improvements in his mental state allowing for discontinuation of olanzapine and reduction of risperidone down to 4 mg per day. No deterioration of his mental state was observed in response to the treatment modification. Psychological examination During the psychological examination performed on the 13th of July, the patient was auto and allo-oriented. Psychometric testing of cognitive functioning measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) [24, 25] showed a general absence of cognitive impairment (26/30 points). He correctly performed the tasks assessing the efficiency of eye-hand coordination, naming and abstract thinking. His efficiency in terms of the attention was within normal range and did not show any impairment of linguistic functions. However, long-term episodic memory deficits were observed at recall despite the overall score of cognitive functioning maintained within normal range. In the task assessing the ability to restore the memorized auditory material after the delay, the patient remembered one out of five previously learned words. Clinical evaluation and diagnostics conducted with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD) detected no diagnostic criteria of personality disorders [26]. After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient had a low or average severity of psychopathological symptoms measured with the SCL-90 Questionnaire (Table 1) [27, 28]. Novel psychopathological picture during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a first episode 949 Table 1. Results obtained on the SCL-90 questionnaire after treatment Symptoms Raw score (converted score) Interpretation Somatization 0 (0) low Obsessive-Compulsive 11 (1.1) average Interpersonal Sensitivity 10 (1.1) average Depression 11 (0.8) low Anxiety 5 (0.5) low Hostility 4 (0.7) average Phobic Anxiety 1 (0.1) low Paranoid Ideation 3 (0.5) low Psychoticism 8 (0.8) average MRI of the brain revealed single, minor ischemic lesions and ruled out metastases or malignant infiltrations, which could underlie a depressive disorder due to a general medical condition. Considering the whole clinical picture, the diagnosis of major depressive episode with psychotic symptoms was made. Due to the endogenous character of the disorder, the prognosis includes potential relapses and therefore, long-term treatment. The patient had reached a full recovery with the exception of slightly blunted ability to feel pleasure, minor problems with concentration and occasional pessimistic thoughts which at this point were associated with the diagnosis of lymphoma and anxiety regarding further somatic treatment. At his discharge the patient scored 3 points on the MADRS and was discharged with a recommendation to attend the outpatient psychiatric clinic for further treatment. At the first follow-up after 2 months since the discharge, the achieved recovery was stable, however, slight sedation and psychomotor retardation were observed. Further reduction of risperidone down to 2 mg per day and mirtazapine to 30 mg per day was ordered and led to improvement of patient\u2019s daily activity. The patient was able to go back to work and his usual activities such as biking or playing cards with his friends. After one year the patient confirmed that he still regularly takes his medication and visits a specialist at the outpatient clinic, which allows him to maintain his proper activity. During that time he did not develop any episodes of affective disorders. Patient perspective At the follow-up after 4 months, the patient was satisfied with complete reduction of his primary concerns. He did not report any symptoms of the disease nor side effects of the administered treatment. He regarded the disease as a reaction to excessive stress resulting from the onset of pandemic and did not consider prescribed drugs to 950 Agnieszka Cyran et al. be vital in his recovery. However, he could not explain why his symptoms did not reappear with the increase of COVID-19 incidence reported in the country. Despite that he decided to continue regular treatment and adhere to the recommendations. Additionally, he emphasized kind reception of his episode by his family and friends, which had concerned him at the time of the discharge. Discussion The foreseen rise of mental health problems related to the ongoing pandemic, lockdowns and quarantines has been confirmed by the recent literature. However, evidence indicates that sole fact of being quarantined does not significantly influence mental well-being compared to the consequences related to following restrictions on a daily basis [29]. The cases of relapses of psychosis or affective disorders resulting from rigorous restrictions and social isolation have been described [3\u20135]. It is assumed that people with previous history of mental disorders may be susceptible to worsening of their mental state due to the emergence of a novel virus and associated uncertainty and anxiety. This phenomenon is associated with the weakened action of defense mechanisms and more sensitive mental structure of this population. On the other hand, the major stressors are known to facilitate expression of mental disorders such as psychosis or affective diseases, however, this typically happens in early-life. Social distancing recommendations especially impact psychological burden associated with the feeling of alienation and negative emotions. These, in turn, in positive feedback loop with anxiety symptoms can favor development of PTSD or depressive symptoms [30]. Individual traits, such as social cognitive bias or low efficiency of emotional regulation lead to increased affective response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [31]. Loneliness poses another consequence of social distancing which significantly influences one\u2019s affective response [32]. Female sex, COVID-19 infection among family members, younger age, lower socioeconomic status, and previous history of physical diseases or mental disorders are listed as risk factors of decreased mental well-being in conditions of global pandemic [33\u201335]. Interestingly, none of those was present in the above-described case. The psychological traits observed in people susceptible to development of depressive or anxiety symptoms as a result of coronaphobia are high level of neuroticism, hypochondriasis and presence of reassurance\u2013seeking behaviors [36]. Interestingly, a protective influence of age above 60 against development of anxiety or depressive symptoms during the pandemic was reported, which can be associated with more effective emotional regulation and stress tolerance in older people [37]. This case presents a middle-aged man with no history of affective and anxiety disorders nor personality traits which can predispose to development of depressive symptoms. No risk factors other than physical diseases were observed. It suggests the necessity to be vigilant while dealing with psychopathological symptoms related to Novel psychopathological picture during the COVID-19 pandemic based on a first episode 951 coronaphobia. The potential pathophysiological influence of hypothyroidism resulting from Hashimoto disease needs to be taken into account. Patients with endocrinological disorders are undoubtedly at risk of depressive disorders, which can be associated with potential inflammatory pathology of depression. The presented patient had been successfully treated for hypothyroidism for over 10 years. In this case, a subconscious reactive factor such as serious hematological disease \u2013 a lymphoma which treatment had been postponed \u2013 may be of relevance. The pandemic and accompanying feeling of social endangerment acted as a trigger for development of severe depressive episode with psychotic features. The main message present both in society and media has been integrated as a part of the delusions, which primarily concerned current pandemic, and belief that the patient was a source of viral transmission. It has been described that the sociodemographic background and surrounding can greatly impact the content of delusions [5, 38]. There is apparent evidence of thought content alteration, with one instance of COVID-19-related delusions replacing prior symptoms, as a result of the pandemic [13]. Despite having no significant exposure or risk of contracting the virus disease, our patient developed a system of delusions related to this topic instead of his potentially more severe health problem, a newlydiagnosed lymphoma. This case illustrates development of a first depressive episode in conditions of relevant social stressor and furthermore, a response to combination pharmacological treatment. The preliminary findings suggest that novel cases of mental disorders developed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic tend to respond to the pharmacological intervention relatively quickly, while in this case a significant improvement was obtained during 5 weeks. Interestingly, the recovery correlated with the intensity of the pandemic news which our patient was exposed to before admission and at the ward. The term infodemic accurately describes both common and novel mental problems related to pandemic and puts special emphasis on potential management of such psychiatric consequences of pandemic by reducing the intensity or amount of exposure to the stressful stimuli [10]. Analysis of psychological mechanisms related to the pandemic and restrictions is significant for limiting the negative influence of global crisis on individual mental well-being [39\u201342]. On the other hand, a potential more direct causal influence of the virus on the occurrence of mental disorders is yet to be excluded [43]. Conclusions The middle-aged people are susceptible to the development of depressive disorders although this period of life is considered to be protective for development of pandemic\u2013related anxiety. Usually, it is possible to ascertain the significant personal events, although the connection between major life events and symptoms of psychiatric disorders is rarely direct. In this case, the impact of global anxiety related to SARS952 Agnieszka Cyran et al. CoV-2 pandemic and its consequential integration into the developing symptoms of affective disorder in the form of major psychotic depression is especially significant. The circumstances surrounding a developing episode of mental disorder may shape its course and thought content. Therefore, the mental health professionals should consider the potential overflow of negative information as a key factor in occurrence of psychopathological symptoms in susceptible individuals. Conscious media output and its influence on mental health need to be taken into account as a part of health policy during the global crisis.

This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Spain and concerns an adult male patient of unknown age, who experienced a non-serious adverse reaction of hypotension associated with telmisartan intolerance The proband, a 36 year-old male German patient presented in the author\u2019s outpatient clinic for renal evaluation in April 2016. He was the fourth child of unrelated and healthy parents. He was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy. The family history was negative for abortion and genetic abnormalities. He was diagnosed with arrhythmia at 21, and epididymal cysts at 27 years old in Germany. At that age, abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed bilateral, enlarged, cystic, and echogenic kidneys being diagnosed with Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Surgical intervention of bilateral inguinal hernias was undertaken in Germany. At this time, the patient was also receiving intermittent treatment with Ramipril (5 mg/daily), which was finally discontinued. His serum creatinine levels were 2 mg/dl with an eGFR of 44 mL/min/1.73 m2. His father was alive at 77 years old without a history of ADPKD or any other renal disease. His mother died at the age of 51 (unrelated to genetic known cardiac/renal disorder). His three brothers were asymptomatic based on medical history. There was no history of intracranial aneurysms, ADPKD, or other renal diseases in other family members. The first physical examination (in 2016, at 36 years old) established a well-developed male (weight, 85 kg; height, 196 cm; body mass index (BMI), 22.1 Kg/m2), presenting a decreased testicular volume. Blood pressure was 115/70 mmHg without any treatment. His serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dL and eGFR of 27 mL/min/1.73 m2. ECG showed a complete blockage of the right branch of the bundle of His, and abdominal MRI documented bilateral, enlarged, cystic kidneys. A TKV, 726 mL (right kidney 336 mL, left kidney 390 mL) and htTKV, 370 mL/m were measured by manual segmentation using MRI. The physician classified the patient into Mayo class 1B. However, the prediction of future eGFR based on Mayo imaging classification determined and estimated end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at 48 years old. No liver cysts were appreciated. The patient also had a saccular cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery measuring 11 \u00d7 5 mm, which the physician established by MRI angiography and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) angiography and arteriography. An intent of embolization resulted in failure, and he denied surgical intervention of the aneurysm. He was married but without offspring. Due to couple infertility, the patient also underwent urologic evaluation in the current Centre, which confirmed epididymal cysts and diagnosed azoospermia. Indeed, he had increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) (24.70 IU/L; normal range: 1.50\u20139.30 IU/L) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (60.12 IU/L; normal range: 1.40\u201318.10 IU/L) with normal prolactin (15.66 ng/mL; normal range: 2.10\u201317.70 ng/mL) and total testosterone (4.49 ng/mL; normal range: 1.65\u20137.53 ng/mL), but low free testosterone levels (12.30 pg/mL; normal range: 15.0\u201350.0 pg/mL). His triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin T4, thyroid stimulating (TSH) hormones, and vitamin-D (48 ng/mL; normal range: 30\u2013100 ng/mL) levels were normal, but parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (levels (169 pg/mL; normal range: 18.5\u201388.0 pg/mL) were increased. Bone mineral density examination also showed marked osteoporosis. A control CT cerebral angiography performed 18 months after the first observation (at 38 years old) revealed that the cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery had increased up to 11.9 \u00d7 5.3 mm. At 42 years old, his serum creatinine level was 5.4 mg/dL and eGFR was 12 mL/min/1.73 m2. Several intents of treatment with a low dose of Telmisartan (10 mg/daily) resulted in hypotension and were discontinued. Since genetic studies showed a likely pathogenic missense mutation in PKD1 in heterozygosis, the physician classified the patient as PROPKD 4 score (low risk of progression) and Mayo class 1B (low risk of progression). However, his TKV and htTKV values were significantly smaller than two of the current PKD1 cohorts used to monitor the current proband (PKD1 patients \u2264 40 years, and PKD1 with BMI < 25), but not smaller than PKD1 without hypertension. In fact, eGFR in the proband was significantly lower than the three PKD1 cohorts, according with his prediction of future eGFR (ESRD at 48 years, high risk of progression). Interestingly, the proband had no clinical features related to Gitelman syndrome (GS), at all. He showed that the serum magnesium (1.6\u20132.0 mg/dL) and potassium levels (3.9\u20134.7 mmol/L), and venous (pH 7.31\u20137.41) were within normal limits, although HCO3- levels in blood were inappropriately higher (24\u201331 mmol/L) for his grade of CRF. It was remarkable that during the follow-up course his blood pressure remained normal to low, despite the presence of severe Chronic renal failure (CRF), including ESRD; he also had an intolerance to telmisartan treatment. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenetic hereditary renal disease, promoting end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a consequence of an extra copy of the X chromosome in males. Main symptoms in KS include hypogonadism, tall stature, azoospermia, and a risk of cardiovascular diseases, among others. Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by SLC12A3 variants, and is associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, normal or low blood pressure, and salt loss. The three disorders have distinct and well-delineated clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings. The author here, reported a male patient with ADPKD who developed early chronic renal failure leading to ESRD, presenting with an intracranial aneurysm and infertility. NGS identified two de novo PKD1 variants, one known (likely pathogenic), and a previously unreported variant of uncertain significance, together with two SLC12A3 pathogenic variants. In addition, cytogenetic analysis showed a 47, XXY karyotype. The authors investigated the putative impact of this rare association by analyzing possible clinical, biochemical, and/or genetic interactions and by comparing the evolution of renal size and function in the proband with three age-matched ADPKD (by variants in PKD1) cohorts. The authors hypothesize that the coexistence of these three genetic disorders may act as modifiers with possible synergistic actions that could lead, in the patient, to a rapid ADPKD progression.

Abstract: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenetic hereditary renal disease, promoting end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a consequence of an extra copy of the X chromosome in males. Main symptoms in KS include hypogonadism, tall stature, azoospermia, and a risk of cardiovascular diseases, among others. Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by SLC12A3 variants, and is associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalciuria, normal or low blood pressure, and salt loss. The three disorders have distinct and well-delineated clinical, biochemical, and genetic findings. We here report a male patient with ADPKD who developed early chronic renal failure leading to ESRD, presenting with an intracranial aneurysm and infertility. NGS identified two de novo PKD1 variants, one known (likely pathogenic), and a previously unreported variant of uncertain significance, together with two SLC12A3 pathogenic variants. In addition, cytogenetic analysis showed a 47, XXY karyotype. We investigated the putative impact of this rare association by analyzing possible clinical, biochemical, and/or genetic interactions and by comparing the evolution of renal size and function in the proband with three age-matched ADPKD (by variants in PKD1) cohorts. We hypothesize that the coexistence of these three genetic disorders may act as modifiers with possible synergistic actions that could lead, in our patient, to a rapid ADPKD progression. Keywords: ADPKD; apoptosis; chronic kidney disease progression; fibrosis; Gitelman syndrome; intracranial aneurysm; Klinefelter syndrome 1. Introduction Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is mainly caused by mu\u0002tations in two main genes, PKD1 (OMIM#: 601313) and PKD2 (OMIM#: 173910) [1,2]. It is characterized by renal, progressive, age-related, fluid-filled cyst development, pro\u0002moting ESRD [3,4]. It is widely known that phenotype variability is highly associated with the mutated gene (PKD1 variants versus PKD2 variants), and the type of the variant (frameshift/nonsense versus non-truncating variants) [5]. However, the existence of sev\u0002eral modulator genes, and the existence of hypomorphic alleles may also largely affect the clinical features of ADPKD [5\u201312], including extra-renal clinical manifestations such as hepatic cysts, hernias, mitral valve prolapse, and intracranial aneurysms [3,4]. The renal Genes 2022, 13, 394. https://doi.org/10.3390/genes13030394 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/genes Genes 2022, 13, 394 2 of 14 disease progression of ADPKD involves not only cystogenesis, but also the activation of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways as a consequence of endothelial dysfunction [13,14]. Indeed, ADPKD, as a single gene disorder, is associated with numerous signaling cascades and reactions involved in cellular polarity, proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis [13\u201315]. Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is the most common genetic cause of infertility, and is the most variable aneuploidy (0.15% of the general population), showing high phenotypic variability and comorbidities. It is one of the common sex chromosome disorders in men. Inter\u0002estingly, approximately 64% of these cases were undiagnosed throughout life [16,17]. A non-disjunction of paired X-chromosomes during the first or second meiotic division [17] may contribute to its origin, and is equally due to a paternal/maternal meiotic missegrega\u0002tion event. KS clinical manifestations were associated with increased risk for mitral valve prolapse, pulmonary embolism, aortic valvular disease, autoimmune diseases, the rupture of the berry aneurysms, lower-extremity varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis, venous stasis ulcers, type II diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome [18\u201321], extra-gonadal germ cell tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [22], a 20-fold-higher risk of developing breast cancer, and osteoporosis. KS patients also have hypogonadism, which may increase the risk of atherogenesis [18]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the KS phenotype have not been clearly understood yet, although both genetic and epigenetic effects, due to the supernumerary X-chromosome, seem to contribute to this pathological pattern [23\u201326]. Gitelman syndrome (GS, OMIM #263800) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the SLC12A3 gene which encodes the thiazide-sensitive Na+/Cl\u2212 cotransporter. GS is clinically characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypereninemia, and hyperaldosteronism with normal or low blood pressure and salt loss [27]. Most of patients with GS present during childhood or early adulthood, however, it has high clinical variability, and some patients may not have GS features [27\u201331]. We here report a patient with ADPKD and coexisting masked KS and GS, based on genetic studies and clinical features. Although the three disorders may have different genetic, biochemical, and clinical findings, it is possible that the overlapping findings have influenced each other. We investi\u0002gated the possibility that this fact may be a consequence of putative genetic interactions and/or additive or synergistic effects through the different signaling pathways. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Follow-Up Study We compared the clinical evolution of ADPKD in the proband with our three control PKD1 defined cohorts by kidney magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [32] and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) studies. To this end, total kidney volume (TKV), height adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV), and eGFR were determined. The eGFR was de\u0002termined by the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation using the serum creatinine and the serum cystatin C values calculated using the formula: eGFRCysC = 77.24 \u00d7 (Cys\u22121.2623). Mayo clinic imaging classification and the prediction of future eGFR based on the classification were determined in the proband [33]. 2.2. Genetics Analysis 2.2.1. ADPKD by MLPA Analysis ADPKD gross deletion analysis was made by means of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using the SALSA MLPA KIT P351/P352 for PKD1/PKD2 (MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Data analysis was done with Coffalyser v6 MLPA Analysis Software (MRC-Holland). 2.2.2. Massive Parallel Sequencing Analysis Massive parallel sequencing analysis was performed with a custom-targeted next\u0002generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel (Nefroseq v1.2) designed for the study of the full spectrum of genetic nephropathies (which includes 380 genes related to kidney dis- Genes 2022, 13, 394 3 of 14 eases) [34]. The sequence was captured using SeqCap EZ technology (Roche Nimblegen. Madison, WI, USA) and subsequently ran on a Hiseq4000 (Illumina. San Diego, CA, USA). Bioinformatics analysis was performed in-house by using publicly available software tools (trimmomatic-0.32; Bowtie2 v2.1.0; Picard-tools v1.27; Samtools v0.1.19-44428cd; Bedtools v2.26.0; Genome Analysis TK v3.3-0 y SnpE 4.1l; ClinVar date 20140703 dbscSNV1.1 db\u0002NSFP version 3.0 dbSNP v138), and simultaneously with variant Caller V2.1 tool (Illumina). In silico pathogenicity prediction was analyzed using Alamut 2.7 (interactive Biosoftware, Rouen, France) and others such as SIFT Ensembl 66; Polyphen-2 v2.2.2; Mutation Assessor, release 2; FATHMM, v2.3; Gerp2; PhyloP; CADD, v1.3. Population frequencies of the de\u0002tected variants were assessed using the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; Exac r0.3) data; 1000 genome project; Spanish Exon Variant Project; NHLBI exome sequencing project: ESP6500_EA_AF). After the filtering of the relevant variants, validation of the candidate variants in the patient and parents was carried out through traditional Sanger Sequencing (see below). In parallel to the analysis process, exhaustive quality control of the sequenced samples was performed according to a custom pipeline (a suite of QC scripts that facilitate data quality assessment), available upon request. Classification and interpretation of the variants were made according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. 2.2.3. Sanger Sequencing PKD1 mutation screening for coding sequences and intron/exon boundaries for exons 27 and 29 were confirmed by Long Range-PCR and direct sequencing. SLC12A3 mutation screening for coding sequences and intron/exon boundaries for exons 16 and 25 was performed by PCR and direct sequencing. PCR conditions and primers (designed with the help of Primer3 plus v04.0 Software) are available upon request. PCR products were sequenced using BrightDye Terminator cycle kit (Nimagen, Nijmegen, The Netherland) and run on an ABI3730XL Sequencer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.2.4. Azoospermia Studies Our pipeline routine for azoospermia studies includes microdeletions of the Y-chromosome, karyotyping, and cystic fibrosis analysis. The Y-chromosome microdeletions analysis was performed by standard fragment analysis, by multiplex PCR of STS markers and direct sequencing (primers are available upon request). The molecular diagnosis of Y-chromosome microdeletions was performed following the recommendations of the EAA/EMQN best practice guidelines [35]. Briefly, two multiplex PCR were carried out in each patient. Multiplex A contained primers for SRY and ZFX/ZFY genes and for AZF a, b, and c regions (sY86, sY127, and sY254, respectively). A second multiplex PCR was performed to reinforce diagnostic accuracy. This multiplex contained a second set of primers for AZF a, b, and c regions (sY84, sY134, and sY255, respectively), in addition to primers for SRY and ZFX/ZFY genes. In parallel to the patient\u2019s DNA sample, a DNA sample from a normal male with normal spermatogenesis and a female were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. A water sample was also run as a control for reagent contamination. Cystic fibrosis screening was made by a commercial kit of CFTR analysis (Devyser; HQ, H\u00e4gersten, Sweden). Cytogenetic analyses were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes by GTG\u0002banded metaphases at a resolution of about 550 bands according to standard laboratory protocol using Chromosome Kit P (Euroclone, Siziano PV, Italy). Normally, 20 metaphases were counted. 3. Results 3.1. Case Presentation The proband, a 36 year-old male German patient presented in our outpatient clinic for renal evaluation in April 2016.

The patient also had a saccular cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery measur- Genes 2022, 13, 394 5 of 14 ing 11 \u00d7 5 mm, that we established by MRI angiography and confirmed by computed tomography (CT) angiography and arteriography (Figure 1C). An intent of embolization resulted in failure, and he denied surgical intervention of the aneurysm. He was mar\u0002ried but without offspring. Due to couple infertility, the patient also underwent urologic evaluation in our Centre, which confirmed epididymal cysts and diagnosed azoospermia. Indeed, he had increased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) (24.70 IU/L; normal range: 1.50\u20139.30 IU/L) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (60.12 IU/L; normal range: 1.40\u201318.10 IU/L) with normal prolactin (15.66 ng/mL; normal range: 2.10\u201317.70 ng/mL) and total testosterone (4.49 ng/mL; normal range: 1.65\u20137.53 ng/mL), but low free testos\u0002terone levels (12.30 pg/mL; normal range: 15.0\u201350.0 pg/mL). His triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxin T4, and thyroid stimulating (TSH) hormones, and vitamin-D (48 ng/mL; normal range: 30\u2013100 ng/mL) levels were normal, but parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (levels (169 pg/mL; normal range: 18.5\u201388.0 pg/mL) were increased. Bone mineral density examination also showed marked osteoporosis. A control CT cerebral angiography per\u0002formed 18 months after the first observation (at 38 years old) revealed that the cerebral aneurysm of the left anterior communicating artery had increased up to 11.9 \u00d7 5.3 mm. At 42 years old, his serum creatinine level was 5.4 mg/dL and eGFR was 12 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 1). Several intents of treatment with a low dose of Telmisartan (10 mg/daily) resulted in hypotension and were discontinued. Table 1. Evolution of electrolytes and renal function on the proband.

Follow-Up Study Since genetic studies showed a likely pathogenic missense mutation in PKD1 in het\u0002erozygosis, we classified the patient as PROPKD 4 score (low risk of progression) [36] and Mayo class 1B (low risk of progression). However, his TKV and htTKV values were significantly smaller than two of our PKD1 cohorts used to monitor our proband (PKD1 patients \u2264 40 years, and PKD1 with BMI < 25), but not smaller than PKD1 without hy\u0002pertension (Table 2). In fact, eGFR in the proband was significantly lower than the three PKD1 cohorts, according with his prediction of future eGFR (ESRD at 48 years, high risk of progression). Moreover, Table 1 shows that the patient experimented a rapid progression from CRF to ESRD in only four years. Interestingly, the proband had no clinical features related to GS, at all. He showed that the serum magnesium (1.6\u20132.0 mg/dL) and potassium levels (3.9\u20134.7 mmol/L), and venous (pH 7.31\u20137.41) were within normal limits, although HCO3- levels in blood were inappropriately higher (24\u201331 mmol/L) for his grade of CRF (Table 1). It is remarkable that during the follow-up course his blood pressure remained normal to low, despite the presence of severe CRF, including ESRD; he also had an intolerance to telmisartan treatment.

Fertility Studies Cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood showed a 47, XY,+X karyotype (Figure 1D). Y-chromosome microdeletion analysis and variant analysis of the CFTR gene were negative. 3.3.2. NGS Studies NGS studies detected a previously described missense variant in PKD1; NM_001009944.3:c.9499A>T(p.Ile3167Phe) (Figure 1E, left) in heterozygosis at exon 27. This variant was reported in different ethnicities [12,37\u201339], including European Non\u0002Finnish (although in the latter ones, with a population frequency under the threshold established for nonpathogenic variants; source, Varsome). It was previously classified as a variant of uncertain significance VUS (http://pkdb.mayo.edu/ (accessed on 14 December 2021); ADPKD mutation database), and as a disease (Uniprot), which re\u0002flect conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (ClinVar), as well as VUS (LOVD), VUS (HGMD), and, following ACMG/AMP 2 criteria [40], it is likely pathogenic (LP) (PM1, PP2, PP3, PP4, PP5, BS2). In addition, we detected a second PKD1 missense variant NM_001009944.3:c.9756G>C(p.Glu3252Asp) (Figure 1E, right) in heterozygosis at exon 29, that was not previously reported in known databases (Mayo, Uniprot, ClinVar, LOVD, ALAMUT), nor in gnomAD research projects. It was classified using ACM/AMP 2 criteria as VUS (PM2, PP2, PP3). Both variants were validated by Sanger sequencing in the proband. In addition, NGS analysis also established two SLC12A3 variants, NM_000339.3:c.1928C>T (p.Pro643Leu) (Figure 1F, left) in exon 16 and NM_000339.3:c.2891G>A(p.Arg964Gln) (Figure 1F, right) in exon 25, associated with GS. Both SNVs were previously described in clinical databases (p.Pro643Leu: ClinVar; conflicting interpretation of pathogenicity; LOVD, LP; Uniprot, disease; Varsome, LP/pathogenic (P) and p.Arg964Gln: ClinVar; LP/P; LOVD, P; Varsome, LP, P) and classified under ACMG/AMP 2 criteria as LP and P, respectively. Both variants were also confirmed by Sanger sequencing only in the proband (no other members of the family were available at this time). Thus, we cannot establish familial segregation for those and previous variants. No other pathogenic variants were found in other ADPKD-associated genes (PKDH1, GANAB, ACE, etc,) or related to cyst progression. The analysis of CNV by means of MLPA for PKD1, and PKD2, and the rest of the panel (using the algorithm Lacon v1.2 tool; INGEMM) was negative. Genetic findings are shown in Table 3.

Discussion 4.1. ADPKD In ADPKD, the uncontrolled growth of renal cysts increases renal volume and the destruction of the parenchyma progressively, resulting in renal failure in most patients [41]. In addition, endothelial dysfunction which occurs very early in the course of the disease appears to be involved in increased oxidative stress and inflammation [42,43]. Then, the progression of ADPKD is highly variable, in part because of the gene affected [1\u20137], as well as the presence of other variants modifying its effect. In fact, how environmental factors and/or modifier genes/variants may modulate ADPKD, involving a rapid progression of the disease [6\u20138,13,44,45], is still unknown. Indeed, the presence of additional gene variants may promote cystogenesis and/or fibrosis, and potentiate the advancement toward ESRD [4\u20138,14]. At this point, there is some evidence of how synergistic effects between PKD1 and PKD2 loci may accelerate the progression to ESRD approximately 20 years earlier than patients with only PKD1 sequence variants [6,7]. Cyst growth in ADPKD is associated with increases in epithelial cell proliferation, dedifferentiation, and fluid secretion. Then, the enlargement of cysts affects surround\u0002ing nephrons interrupts kidney function significantly [36,41,44]. Indeed, cyst pressure induces renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) activation and kidney hypoxia. At the late stage of ADPKD, cyst formation is always accompanied by extracellular matrix deposition and fibrosis formation [14,15,41], which reduces renal function and eventu\u0002ally leads to progression to ESRD [14,41]. In addition, oxidative stress/reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ADPKD has also been considered a new player and/or early predictor for such disease progression [46,47], either directly, starting endothelial dysfunction and generating arterial atherosclerosis, or weakening of the arterial medial layer leading to arterial aneurysms [48]. Therefore, ADPKD can also be related to extra-renal manifestations, such as symptomatic extra-renal cysts, hypertension, and subarachnoid hemorrhage from intracranial aneurysms [49,50]. Interestingly, we classified our proband as low risk of progression (Mayo class 1B and PROPKD 4 score), however, the eGFR predicted established the development of ESRD at 48 years (rapid progression). In fact, his real situation of ESRD had been achieved at age of 40 (eGFR 16 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) or 42 years (eGFR 12 mL/min/1.73 m2 ). Furthermore, his eGFR was significantly lower than expected when it was compared with three differ\u0002ent age-matched ADPKD cohorts, one with similar htTKV (Table 2). Thus, we suggest the predominant expression of renal tubulointerstitial inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and/or vascular disease over cyst growth in this patient. It may explain the discordance observed between different markers of risk of ADPKD progression and between htTKV and eGFR evolution. Genes 2022, 13, 394 8 of 14 4.2. Klinefelter Syndrome The presence of more than one X-chromosome in men characterized KS, which is the most common genetic cause of human male infertility. KS is related to high comorbidity with a lower life expectancy. It is thought that overexpression of some genes on the extra X-chromosome may be the cause. However, what genes and how they interact remain unclear [51\u201354]. We know that KS individuals may have an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [18], an aspect that could affect the severity of the extra-renal complications in our patient. Due to the Lyonization phenomenon, in KS individuals only one of the X-chromosomes in the somatic cells is fully active, although around 15% of the genes on the inactive X-chromosome continue to be expressed, albeit at a lower level. Thus, recent works, focused on identifying those gene clusters that escape from X-inactivation in KS patients, have revealed altered functionality in KS by several protein complexes grouped by clusters [53]. Among those clusters, one of the most significant comorbidity clusters includes PKD1 [53]. In addition, KS can lead to structural alterations in tissues [16] in different ways, including heart diseases, insulin resistance [18], thrombotic events, or subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial saccular aneurysm rupture [20,21,55]. These facts could affect the process of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [24]. The association of KS with other disorders is expected due to the relatively high frequency of this entity [56]. 4.3. Hypergonadotropic Hypogonadism Male ADPKD patients may present with several reproductive system abnormalities and infertility [57\u201359]. Patients with KS usually show gonadal dysfunction with increased FSH and LH levels. Similar hormonal dysfunction was often found in male patients with CRF of any etiology [60]. So, CRF is associated with an increase in the FSH and the LH levels due to the impairment of the renal function in catabolizing these hormones, with normalization after renal transplantation [60]. Consequently, if a patient has these two conditions (KS and CRF from ADPKD) at the same time, the presence of an increase in the FSH and the LH levels, which are seen in CRF, can overlap with the KS manifestations masking and leaving the KS undiagnosed. This case illustrates an under-recognized lag in the diagnosis of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, since the superposition of the two events is rare (decrease in free testosterone and increase in FSH and LH levels), indicating that in addition to KS, this effect may be caused by coexisting CRF. 4.4. Gitelman Syndrome GS caused by SLC12A3 sequence variations is characterized by hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, RAAS activation with normal or low blood pressure, salt loss, and hypokalemia [27]. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC12A3 is necessary for establishing the diagnosis of GS. NGS showed two previously reported heterozygous mis\u0002sense variants in the SLC12A3 gene: c.1928C>T(p.Pro643Leu) and c.2891G>A(p.Arg964Gln). However, we have not found electrolyte alterations characteristic of GS in our proband. Thus, the phenotypic effect of such missense variants is difficult to evaluate, and some pathogenic variants may not be sufficient to cause phenotypic changes related to GS [27\u201331], although, we cannot rule out that modifier genes are involved in the onset of GS or that phenotypic changes caused by this compound heterozygous would be apparent later in life. Indeed, our proband had a reduced eGFR at the time of the first evaluation, and this fact could in part mask the electrolyte alterations of GS (Table 1). 4.5. Co-Occurrence of ADPKD, KS, and GS We describe the first report of ADPKD combined with KS and GS, which initially were unnoticed, indicating the need to consider the concurrent existence of additional disorders in cases of atypical ADPKD manifestations. This patient carries clinically significant vari\u0002ants in two different genes and a huge genomic rearrangement (one extra X-chromosome) responsible for additional pathology. Therefore, all these entities in one individual are not Genes 2022, 13, 394 9 of 14 common, but it depends on the prevalence of each disease. Taking into account that their prevalences are around one in 500\u20131000 (ADPKD) [3,4] and one in 500\u20131000 (KS) male births [16,17], respectively, the probability for the simultaneous occurrence of these two disorders is approximately 1/250,000\u20131,000,000 births. Therefore, the occurrence of both ADPKD and KS in a single individual is in fact, theoretically, very rare. The prevalence of GS is estimated at approximately 1:40,000 [27]. Then, the occurrence of ADPKD, KS, and GS is even a rarer event. The effects of two or more genetic disorders in the same patient are unknown, and they can be additives, protectives, or neutrals [61], and may be influenced by the extent to which the clinical features with each individual disease overlaps with the other. Thus, the diseases can be distinct or overlapping. Distinct effects may affect different organ systems, whereas overlapping clinical effects are more likely to be caused by two genes encoding for proteins that normally interact within the same signaling pathway. Since ADPKD in association with KS and GS has never been reported in the literature, the possible effect of each other is currently unknown. Therefore, at this point, it is not clear if KS and GS will affect the cyst progression of ADPKD or vice versa. Indeed, the severe ADPKD phenotype denoted in our patient can be a consequence of two, not so strong variants in PKD1 gene associated with other genetic variants (two SLC12A3 variants and an extra X-chromosome). In addition, we cannot rule out that the PKD1 variant c.9756G>C may have a role as a hypomorphic allele [11,12], or may occur from a putative alteration of topological chromatin organization (TAD; topologically associating domains). We now know that enhancers regulate the expression of distal target genes via long-range regulatory chromatin loops within the genomic context of TADs [62]. The later hypothesis needs to be also explored. The clinical progression to ESRD and disease prognosis in this patient with ADPKD, KS, and GS (isolated KS or GS not producing CRF) could be potentially synergistic and comparable to individuals with variants in both PKD1 and PKD2 [6,7], hypomorphic PKD1 variants and likely biallelic disease [12], the contiguous gene syndrome TSC2-PKD1 [8], co-occurrence of ADPKD and hereditary renal hypouricemia [45], or dual sequence variants in PKD2 and COL4A1 [63]. In fact, our patient with an LP variant in PKD1, KS, and a compound heterozygous GS-associated variant showed a severe phenotype of ADPKD, characterized by the development of early CRF (at 27 years old) and rapid evolution to ESRD (at 40 years old) (Table 1), associated with an intracranial aneurysm (Figure 1C). He developed ESRD 15\u201320 years earlier than patients with a P/LP variant in PKD1 (average age of 58 years) [4,24,37,38]. Indeed, our patient also carries features that are atypical for ADPKD, such as the development of early CRF without severe hypertension and quick evolution to ESRD, typically associated with significant cyst burden. However, he only manifested moderate ADPKD by kidney length. This fact suggests a putative effect of modifier genes with a predominant development of fibrosis over cyst growth, as has been demonstrated in a TGF-\u03b21-induced fibrosis murine model [64,65]. Therefore, discordance between cyst burden and renal function decline trajectories that could be explained by lower cyst growth and remarkably slowed kidney enlargement in this ADPKD patient. In the present study, it was hypothesized that coexisting ADPKD with masked KS and GS may have a synergistic effect on the stimulation of rapid evolution to ESRD, and their synergistic effect may be the result of regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including vascular disease [66\u201373] (see Figure 2). On the other hand, in both ADPKD and KS there is an elevated frequency of intracra\u0002nial aneurysms and, in the case of associated variants in PKD1 protein and KS, it is expected to have at least additive intracranial aneurysms in disease presentation [21,49,50,55]. Thus, inferred by our data, he appears to be more severely affected than is typically reported with either condition alone. In fact, we detected an intracranial aneurysm with increased growth in a short period of time. Thus, the presence of an additive/synergistic effect may be explained by the underlying molecular function of the polycystin-1 protein and KS. Indeed, it has been previously established that loss of polycystin-1 function reduces control of Ras and aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. Moreover, activation of the Genes 2022, 13, 394 10 of 14 mTOR pathway and increased vascular endothelial apoptosis in KS [66] and ADPKD could affect the intracranial aneurysm growth in our patient [23,24,67]. Finally, other possible factors that could affect ADPKD progression and the growth of the intracranial aneurysm in this patient include also an increased RAAS stimulation, apoptosis, fibrosis, and vascular disease [26,27,68].

On the other hand, in both ADPKD and KS there is an elevated frequency of intra\u0002cranial aneurysms and, in the case of associated variants in PKD1 protein and KS, it is  expected to have at least additive intracranial aneurysms in disease presentation  [21,49,50,55].

Thus, the presence of an addi\u0002tive/synergistic effect may be explained by the underlying molecular function of the pol\u0002ycystin-1 protein and KS. Indeed, it has been previously established that loss of polycys\u0002tin-1 function reduces control of Ras and aberrant activation of the mTOR pathway. More\u0002over, activation of the mTOR pathway and increased vascular endothelial apoptosis in KS  [66] and ADPKD could affect the intracranial aneurysm growth in our patient [23,24,67]. Finally, other possible factors that could affect ADPKD progression and the growth of the  intracranial aneurysm in this patient include also an increased RAAS stimulation, apop\u0002tosis, fibrosis, and vascular disease [26,27,68]. 5. Conclusions  We present, for the first time a young ADPKD patient with an early, fast progression  to ESRD, as well as growth of an intracranial aneurysm, accompanied with masqueraded  KS and GS. We think that the presence of a 47, XXY karyotype and compound heterozy\u0002gous variants in SLC12A3 may increase the pathogenic action of PKD1 variants. This is  done, we presume, by increasing apoptosis, fibrosis, and producing predominant tubule\u2013 interstitial and vascular renal injury, instead of cystic growth, as it has been suggested in  murine models. The use of NGS in the genetic diagnosis of different diseases is currently  demonstrating the coexistence of several genetic variants in the same patient, which may  contribute to the high variability and heterogeneity observed in numerous individuals.  This case illustrates the importance of performing genetic testing to establish a complete  diagnosis in ADPKD patients with atypical presentations and/or with fertility abnormal\u0002ities.
