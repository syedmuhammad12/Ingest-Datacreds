NUP214::ABL1 fusion is detected in 6% of\r\nT-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and is very rare in B-ALL. We present a case\r\nof adolescent with B-ALL and a cryptic NUP214::ABL1 fusion which was initially missed\r\nduring diagnostic screening and was detected by additional RNA sequencing. Treatment\r\nwith specific ABL-inhibitor Imatinib was added later in therapy with a good effect. Initial\r\ntreatment according to conventional chemotherapy was complicated by severe side\r\neffects. At the end of Consolidation, the patient was stratified to a high risk group with\r\nallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation because of insufficient response to\r\ntherapy. At that time, targeted RNA sequencing detected NUP214::ABL1 gene fusion\r\nwhich was previously missed due to a small microduplication in the 9q34 chromosome\r\nregion. Gene variant analysis revealed no TKI-resistant ABL1 mutations; therefore,\r\ntreatment with Imatinib was added to target the NUP214::ABL1 fusion protein. A\r\nnegative minimal residual disease was achieved, and treatment was downgraded to\r\nintermediate risk protocol.

A new BCR-ABL-like\r\nsubgroup of tyrosine-kinase driven ALL has been associated\r\nwith a poor response to chemotherapy, a high relapse risk,\r\nand unfavorable long-term outcomes (1). In the 2016 updated\r\nWorld Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms\r\nand acute leukemia, BCR-ABL1-like B-ALL was added as a new\r\nprovisional entity (2). Its gene expression profile is similar to\r\nBCR::ABL1, however, is lacking BCR::ABL1 fusion (3). The\r\npresence of Nucleoporin 214-ABL Proto-Oncogene 1\r\n(NUP214::ABL1) gene fusion is detected in 6% of T-ALL,\r\nwhereas it is rare in B-ALL (4). A series of genes that activate\r\ntyrosine kinase and cytokine receptor signaling are affected in\r\nBCR-ABL1-like ALL, suggesting the potential interest of targeted\r\ntreatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (5). However, the\r\ntherapeutic effect of TKI for the NUP214::ABL1-positive patients\r\nis disputable as clinical experience is limited (6–11). Standard\r\nworldwide screening methods for known ABL1 gene fusions\r\ninclude fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and\r\nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (12).\r\nNevertheless, these screening techniques detect a limited number\r\nof alterations as BCR-ABL1-like ALL is known for its highly\r\nheterogeneous background (13).\r\nWe present a case of pediatric B-ALL with a cryptic NUP214::\r\nABL1 gene fusion which was initially missed during diagnostic\r\nscreening due to unusual genetic alteration and was identified by\r\nthe targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) only. Treatment\r\nwith a first-generation TKI (imatinib) was added to the\r\nchemotherapy with a good effect.\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION\r\nA 15 year-old boy with no previous significant medical history\r\nwas admitted to our pediatric department in July 2020 for high\r\nfever, petechial and hemorrhagic rash, and vomiting. The blood\r\ncount showed hemoglobin 51 g/L, platelet count 34 × 109/L, and\r\nhyperleukocytosis 464.5 109/L. Immunophenotyping confirmed\r\nthe expression of B-lymphoid markers CD45, CD19, CD10,\r\nCD20, CD81, CD22, cCD22, CD24, and cCD79a. Routine\r\ngenomic screening by a single nucleotide polymorphism array\r\n(SNP-A) detected normal male karyotype 46,XY without larger\r\naberrations in size ≥5 Mb. FISH and RT-PCR did not detect any\r\nof the following recurrent rearrangements: BCR::ABL1, KMT2A,\r\nEPOR, ABL1, ABL2, RUNX1 (CSF1R), PDGFRB, E2A (TCF3),\r\nJAK2, ETV6::RUNX1, or CRLF2. Cerebrospinal fluid showed\r\nthree WBC/μl and ~5.8% of aberrant phenotype B-lymphoid\r\ncells, with no leukemic blasts in cytospin. B-ALL, CNS1 was\r\ndiagnosed.\r\nTreatment was conducted according to ALLTogether protocol\r\nInduction B with dexamethasone, vincristine, daunorubicin,\r\npegylated-asparaginase (PEG-Asp), and intrathecal\r\nmethotrexate. At the end of induction, at time point 1 (TP1),\r\nminimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow showed residual\r\ncells of 0.79% by flow cytometry (FC) and 0.03% by IG/TCR\r\nFIGURE 1 | Treatment flowchart and timeline of symptoms.

Imatinib Effective in BCR-ABL1-like ALL\r\nquantitative PCR, respectively. Discrepancy in the lab results was\r\ninterpreted as a subclone of leukemic cells that was not captured\r\nby PCR, and the patient was stratified to intermediate-high risk\r\n(IR-H) due to a slow response to the therapy as per protocol\r\n(Figure 1). Consolidation with dexamethasone, vincristine, 6-\r\nmercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, PEG-Asp, and\r\nintrathecal methotrexate was given according to IR-H protocol.\r\nBone marrow evaluation on day 71, time point 2 (TP2) still\r\nshowed positive MRD: ~0.18% and 0.07% by FC and IG/TCR\r\nquantitative PCR respectively. The patient was stratified into\r\nHigh-Risk (HR) group with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell\r\ntransplantation (allo-HSCT) (Figure 1).\r\nChemotherapy was complicated by multiple side effects. The\r\npatient was treated at the intensive care unit twice because of\r\nrepeated tonic-clonic seizures caused by venous sinus thrombosis\r\nin Induction phase and because of severe acute pancreatitis in\r\nConsolidation 1. Acute pancreatitis was complicated by multiple\r\norgan dysfunction including renal function impairment and toxic\r\nmyocarditis. Furthermore, the patient suffered from\r\nmalnutrition, liver toxicity and mixed anxiety-depressive\r\ndisorder. On day 71 (TP2), targeted RNA sequencing was\r\nperformed on patient’s RNA sample using TruSight Pan-\r\nCancer sequencing kit as described earlier (14). Sequencing\r\ndata analysis revealed t(9;9)(q34;q34)/NUP214::ABL1 gene\r\nfusion. Exon 33 of the NUP214 gene and exon 3 of the ABL1\r\ngene were fused. RT-PCR method was used to confirm NUP214::\r\nABL1 fusion transcript. Gene variant analysis showed no TKIresistant\r\nABL1 mutations; therefore, treatment with a firstgeneration\r\nTKI imatinib mesylate was added to the\r\nconventional chemotherapy. Complete remission (CR) was\r\nachieved within a month, and treatment was downgraded to\r\nintermediate-risk protocol (Figure 1). At the time of writing the\r\nmanuscript, the patient is in the first CR 24 months from\r\ndiagnosis.\r\nThe present report was conducted in accordance with the\r\nguidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional ethical\r\nreview board permission for a case report was obtained and a\r\nwritten informed consent was received from the patient and his\r\nparents.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCryptic NUP214::ABL1 fusion is a rare genetic entity carrying\r\nkinase activating alterations and making the patients candidates\r\nfor TKI treatment. Although ABL1 gene rearrangements are most\r\ncommonly detected in B-ALL, NUP214::ABL1 fusion transcript is\r\nmainly described in T-ALL patients (7–9,11,15), whereas in\r\nTABLE 1 | Cases of B-ALL with a cryptic NUP214::ABL1 fusion.\r\nCase Age/\r\ngender\r\nKaryotype\r\nand/or\r\nkey lesions\r\nWBC,\r\n×109/\r\nL\r\nTreatment\r\nphase\r\nwhen\r\nNUP214::\r\nABL1\r\ndetected\r\nMethod\r\nused\r\nfor\r\ndetection\r\nResponse\r\nto induction\r\ntreatment\r\nTKI use Outcome References\r\n1 26/F 47,XX,inv(9)(p13q34),+10(11) N/A End of\r\ninduction\r\nRNA-seq Corticosteroid\r\nresistance\r\nDasatinib added to\r\nthe second\r\nInduction cycle and\r\nas a single agent\r\nstarted at +35 d.\r\nPost allo-HSCT for\r\n23 months,\r\ncontinued at the\r\ntime of manuscript\r\nCR1 (10)\r\n2 14/M IKZF1 p.Ser402fs mutation;\r\nPAX5deletion;CDKN2A/\r\nCDKN2B deletion\r\n220.7 N/A RNA-seq;\r\nconfirmed\r\nby RT-PCR\r\nN/A N/A N/A (20)\r\n3 16/M 46, XY IKZF1(IK6) and\r\np.Ala79fs mutation\r\n135.6 N/A RNA-seq;\r\nconfirmed\r\nby RT-PCR\r\nN/A N/A N/A (20)\r\n4 15/F 46,XX 260.0 Disease\r\nprogression\r\nafter 1st\r\nrelapse\r\nHigh\r\nresolution\r\nSNP array;\r\nconfirmed\r\nby RT-PCR\r\nCorticosteroid\r\nresistance and\r\nInduction failure\r\nDasatinib in\r\ncombination with\r\nchemotherapy at\r\ndisease\r\nprogression\r\nCR2 after\r\nintroduction of\r\ndasatinib,\r\nhowever, lethal\r\noutcome\r\nbecause of\r\ndisease\r\nprogression\r\n(18)\r\n5 13/F 46,XX, t(2;16)(q11.2;q11.2) 480.0 Post allo-\r\nHSCT\r\nTargeted\r\nRNA;\r\nconfirmed\r\nby RT-PCR\r\nPoor -> allo-\r\nHSCT\r\nNone CR1 (19)\r\nallo-HSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; CR1, first complete remission; CR2, second complete remission; N/A, not applicable; RT-PCR, reverse transcription\r\npolymerase chain reaction; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.\r\nPathology & Oncology Research 3 September 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610570\r\nStukaite-Ruibiene et al. Imatinib Effective in BCR-ABL1-like ALL\r\nB-ALL its expression is described in individual cases only. In\r\nT-ALL, chimeric NUP214::ABL1 protein showed to be sensitive\r\nto TKI in preclinical and clinical studies (11), whereas in B-ALL\r\nthe role of TKI still needs to be established. In pediatric\r\npopulation, approximately 10%–15% of B-ALL cases reveal a\r\nBCR::ABL1-like profile representing a biologically and clinically\r\nchallenging group (3). ABL class tyrosine kinase fusion genes are\r\nexpected to be clonal leukemia drivers and usually respond well to\r\nABL class inhibitors imatinib or dasatinib. Imatinib is generally\r\nregarded as the safest of the TKIs, with no long-term irreversible\r\nside effects. Although many authors recommend second or thirdgeneration\r\nTKIs to override the frequent ATP-binding site\r\nmutations (16,17), in our case imatinib showed a very good\r\neffect, as there was no evidence of ABL1 mutations.\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, only five B-ALL cases with\r\nNUP214::ABL1 fusion caused by intrachromosomal\r\nmicroduplication had been published so far, data are\r\nsummarized in Table 1. The patients reported were teenagers\r\nor young adults, all being >13 years old at the time of diagnosis.\r\nFour patients, for whom data was available, had high\r\nhyperleukocytosis (WBC >100 × 109/L) at presentation,\r\nsimilarly to our case. In all reported cases, the patients had a\r\npoor initial response to therapy and were stratified to very high\r\nrisk (VHR) chemotherapy (case #4) or allogeneic hematopoietic\r\nstem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (cases #1 and #5). Two\r\npatients received treatment with TKI after allo-HSCT and\r\nachieved negative MRD, however, subsequent disease\r\nprogression in case #4 resulted in lethal outcome. One patient\r\n(#5) underwent successful allo-HSCT without additional TKI use.\r\nUnlike in previously reported cases, we initiated treatment\r\nwith a first-generation TKI imatinib mesylate with high efficacy.\r\nTwo cases (cases #1 and #4) reported a second-generation TKI\r\ndasatinib, and a choice of TKI was not specified in the cases\r\n#2 and #3. Mechanisms of resistance to imatinib are known to be\r\nrelated to the mutations of ATP-binding site in BCR::ABL1\r\npositive ALL, therefore, dasatinib, nilotinib or ponatinib are\r\nFIGURE 2 | SNP-A karyotyping analysis: 9q34 amplification delimited by NUP214 and ABL1 genes.\r\nFIGURE 3 | Schematic representation of the chimeric NUP214::ABL1 protein.\r\nPathology & Oncology Research 4 September 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610570\r\nStukaite-Ruibiene et al. Imatinib Effective in BCR-ABL1-like ALL\r\npreferred as first line therapy (16,17). In our case, gene variant\r\nanalysis revealed no TKI resistant ABL1 mutations, which could\r\nexplain a good effect of Imatinib which was added to the first line\r\nof conventional chemotherapy. This subsequently allowed to\r\ndowngrade the treatment to IR-H risk thus evading allo-HSCT\r\nand potentially life-threatening further toxicity.\r\nDetection of cryptic ABL1 gene rearrangements by conventional\r\ngenetic analysis can be a challenge (20, 19). Among the reported\r\ncases, NUP214::ABL1 fusion was identified early in treatment, after\r\nthe first cycle of induction, in one B-ALL case only, using NGS\r\ntechniques (10). In two cases, the fusion was initially missed by\r\nroutine diagnosticmethods and detected later by SNP-A or targeted\r\nRNA sequencing (20, 19) (Table 1). In our case, the ABL1 gene\r\nbreak was initially missed by FISH array (ABL1 Break Apart Probe)\r\ndue to a small 445 Kb microduplication in the 9q34 chromosome\r\nregion and was detected later by performing targeted RNA\r\nsequencing. SNP-A karyotyping missed microduplication which\r\nwas smaller than 5Mb in size (Figure 2). NUP214 and ABL1 genes\r\nare located at the edges of the 9q34 region, therefore, FISH cannot\r\nsuccessfully detect NUP214::ABL1 gene fusion due to technical\r\nlimitations (Figure 3). This particular cryptic fusion mechanism\r\nwas described in detail by Tsujimoto et al. (20). In our previous\r\nretrospective population-based BCR::ABL1-negative B-other ALL\r\ncohort study, we did not detect any ABL-class fusions in pediatric\r\nLithuanian patients (14), making this case to be the only NUP214::\r\nABL1 gene fusion case in Lithuanian childhood B-ALL emphasizing\r\nvery rare incidence of this aberration. Some authors suggest that all\r\npatients with B-ALL should undergo NGS analysis in parallel with\r\nconventional genetic screening (13). In our case, adding TKI to the\r\nfirst line treatment enabled us to downgrade the treatment risk\r\ngroup for the patient. However, earlier NGS results detecting\r\ntargetable genomic alteration would have been beneficial by\r\nallowing initiation of targeted therapy and possibly preventing\r\nsevere drug-induced side effects.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIdentification of rare targetable genetic subtypes is of importance\r\nin order to introduce individualized targeted therapy as early as\r\npossible to improve survival and reduce toxicity. Combining TKI\r\nwith chemotherapy for ABL1 rearranged B-ALL should be\r\nconsidered for the first-line treatment. B-ALL in adolescent\r\npatients without detected recurrent cytogenetic or molecular\r\nabnormalities (B-others) should be immediately analyzed\r\nfurther by NGS methods to prevent from missing atypical\r\ngene alterations.\r\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\r\nThe raw data supporting the conclusion of this article will be\r\nmade available by the authors, without undue reservation.\r\nETHICS STATEMENT\r\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and\r\napproved by the Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos.\r\nWritten informed consent to participate in this study was\r\nprovided by the participants’ legal guardian/next of kin.\r\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\r\nES-R designed the study, collected, analyzed and interpreted the\r\ndata and wrote the manuscript; GV designed and supervised the\r\nstudy, interpreted the data and critically reviewed the manuscript;\r\nRN and VD designed the study, performed genetic analysis,\r\ninterpreted the data and critically reviewed the manuscript; SS\r\ndesigned the study, collected and interpreted the data and\r\ncritically reviewed the manuscript.
