In patients who present\r\nwith a vasculitic rash and strong risk factors for infectious endocarditis, it is\r\nprudent to initiate treatment for suspected bacteremia prior to starting immunosuppression.\r\nHowever, patients may acutely decompensate, which may\r\nwarrant a combined antibiotic and immunosuppressant approach.\r\nDON’T LOSE SIGHT OF GPA\r\nMark Spencer\r\nInternal Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. (Control\r\nID #3707350)\r\nCASE: A 48-year-old female with nomedical history presented with 2 days of\r\ndecreased vision in the right eye. She reported painless blurry vision that\r\nprogressed to near complete vision loss. The vision loss was accompanied by\r\none month of progressively worsening cough, body aches, and subjective\r\nfevers. She denied smoking and reported no sick contacts. Physical exam\r\nwas notable for submandibular lymphadenopathy, bilateral conjunctival injection,\r\nand grossly decreased vision of the right eye. She also endorsed decreased\r\nsensation in bilateral lower extremities distally. Her initial labs showed leukocytosis\r\n(13), thrombocytosis (754), and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR\r\n105 and CPR 359). A chest CT showed bilateral upper lobe consolidations and\r\nscattered mass like opacities bilaterally. Ophthalmic exam of the right eye\r\nrevealed multiple small retinal infarctions consistent with paracentral acute\r\nmiddle maculopathy. A CT head was negative and TTE showed no vegetation.\r\nAdditional testing revealed negative TB, COVID, and normal complements.\r\nInitial ANCA testing was negative, however a repeat test was strongly positive\r\nfor ANCA with PR3 significantly elevated to 428. She was diagnosed with\r\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) vasculitis and treated with prednisone\r\nand started induction therapy of Rituximab.\r\nIMPACT/DISCUSSION: GPA is a small-medium vessel necrotizing vasculitis\r\nand the most common anti-neutrophil- cytoplasmic-antibody (ANCA)\r\nassociated vasculitis. GPA classically involves the upper respiratory tract,\r\nlungs, and kidneys referenced by the ELK criteria (ENT, Lung, Kidney)\r\ncommonly used for diagnosis. ENT findings are present in 70-100% of cases\r\nwith the nasal cavity and paranasal sinusesmost commonly involved. Roughly\r\n50% have pulmonary involvement on presentation, as in this patient, while\r\nonly 10-20% have initial renal involvement. A prodrome of systemic\r\nsymptoms including body aches and fevers is often present. GPA is closely\r\nassociated with c-ANCA, with autoantibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3) positive in\r\nover 80% of cases. This patient did have prodromal symptoms yet her primary\r\npresenting symptom of vision loss was atypical. Eye involvement is not part of\r\nthe diagnostic triad yet it can occur in GPA. When it does present, it usually\r\nmanifests as scleritis, conjunctivitis, or uveitis. Retinal infarctions, as seen in\r\nthis patient, are uncommon and make this case an atypical presentation of\r\nGPA. Additionally, ANCA positivity is related to disease activity and a\r\nnegative ANCA should not exclude GPA from a differential. Not all patients\r\nwill be ANCA positive on initial presentation and 10% of patients with GPA\r\nwill remain ANCA negative.\r\nCONCLUSION: Providers should consider atypical presentations of GPA in\r\naddition to the classic triad of ENT, Lungs, and Kidneys. Renal manifestations\r\nare often missing initially and involvement of other systems, such as ocular,\r\ncan take place.With a positive c-ANCA and high clinical suspicion, treatment\r\nshould not be delayed.\r\nDON’T MISS A BEAT: CAROTID SINUS COMPRESSION BY\r\nMETASTATIC PAPILLARY THYROID MASS\r\nErica Corredera\r\nInternal Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY. (Control ID\r\n#3715409)\r\nCASE: A 61-year-old man with metastatic papillary thyroid cancer presented\r\nwith 2 months of recurrent syncope. The etiology of syncope in this patient was\r\ninitially thought to be orthostasis and he was prescribed midodrine and\r\nfludrocortisone without resolution. Meanwhile, on surveillance imaging for\r\nmetastatic thyroid cancer, there was a soft tissue mass, likely metastatic lesion,\r\nat the carotid space causing high grade stenosis of the ICA with possible\r\nbaroreceptor dysfunction.\r\nThe patient was eventually placed on prolonged remote cardiac monitoring at\r\nhome for ongoing syncope and suspicion of baroreceptor dysfunction from the\r\ncompressive neck mass. The patient was noted to have bradycardia and\r\nintermittent sinus pauses up to 13 seconds. He was urgently admitted to the\r\nhospital and underwent implantation of a dual chamber permanent pacemaker\r\nwith closed loop stimulation.\r\nIMPACT/DISCUSSION: The carotid sinus lies at the anterior margin of the\r\nsternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the cricoid cartilage. Increased\r\npressure or stretch sensed via carotid sinus baroreceptors activates the parasympathetic\r\nnervous system, with the net effect of vasodilation and bradycardia.\r\nThis response can manifest clinically as syncope.\r\nCarotid sinus compression by a neck mass or the invasion of the tumor in\r\npatients with head and neck cancer can cause syncope by initiating this\r\nsequence of events.\r\nThe most commonly accepted definition of carotid sinus hypersensitivity is\r\npresented by the 2017 ACC/AHA/HRS and the 2018 ESC syncope guidelines,\r\nwhich consider an abnormal value to be HR pauses >3 seconds and a drop in\r\nsystolic BP >50 mmHg. These values define the two main subtypes of carotid\r\nsinus syndrome: cardioinhibitory (70-75% of cases) and vasodepressor (5-\r\n10%), respectively. Themost likely pathophysiologicmechanismin the patient\r\ndescribed above us vasodepressor.\r\nImplantation of permanent cardiac pacemaker is recommended in patients with\r\npredominant or pure cardioinhibitory component (ACA/AHA/HRS class I\r\nindication; ESC class Ib indication). Despite this, studies show that 50%\r\nmaintain mild or recurrent symptoms after pacemaker placement. While ventricular\r\ndemand pacing may be effective in managing cardioinhibitory\r\nresponses, vasodepressor responses to carotid baroreceptor compression may\r\nlimit pacemaker utility. Definitive treatment consists of surgical removal of the\r\ntumor responsible for carotid sinus compression, when possible. CONCLUSION:\r\n1. Carotid sinus compression by a neck mass or the invasion of the\r\ntumor in patients with head and neck cancer can cause episodes of bradycardia\r\nand intermittent pauses that lead to syncope.\r\n2. While ventricular demand pacing may be effective in managing\r\ncardioinhibitory responses, vasodepressor responses to carotid baroreceptor\r\ncompression may limit pacemaker utility.\r\nDOUBLE TROUBLE: COVID-19 PNEUMONIA CONCURRENT\r\nWITH COVID-19 ASSOCIATED PULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS\r\n(CAPA)\r\nKomal Khoja1; Marisa Tobes1; Pinky Jha2; Yasir Abdelgadir2\r\n1Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI\r\n2Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.\r\n(Control ID #3710955)\r\nCASE: A 52-year-old male with a past medical history of asthma and uncontrolled\r\nOSA presented to the ED ten days after diagnosis of COVID-19 with\r\nworsening dyspnea. He had a history of fluticasone propionate and fluticasone\r\nsalmeterol use for asthma exacerbations. He endorsed cough, fever, chills, and\r\ndiarrhea, and denied chest pain, leg edema, and anosmia.Vitals showed oxygen\r\nsaturation of 65%. CBC demonstrated leukopenia consistent with COVID- 19\r\ninfection. Blood labs showed hyperglycemia (blood sugar 182 mg/dL, hemoglobin\r\nA1c 9.6%). Bilateral crackles were noted on exam. He was placed on\r\nhigh-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) immediately due to critical hypoxemia. CT\r\nPE was negative; CXR revealed bilateral opacities consistent with COVID-19\r\npneumonia. He started on dexamethasone and remdesivir and was admitted to\r\nthe MICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Notably, the patient had no\r\nknown diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and was started on sliding scale insulin\r\nand Lantus. Barcitinib was added in the MICU in addition to linezolid and\r\ncefepime for fear of bacterial superinfection but were discontinued after\r\nreceiving negative cultures. He was transferred out of the MICU four days\r\nlater after successful weaning of oxygen but soon returned due to worsening\r\noxygen needs. New leukocytosis prompted a repeat respiratory culture, which\r\ngrew mold on the preliminary read. Voriconazole was initiated due to concern\r\nfor Aspergillus infection and was continued with confirmation on the final\r\nread. Repeat CT showed left pneumomediastinum, right apical pneumothorax,\r\nJGIM S447\r\nand worsening bilateral opacities. Despite ongoing treatment, the patient\r\nrequired NC at rest and HFNC with minimal exertion. He was discharged\r\nhome with HFNC.\r\nIMPACT/DISCUSSION: CAPA is a result of opportunistic fungal infection,\r\ncausing devastating disease in the immunocompromised. A crucial risk factor\r\nis the use of high-dose corticosteroids for a prolonged period. The diagnosis of\r\nCAPA is based on a combination of imaging, microbiology, and clinical\r\npresentation. Peripheral nodules, air crescent, reverse halo sign, nodular consolidation,\r\nground-glass opacities, crazy paving pattern, pleural effusion, and\r\npulmonary cysts have been reported among CAPA patients. A fungal culture\r\nand galactomannan test from respiratory specimens can aid in early diagnosis.\r\nThe usual presenting symptoms of CAPA include refractory fever, pleuritic\r\nchest pain, or dyspnea. Voriconazole is a first-line anti-Aspergillus agent.\r\nCONCLUSION: Clinical presentation of CAPA is often subtle but associated\r\nwith high morbidity and mortality. Multiple reports add support to our observation\r\nthat CAPA can be a result of worsening COVID-19 pneumonia. Early\r\ndiagnosis and treatment are vital to prevent worse clinical outcomes.\r\nPhysicians should demonstrate a heightened awareness of the risk of developing\r\nCAPA in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Clinicians should exercise low\r\nthresholds to identify and treat CAPA, especially in patients on high-dose\r\nsteroids long-term.\r\nDOUBLE TROUBLE: SYSTEMIC SYPHILIS WITH HEPATIC AND\r\nCNS INVOLVEMENT ALONG WITH HIV INFECTION IN A PATIENT\r\nWITH LOW-RISK FACTORS\r\nCatherine A. Ostos1,2; Kristina D. Menchaca1,2; Can X. Jones1,2; Shaun\r\nIsaac2,3\r\n1Internal Medicine, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL\r\n2Internal Medicine, JFK Medical Center, Atlantis, FL\r\n3HCA Holdings Inc, Nashville, TN. (Control ID #3715955)\r\nCASE: 53-year-old heterosexual married male in Florida, who worked in\r\nlandscaping and reported recent mosquito bites, with no known medical\r\nhistory presented with daily fevers, night sweats, headaches, and severe\r\nworsening abdominal pain for 2 weeks. Upon admission, he was found with\r\nfever and generalized erythematous blanching rash not involving mucosae.\r\nInitial lab-work with Hb 11.9, WBC 3.8, elevated AST 237, ALT 157, ALP\r\n287, Bilirubin 2.1 (hepatocellular pattern) LDH 1700, and CRP 3.1. CT\r\nabdomen/pelvis with colitis and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. US abdomen,\r\nMRCP, and HIDA were negative for cholecystitis. He continued with\r\nrecurrent fevers despite antibiotics. Hepatitis A, B, C, CMV, EBV, malaria\r\nsmear, dengue were negative. Hematology-Oncology and Rheumatologic\r\nworkup negative for hemolysis, malignancy, autoimmune.\r\nThe patient was found positive for HIV/ AIDS with HIV1-AB, HIV1-p24\r\nantigen-positive, viral load 700k, CD4-count 199. Noticed with RPR and EIA\r\npositive. Lumbar puncture found CSF with pleocytosis, elevated FTA abs,\r\nRPR negative. He started ART and underwent inpatient treatment for systemic\r\nsyphilis with hepatic and CNS involvement, and prophylaxis per guidelines.\r\nIMPACT/DISCUSSION: Syphilis can manifest in a variety of ways making\r\nthe diagnosis and management difficult; therefore, it has been called “the great\r\nimitator”. Syphilitic hepatitis is a rare condition that can be overlooked. The\r\nnumber of cases of syphilis has been increasing over the past 10 years,\r\nattributed to known high-risk sexual behaviors. There is a high rate of coinfection\r\nwith HIV in men who have sex with men. It has been shown that\r\nsyphilis increases the transmission of HIV and increased viral load. In HIV,\r\nprimary and secondary syphilis overlap more often, with early, even asymptomatic\r\nneurologic involvement. Acute HIV infection can present as a constellation\r\nof non-specific symptoms.\r\nIn our case, the patient’s symptoms represented an early manifestation of HIV\r\nwith mononucleosis-like symptoms along with rapidly disseminated treponemal\r\ninfection with high viral load, a phenomenon known to happen when concomitant.\r\nThe only presenting symptom for neurosyphilis was headache and given\r\nimmune status, lumbar puncture confirmed it. The patient was initially treated\r\nwith broad-spectrum antibiotics. Persistent fever warranted workup for other\r\nnon-infectious and infectious (viral endemic given geography and exposure to\r\nmosquito bites) etiologies. This case was challenging to diagnose and can help\r\nclinicians to broaden their diagnosis and consider syphilis as a possible cause\r\neven in patients who do not explicitly have risk factors for STDs.\r\nCONCLUSION: Syphilitic hepatitis is a rare condition that can be\r\noverlooked. Concomitant infection of HIV and syphilis increases transmission\r\nand viral load, and later syphilitic manifestations appear earlier. Early identification\r\nand treatment are crucial to prevent further dissemination\r\nDRESSLER SYNDROME AFTER CARDIAC INJURY: WHY THIS\r\nDIAGNOSIS IS EASY TO MISS\r\nLogan S. Striplin, Maryam Naser, Brian Hurley, Aizaz Khan\r\nInternal Medicine, Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA. (Control ID\r\n#3708556)\r\nCASE: A 73-year-oldman underwent a 3-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting\r\nwith aortic valve repair 2 weeks after presenting with a NSTEMI. Immediately\r\npost-op, he required epinephrine and vasopressin in order to maintain adequate\r\nblood pressures. On post-op day 2, the patient remained hypotensive and was\r\nnoted to have a mild to moderate pericardial effusion noted on transthoracic\r\nechocardiogram as well as a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.\r\nThe patient also started to develop intermittent fevers with no source of infection\r\nidentified. On post-op day 3, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed however\r\nthis did not help increase perfusion. The patient underwent a CT of the chest\r\nwhich now showed amoderate hemopericardium along the lateral wall of the left\r\nventricle. Echocardiography images were further examined, and it was determined\r\nthat the pressures in the right and left heart were similar which was\r\nindicative of a constrictive pattern. On post-op day 4, colchicine and methylprednisolone\r\nwere started, and the balloon pump was subsequently removed the\r\nnext day. The patient’s fevers subsided, and his pressor requirements started to\r\nimprove. On post op day 13, the patient was successfully weaned off all\r\nvasopressors and repeat echocardiogram showed improved LVEF of 50-55%.\r\nThe patient was ultimately discharged on post-op day 20 on a prednisone taper\r\nand colchicine was stopped.\r\nIMPACT/DISCUSSION: The exact pathophysiology of Dressler syndrome\r\nis not well known however it is thought to be an immune-mediated pericarditis\r\nthat develops in response to cardiac damage. This disease has a broad range of\r\ncharacteristics which often make it challenging to diagnose. It can present 3\r\ndays to 6 weeks following insult to themyocardium and can include symptoms\r\nsuch as fever, chest pain, and in some cases a pericardial effusion. If untreated,\r\nit can lead to constrictive pericarditis and even cardiac tamponade.\r\nCONCLUSION: Undiagnosed Dressler syndrome can result in severe\r\ncomplications and poor patient outcomes. This case demonstrated how a rapid\r\ndiagnosis of DS lead to a successful outcome for this critically ill patient.\r\nDRUG INDUCED LIVER INJURY SECONDARY TO\r\nKETOANALOGUE SUPPLEMENT USE\r\nRohun Patel1; Emily Worrall1; David Westrich2; Hany Elbeshbeshy2\r\n1Internal Medicine, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Saint Louis,\r\nMO\r\n2Gastroenterology/Hepatology, Saint Louis University, Saint Louis, MO.\r\n(Control ID #3707854)\r\nCASE: A 67-year-old-woman with hypertension, insulin dependent diabetes,\r\nand chronic kidney disease (CKD) presented with abdominal pain and jaundice.\r\nInitial workup revealed severe cholestatic liver injury as well as an acute\r\nkidney injury (AKI), and enterococcus urinary tract infection.
