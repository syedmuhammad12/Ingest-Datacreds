The world is now entering a\r\nphase of post-COVID-19 manifestations in this pandemic. Secondary hemophagocytic\r\nlymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory event triggered by\r\nviral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Both MultisystemInflammatory Syndrome-Adults\r\n(MIS-A) and Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) are considered close differentials of sHLH\r\nand add to the spectrum of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). In this report,\r\nwe presented the case of a middle-aged Asian man who was initially discharged\r\nupon recovery from severe COVID-19 infection after 17 days of hospitalization to a\r\nprivate institute and later came to our hospital 13 days post-discharge. Here, he was\r\ndiagnosed with sHLH, occurring as an extension of CSS, with delayed presentation\r\nfalling within the spectrum of PACS. The diagnosis of sHLH was made holistically with the\r\nHLH-2004 criteria. Our patient initially responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\r\nand dexamethasone, later complicated by disseminated Candida auris infection and had\r\na fatal outcome. Though many cases of HLH during active COVID-19 and a few cases\r\npost COVID-19 recovery have been reported, based on H-score, which has limitations\r\nas a diagnostic tool. We report the first case report of post-COVID-19 sHLH using the\r\nHLH-2004 criteria, complicated by disseminated Candidemia, emphasizing that the care\r\nof patients with COVID-19 does not conclude at the time of hospital discharge. We\r\nhighlight the importance of surveillance in the post-COVID phase for early detection of\r\nsHLH which may predispose to fatal opportunistic infections (OIs).\r\nKeywords: post acute covid-19 syndrome (PACS), secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Candida\r\nauris, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), intravenous immunoglobulin, cytokine storm syndrome (CSS),\r\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome-adults (MIS-A), hyperferritinemia syndrome\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThe pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has\r\noverwhelmed healthcare facilities around the world. COVID-19 has an extended spectrum in\r\nthe post-acute phase with an evolving list of complications. Prieto-Perez et al. first described\r\npost-COVID-19 secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), indicating a systemic\r\nGautam et al. Post COVID-19 sHLH With Candidemia\r\nimmune-inflammatory disease (1). HLH has been divided into\r\nprimary and secondary subtypes. Primary HLH is familial,\r\nprimarily seen in children, whereas sHLH is an adult entity\r\ndue to underlying infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy,\r\nor “post-allogeneic” hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (2).\r\nHLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory state characterized\r\nbymultiorgan dysfunction, adding to the spectrumof Post-Acute\r\nCOVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) (3). Lledo et al. defined the PACS\r\nas a clinical entity when symptoms persist beyond four weeks (4).\r\nSimilarly, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has formulated\r\n“post-Covid conditions” to describe the health issues that persist\r\nmore than four weeks after being infected with COVID-19\r\n(5). Here, we present the first case report of post-COVID-\r\n19 sHLH occurring as an extension of the cytokine storm\r\nsyndrome (CSS) falling under the timeline of PACS, who initially\r\nresponded to dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin\r\n(IVIG). However, his course was complicated by disseminated\r\nCandidemia and he succumbed to his illness. It is prudent to\r\nidentify this fatal complication early to improve survival.\r\nCase Report\r\nA 36-year-old farmer, who had been admitted 29 days ago to\r\nanother hospital with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, presented\r\nto our emergency 13 days after discharge with complaints of fever\r\n(101.4◦F) for 5 days, generalized weakness and loss of appetite\r\nfor 4 days, progressive exertional dyspnea, and occasional dry\r\ncough for 2 days. He had no history of orthopnea, paroxysmal\r\nnocturnal dyspnea, pedal edema, hemoptysis, chest pain, burning\r\nmicturition, or bowel complaints. He had been discharged from\r\nthe last admission on home-based intermittent oxygen therapy\r\nat 2-4 L/min, multivitamins, and oral pirfenidone (an antifibrotic\r\nagent for post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis) 200mg\r\nthree times a day (TDS). He had no history of substance abuse\r\nor chronic illness, and his family history was insignificant.\r\nHe was conscious, oriented, and febrile (102.8◦F/39.3◦C). His\r\noxygen saturation was 93% under ambient air, a respiratory rate\r\nof 15 breaths per min, blood pressure of 108/76 mmHg, and\r\na pulse rate of 108 beats per min. On systemic examination,\r\nhepatomegaly was present 2 cm below the right subcostal margin\r\nin the mid-clavicular line and bilateral end-inspiratory fine\r\ncrepitations were auscultated in the chest. The rest of the systemic\r\nexamination was normal.\r\nOn investigation, his random blood sugar was 203 mg/dL,\r\nTruNat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was reported negative, and\r\narterial blood gas analysis showed Type 1 respiratory failure.\r\nHis ECG showed sinus tachycardia, and the bedside chest\r\nradiograph showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (Figure 1A).\r\nA provisional diagnosis of post-COVID-19 sequelae with\r\nbilateral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with Type 1\r\nrespiratory failure was made. Further investigations were sent.\r\nHe was treated with low flow oxygen support, antipyretics,\r\ninjectable ceftriaxone, intravenous fluids, and supportive care.\r\nHis preliminary blood investigations showed pancytopenia with\r\nreduced reticulocyte count and transaminitis [Hb-9.2 g/dL,\r\nTLC-3,400 cells/mm3, platelets-20,000 cells/mm3, corrected\r\nreticulocyte count < 0.5%, peripheral smear-pancytopenia,\r\nserum AST-4688 U/L, ALT-6680 U/L, serum bilirubin 0.8\r\nmg/dL, and ALP-186 U/L]. Based on these, possible differentials\r\nwere viral infection, post-acute COVID-19, steroid-induced\r\nimmunosuppression, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) probably\r\ndue to Pirfenidone, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome–Adult\r\n(MIS-A), or COVID-19 associated CSS. Biochemical analyses\r\nhave been tabulated in Table 1. Serum serologies [for HIV 1\r\nand 2, hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),\r\nparvovirus B19, herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus\r\n(CMV), dengue, HSV 1 and 2, VDRL, Rickettsia, Leptospira,\r\nand scrub typhus], peripheral blood smear for malarial antigens,\r\nand serum autoimmune profile (anti-nuclear antibodies via\r\nimmunofluorescence assay) were sent.\r\nFurther investigations revealed an elevated serum lactate\r\ndehydrogenase (8918 U/L), serum D-dimer (> 5,000 ng/mL),\r\nserum ferritin (> 2,000 ng/ml), INR (1.6), and serum fibrinogen\r\nlevels (128 mg/mL), indicating disseminated intravascular\r\ncoagulation (DIC) - like picture with a probably viral, druginduced\r\n(pirfenidone, steroids), or autoimmune etiology.\r\nAntimicrobials were changed empirically to intravenous\r\npiperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g QID) and doxycycline (100mg\r\nBD) with ursodeoxycholic acid (300mg TDS). In light of\r\npersistent pancytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was performed\r\nunder cover of platelets transfusion. Ultrasonography of the\r\nwhole abdomen revealed hepatomegaly.\r\nOn the second day, his dyspnoea worsened, and because\r\nof raised D-dimer, a CT pulmonary angiography of the chest\r\nwas done to rule out post-COVID-19 pulmonary embolism.\r\nHowever, it showed only a consolidation in the left upper\r\nlobe and bilateral ground-glass opacities with no evidence of\r\npulmonary embolism (Figures 1B,C). Furthermore, his troponin\r\nI and T were negative, with normal creatine phosphokinase\r\n(CPK) and N terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT Pro-\r\nBNP) levels. A transthoracic 2D-ECHO was reported normal.\r\nOn the third day, serum procalcitonin was raised (2.5 ng/mL),\r\nbut the blood culture was sterile, and urine culture after 48 h of\r\nincubation showed Escherichia coli susceptible to colistin which\r\nwas initiated. Persistent fever prompted us to send repeated blood\r\ncultures, fungal cultures, urine routine microscopy, and cultures\r\nfor the next 3 days. Sputum induction failed as the patient\r\nhad a dry cough. Meanwhile, all viral serologies were reported\r\nnegative. The patient persistently had transaminitis [AST-11,000\r\nU/L; ALT-12000 U/L; INR-1.6 (refer to Table 1, day-5)], with\r\nno bleeding manifestations or altered sensorium throughout his\r\nhospital stay. Empirically vitamin K, rifaximin, and lactulose\r\nwere added to the treatment. Meanwhile, his serum beta-D\r\nglucan level, galactomannan level, and autoimmune profile,\r\nincluding anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), p-ANCA, c-ANCA,\r\nand thyroid profile, were reported normal.\r\nAfter correlating pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, and DIC, with\r\na consistently raised serum ferritin (> 4,000 ng/ml), serum\r\ntriglycerides (950 mg/dL) and reduced serum fibrinogen levels\r\n(< 150 mg/dL) with an ESR of 23mm (during the first hour)\r\nwith his clinical presentation, we contemplated the possibility\r\nof secondary HLH (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) as\r\npart of CSS due to COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, bone\r\nmarrow biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow for his age\r\n(overall cellularity < 15%), with a possibility of aplastic\r\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 835421\r\nGautam et al.

After\r\ncorrelating the clinical, biochemical, radiological, and bone\r\nmarrow reports, we diagnosed sHLH based on the HLH 2004\r\ncriteria and an H-Score of 256 (Table 2A. Our patient fulfilled\r\nsix of the eight HLH-2004 criteria points with an H-score of 256,\r\nindicating a 99% probability of having HLH (Table 2A).\r\nThe following etiologies for sHLH were considered: a post-\r\nCOVID-19 infection, DILI due to pirfenidone, or sepsis-induced\r\nHLH (compounded by steroid-induced immunosuppresion).\r\nThe close differentials were CSS and MIS-A. Nevertheless,\r\nautoimmune disease, tuberculosis, and other viral etiologies\r\nhad been ruled out. Hence, as per HLH treatment protocol,\r\nintravenous injection of 10mg dexamethasone two times a day\r\nwith 30 g IVIG per day was started.\r\nFurthermore, serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25)\r\nlevels and flow cytometry for immunodeficiency profile were\r\nsent. From day six to ten, our patient responded clinically\r\nto this treatment. Also, no fever was documented, and no\r\nnew lung crepitations were heard on auscultation. Moreover,\r\nimprovements in the biochemical profile and inflammatory\r\nmarkers were seen. Repeated blood, fungal, and urine cultures\r\nwere reported to be sterile (Table 1, from day 6 to 9).\r\nLater, his sCD25 levels were reported positive, and serum\r\nflow cytometry showed a reduction in the percentages of T\r\ncells (CD3: 9.21% vs. 53.2% control), B cells (CD19: 1.32% vs.\r\n7.19% control), CD20 cells (1.06% vs. 7.29%), NK cells (CD\r\n56: 0.13% vs 13.54% control), and CD15 (0.26% vs. 11.71%\r\ncontrol), along with a reduced activity of NK cells, and yet\r\nthe CD4:CD8 ratio was maintained. This report suggested\r\nhumoral and cell-mediated immunosuppression in our patient\r\nalong with low NK cell activity, which was consistent with the\r\ndiagnosis of sHLH.\r\nOn the eleventh day, an erythematous, maculopapular\r\nrash developed, along with fever (101.7◦F) episodes. It was\r\na non-palpable rash measuring 0.5 to 1 cm, on the flexor\r\nand extensor aspects of both arms, hands, face, and upper\r\nabdomen, suggesting a non-vasculitic but infective etiology\r\n(Figure 2). Hence, intravenous teicoplanin was added to cover\r\nmethicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\r\n(MRSA and VRSA) along with the antifungal fluconazole.He also\r\nhad raised inflammatory markers [serum procalcitonin, lactate\r\ndehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and\r\ninterleukin 6 (IL-6)] with deranged kidney functions tests (refer\r\nto Table 1), which raised the possibility of sepsis due to a\r\nnew hospital-acquired infection in an immunosuppressed state.\r\nBlood culture on day thirteen grew Candida auris, sensitive to\r\ncaspofungin. Hence, fluconazole was replaced with caspofungin.\r\nHis fever subsided, but on day fourteen, his kidney function\r\ntests further worsened, and he developed respiratory distress with\r\nworsening hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Similar to CSS, severe COVID-19 infection has\r\nalso been associated with a dysregulated immune response. It\r\nleads to a hyperinflammatory state with elevation of IL-6, IL-\r\n8, IL1b, and ferritin (23). A study showed serum levels of IL-\r\n18, IFNg, sFasL, and serum ICAM-1 were significantly elevated\r\namong patients with COVID-19 compared to those with classical\r\nHLH or MAS, which could guide to differentiate patients with\r\nSARS-CoV-2 induced immunosuppression (24). Our patient\r\nwas previously admitted for severe COVID-19 infection and\r\npresented to us with features of sHLH, which could be attributed\r\nto an extension of CSS associated with COVID-19 due to a\r\nhyperinflammatory state.\r\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome is commonly seen\r\namong the pediatric population after COVID-19 infection (25).\r\nHowever, the CDC (7) has defined a criterion to diagnose\r\nMIS-A in adults as shown in Table 2A. MIS-A presents as a\r\npost-infectious syndrome with an antibody-mediated immune\r\ndysfunction and a varied clinical presentation, but the exact\r\npathophysiology is unknown. (7, 25). The criteria include\r\npatients of age ≥ 21 years hospitalized for ≥ 24 hours or with an\r\nillness resulting in death with the exclusion of bacterial sepsis or\r\nworsened chronic medical condition.\r\nBased on the proposed criteria for MIS-A (7), our patient\r\npresented within the proposed timeline of 12 weeks of recent\r\nCOVID-19 infection.Nevertheless, our patient did not have MISA\r\nas he presented predominantly with respiratory complaints,\r\nlater developed urosepsis, and lacked the required primary\r\nclinical criteria as highlighted in Table 2A. However, our patient\r\nfulfilled the laboratory criteria of a recent COVID-19 infection\r\nalong with raised inflammatorymarkers and one of the secondary\r\ncriteria; thrombocytopenia\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an uncommon\r\ncondition characterized by immune dysfunction, persistent fever,\r\nand hemophagocytosis mediated by activated macrophages (26).\r\nHLH has been divided into primary and secondary subtypes.\r\nIn both, there is immune dysregulation and cytokine storm\r\nleading to multiorgan dysfunction with fatal outcomes (27).\r\nInfection is the most common trigger for primary HLH, and\r\nmalignancy is the most common cause in adults. Moreover,\r\nEBV is the most common infectious agent causing both primary\r\nand secondary HLH. (28, 29). Macrophage activation syndrome\r\n(MAS), a subtype of HLH, is characterized by excessive\r\nactivation of macrophages leading to hyper-inflammation;\r\nand hyperferritinemia (30). Autoimmune and rheumatological\r\nconditions are associated with MAS (31).\r\nThere are case reports of SARS-CoV-2-induced sHLH\r\ndiagnosed antemortem (11–15) and postmortem (1, 16–\r\n19) while the illness is/was ongoing, as shown in Table 2B.\r\nHowever, the literature is sparse about COVID-19 recovered\r\ncases developing sHLH (8–10), as shown in Table 2B. A\r\nstudy focusing on postmortem bone marrow biopsies of\r\npatients with COVID-19 showed histiocytic hyperplasia\r\nwith hemophagocytosis (1). Elie Naous and colleagues\r\nhave mentioned COVID-19-related HLH occuring 2 weeks\r\nafter a documented clinical and biological recovery from\r\nCOVID-19 illness in a 69-year-old woman (8). Our patient\r\npresented 4 weeks after severe COVID-19. He was initially\r\nsuspected of having pirfenidone-induced liver injury with\r\nsuperadded lower respiratory tract infection, on a background of\r\nCOVID-19 sequelae. Pirfenidone-related hepatotoxicity occurs\r\nwith mild to moderate, asymptomatic serum transaminase\r\nelevations. The diagnosis of DILI is based on a high index\r\nof suspicion with the exclusion of other causes of liver\r\ndysfunction (32).

Post COVID-19 sHLH With Candidemia\r\npost-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis but this was stopped during\r\nthe current hospitalization.\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare entity and\r\na diagnosis of exclusion. In our case, after ruling out MISA\r\nand CSS, a diagnosis of HLH was contemplated because\r\nof raised inflammatory markers with persistent pancytopenia.\r\nWe tried to eliminate most of the possible etiologies of sHLH\r\nand thus could attribute it to post COVID-19 infection. The\r\nprobability of HLH was determined by the H-score given by\r\nFardet et al.; our patient had a score of 256 points indicating\r\na 99% probability of HLH (6). Previous case reports on post-\r\nCOVID-19 HLH have relied mainly on H-score with scarce\r\ndata on cytokine levels used in diagnosis for HLH (Table 2B)\r\n(8–10). The use of the H-Score for patients with COVID-19\r\nhas been questioned, and some authors recommend against\r\nusing H-score. This is because of the low sensitivity of body\r\ntemperature and the inability to distinguish between neutropenia\r\nand lymphocytopenia. Furthermore, there is a lack of published\r\ndata on hypertriglyceridemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and\r\nmarrow hemophagocytosis (16, 33). Most patients received\r\nsteroids and had fatal outcomes despite treatment, as shown\r\nin Table 2B. Hence, we based our diagnosis of post-COVID-\r\n19 HLH on the HLH 2004 study criteria. This had a sensitivity\r\nof 91% and a specificity of 83.3% with a PPV of 97.6% and\r\nan NPV of 55.6% (34). The diagnosis of HLH needs any\r\nfive out of the eight criterias: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias\r\naffecting at least two of three lineages in the peripheral blood,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia (≥ 265 mg/dL) or hypofibrinogenemia (<\r\n150 mg/dL), hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or\r\nlymph nodes, low or absent NK-cell activity, hyperferritinemia\r\n(≥ 500 ng/mL), and raised sCD-25 levels (> 2SD) (26). Our\r\npatient met six of the eight criteria mentioned above. However,\r\nhemophagocytosis was not seen in the hypocellular bonemarrow\r\nbiopsy. Although hemophagocytosis is an essential component\r\nof HLH, it is not required for diagnosis. Bone marrow aspirates\r\nrange from normocelluar to hypocellular to hypercellular in\r\nHLH. The prevalence of hemophagocytosis in patients with HLH\r\nranges from 25 to 100% (35), which can also be caused by\r\nblood transfusions, infection, autoimmune disease, bone marrow\r\nfailure, or red blood cell destruction (36–38). The presence of\r\nactivated macrophages in the bone marrow or liver, as well\r\nas a comprehensive clinical examination, may help distinguish\r\nHLH from other causes of hemophagocytosis (39). As shown\r\nin Table 2B, most patients had hemophagocytosis, and 2 cases\r\nhad no evidence of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow. In\r\nour case, bone marrow was hypocellular for age and had < 15%\r\ncellularity. Autopsy evidence of HLH in patients with COVID-19\r\nwas first demonstrated by Prilutskiy et al. (Table 2B) (19).\r\nIn our case, MAS was ruled out after a negative autoimmune\r\nprofile. Also, an extensive viral serology panel was negative;\r\nno apparent malignancy was detected on the CT scan or bone\r\nmarrow biopsy and there was no blood transfusion. Hence, the\r\nclinical diagnosis of sHLH was attributed to COVID-19 based on\r\nthe HLH-2004 criteria and raised H-score. Further, we considerd\r\nPACS in our patient as the patient presented to our hospital\r\nafter 4 weeks of initial severe COVID-19 infection. Here, clinicolaboratory\r\nworkup revealed sHLH after COVID-19 infection as a\r\npart of CSS. Admittedly, in this case report, considering sHLH as\r\na delayed presentation of CSS due to COVID-19 or occurring as\r\nPACS is a debatable point.\r\nThere is also a possibility that sepsis could have triggered\r\nHLH in our patient. Although initial cultures were sterile, E.\r\ncoli urosepsis was detected on the third day of admission, the\r\nvery day we diagnosed him with HLH. A latent, persistent\r\nsubclinical inflammatory state secondary to COVID-19 could\r\nhave led to this presentation. Severe sepsis can present as\r\nthe initial manifestation of HLH and hence, differentiating\r\nsepsis from HLH-sepsis overlap is quite challenging (40, 41).\r\nClinical distinctions between severe sepsis and HLH might\r\nbe ambiguous; prompt detection and management necessitate\r\na high level of suspicion. More than 10% of patients with\r\nHLH die within 2 months of diagnosis due to bleeding in\r\nvisceral organs, opportunistic infections due to neutropenia,\r\nor Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) (35). Our\r\npatient responded clinically and biochemically to dexamethasone\r\nand IVIG. However, due to immune dysfunction related to HLH,\r\nalong with steroid-induced immunosuppression, he developed\r\nan opportunistic infection in the form of disseminated C. auris\r\ninfection. As the initial fungal culture was sterile and the patient\r\ndeveloped rashes on eleventh day, the temporality for causation\r\nof HLH by C. auris could not be established. C. auris has\r\nrecently been linked to major outbreaks of invasive infections in\r\nhealthcare facilities throughout the world (42). It is a multidrugresistant\r\npathogenic yeast that has high mortality rates (43).\r\nGlobally, C. auris isolates are resistant to fluconazole in >90%\r\nof cases and amphotericin B in > 30% of cases (44). Our patient\r\nhad C. auris on culture, resistant to fluconazole, but was sensitive\r\nto caspofungin. Despite treatment for HLH and candidemia,\r\nour patient developed ARDS, was intubated, and succumbed to\r\nthe illness, thus highlighting the lethal sequence of events that\r\nchallenged us in this case.\r\nAs this is a single case report, no consensus on guidelines\r\nand approach to management can be elucidated. More\r\nstudies of such cases are needed to formulate strategies\r\nfor the diagnosis and management of this fatal condition.\r\nEarly detection of HLH among patients who have recovered\r\nfrom severe COVID-19 can be done by looking for the\r\nfollowing pointers in patients (45): (1) ongoing remittent\r\nquotidian fever and being unresponsive to empiric antibiotic\r\ntherapy; (2) hepatosplenomegaly; (3) falling ESR, leukopenia,\r\nand thrombocytopenia; (4) raised transaminases; (5) elevated\r\nCRP/ferritin/triglyceride; (6) hypofibrinogenemia.\r\nFurthermore, with any of the above pointers, a panel of\r\nimmunologic markers (elevated sCD25 and reduced NK cell\r\ncytotoxicity) should be ordered to detect HLH earlier, followed\r\nby guideline-directed treatment.\r\nLearning Points\r\nSecondary HLH occurring in ongoing illness among patients of\r\nCOVID-19 is an uncommon finding. We wish to highlight the\r\noccurrence of sHLH as a delayed presentation of CSS within the\r\ntime frame of PACS.\r\n• Post-COVID HLH is likely under-recognized, and mortality\r\nremains high, especially in adults; thus, prompt diagnosis and\r\ntreatment are essential.\r\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 835421\r\nGautam et al. Post COVID-19 sHLH With Candidemia\r\n• Clinical and laboratory surveillance is necessary for a more\r\nextended period in patients with severe COVID-19.\r\n• For diagnosis of sHLH among patients with COVID-19,\r\nusing the HLH-2004 criteria for diagnosis seems more reliable\r\nthan H-score.\r\n• Indiscriminate use of immunosuppressive agents and\r\npirfenidone among patients with severe COVID-19 may\r\npredispose them to fatal OIs since the patient is already in\r\nan immunosuppressed state due to steroids, COVID-19, and\r\nsHLH per se.\r\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\r\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\r\nin the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be\r\ndirected to the corresponding author.\r\nETHICS STATEMENT\r\nEthical review and approval was not required for the study on\r\nhuman participants in accordance with the local legislation\r\nand institutional requirements.

The world is now entering a\r\nphase of post-COVID-19 manifestations in this pandemic. Secondary hemophagocytic\r\nlymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory event triggered by\r\nviral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Both MultisystemInflammatory Syndrome-Adults\r\n(MIS-A) and Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS) are considered close differentials of sHLH\r\nand add to the spectrum of Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). In this report,\r\nwe presented the case of a middle-aged Asian man who was initially discharged\r\nupon recovery from severe COVID-19 infection after 17 days of hospitalization to a\r\nprivate institute and later came to our hospital 13 days post-discharge. Here, he was\r\ndiagnosed with sHLH, occurring as an extension of CSS, with delayed presentation\r\nfalling within the spectrum of PACS. The diagnosis of sHLH was made holistically with the\r\nHLH-2004 criteria. Our patient initially responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\r\nand dexamethasone, later complicated by disseminated Candida auris infection and had\r\na fatal outcome. Though many cases of HLH during active COVID-19 and a few cases\r\npost COVID-19 recovery have been reported, based on H-score, which has limitations\r\nas a diagnostic tool. We report the first case report of post-COVID-19 sHLH using the\r\nHLH-2004 criteria, complicated by disseminated Candidemia, emphasizing that the care\r\nof patients with COVID-19 does not conclude at the time of hospital discharge. We\r\nhighlight the importance of surveillance in the post-COVID phase for early detection of\r\nsHLH which may predispose to fatal opportunistic infections (OIs).\r\nKeywords: post acute covid-19 syndrome (PACS), secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Candida\r\nauris, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), intravenous immunoglobulin, cytokine storm syndrome (CSS),\r\nmultisystem inflammatory syndrome-adults (MIS-A), hyperferritinemia syndrome\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThe pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has\r\noverwhelmed healthcare facilities around the world. COVID-19 has an extended spectrum in\r\nthe post-acute phase with an evolving list of complications. Prieto-Perez et al. first described\r\npost-COVID-19 secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), indicating a systemic\r\nGautam et al. Post COVID-19 sHLH With Candidemia\r\nimmune-inflammatory disease (1). HLH has been divided into\r\nprimary and secondary subtypes. Primary HLH is familial,\r\nprimarily seen in children, whereas sHLH is an adult entity\r\ndue to underlying infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy,\r\nor “post-allogeneic” hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (2).\r\nHLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory state characterized\r\nbymultiorgan dysfunction, adding to the spectrumof Post-Acute\r\nCOVID-19 Syndrome (PACS) (3). Lledo et al. defined the PACS\r\nas a clinical entity when symptoms persist beyond four weeks (4).\r\nSimilarly, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has formulated\r\n“post-Covid conditions” to describe the health issues that persist\r\nmore than four weeks after being infected with COVID-19\r\n(5). Here, we present the first case report of post-COVID-\r\n19 sHLH occurring as an extension of the cytokine storm\r\nsyndrome (CSS) falling under the timeline of PACS, who initially\r\nresponded to dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin\r\n(IVIG). However, his course was complicated by disseminated\r\nCandidemia and he succumbed to his illness. It is prudent to\r\nidentify this fatal complication early to improve survival.\r\nCase Report\r\nA 36-year-old farmer, who had been admitted 29 days ago to\r\nanother hospital with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, presented\r\nto our emergency 13 days after discharge with complaints of fever\r\n(101.4◦F) for 5 days, generalized weakness and loss of appetite\r\nfor 4 days, progressive exertional dyspnea, and occasional dry\r\ncough for 2 days. He had no history of orthopnea, paroxysmal\r\nnocturnal dyspnea, pedal edema, hemoptysis, chest pain, burning\r\nmicturition, or bowel complaints. He had been discharged from\r\nthe last admission on home-based intermittent oxygen therapy\r\nat 2-4 L/min, multivitamins, and oral pirfenidone (an antifibrotic\r\nagent for post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis) 200mg\r\nthree times a day (TDS). He had no history of substance abuse\r\nor chronic illness, and his family history was insignificant.\r\nHe was conscious, oriented, and febrile (102.8◦F/39.3◦C). His\r\noxygen saturation was 93% under ambient air, a respiratory rate\r\nof 15 breaths per min, blood pressure of 108/76 mmHg, and\r\na pulse rate of 108 beats per min. On systemic examination,\r\nhepatomegaly was present 2 cm below the right subcostal margin\r\nin the mid-clavicular line and bilateral end-inspiratory fine\r\ncrepitations were auscultated in the chest. The rest of the systemic\r\nexamination was normal.\r\nOn investigation, his random blood sugar was 203 mg/dL,\r\nTruNat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was reported negative, and\r\narterial blood gas analysis showed Type 1 respiratory failure.\r\nHis ECG showed sinus tachycardia, and the bedside chest\r\nradiograph showed bilateral ground-glass opacities (Figure 1A).\r\nA provisional diagnosis of post-COVID-19 sequelae with\r\nbilateral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with Type 1\r\nrespiratory failure was made. Further investigations were sent.\r\nHe was treated with low flow oxygen support, antipyretics,\r\ninjectable ceftriaxone, intravenous fluids, and supportive care.\r\nHis preliminary blood investigations showed pancytopenia with\r\nreduced reticulocyte count and transaminitis [Hb-9.2 g/dL,\r\nTLC-3,400 cells/mm3, platelets-20,000 cells/mm3, corrected\r\nreticulocyte count < 0.5%, peripheral smear-pancytopenia,\r\nserum AST-4688 U/L, ALT-6680 U/L, serum bilirubin 0.8\r\nmg/dL, and ALP-186 U/L]. Based on these, possible differentials\r\nwere viral infection, post-acute COVID-19, steroid-induced\r\nimmunosuppression, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) probably\r\ndue to Pirfenidone, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome–Adult\r\n(MIS-A), or COVID-19 associated CSS. Biochemical analyses\r\nhave been tabulated in Table 1. Serum serologies [for HIV 1\r\nand 2, hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),\r\nparvovirus B19, herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus\r\n(CMV), dengue, HSV 1 and 2, VDRL, Rickettsia, Leptospira,\r\nand scrub typhus], peripheral blood smear for malarial antigens,\r\nand serum autoimmune profile (anti-nuclear antibodies via\r\nimmunofluorescence assay) were sent.\r\nFurther investigations revealed an elevated serum lactate\r\ndehydrogenase (8918 U/L), serum D-dimer (> 5,000 ng/mL),\r\nserum ferritin (> 2,000 ng/ml), INR (1.6), and serum fibrinogen\r\nlevels (128 mg/mL), indicating disseminated intravascular\r\ncoagulation (DIC) - like picture with a probably viral, druginduced\r\n(pirfenidone, steroids), or autoimmune etiology.\r\nAntimicrobials were changed empirically to intravenous\r\npiperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g QID) and doxycycline (100mg\r\nBD) with ursodeoxycholic acid (300mg TDS). In light of\r\npersistent pancytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was performed\r\nunder cover of platelets transfusion. Ultrasonography of the\r\nwhole abdomen revealed hepatomegaly.\r\nOn the second day, his dyspnoea worsened, and because\r\nof raised D-dimer, a CT pulmonary angiography of the chest\r\nwas done to rule out post-COVID-19 pulmonary embolism.\r\nHowever, it showed only a consolidation in the left upper\r\nlobe and bilateral ground-glass opacities with no evidence of\r\npulmonary embolism (Figures 1B,C). Furthermore, his troponin\r\nI and T were negative, with normal creatine phosphokinase\r\n(CPK) and N terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT Pro-\r\nBNP) levels. A transthoracic 2D-ECHO was reported normal.\r\nOn the third day, serum procalcitonin was raised (2.5 ng/mL),\r\nbut the blood culture was sterile, and urine culture after 48 h of\r\nincubation showed Escherichia coli susceptible to colistin which\r\nwas initiated. Persistent fever prompted us to send repeated blood\r\ncultures, fungal cultures, urine routine microscopy, and cultures\r\nfor the next 3 days. Sputum induction failed as the patient\r\nhad a dry cough. Meanwhile, all viral serologies were reported\r\nnegative. The patient persistently had transaminitis [AST-11,000\r\nU/L; ALT-12000 U/L; INR-1.6 (refer to Table 1, day-5)], with\r\nno bleeding manifestations or altered sensorium throughout his\r\nhospital stay. Empirically vitamin K, rifaximin, and lactulose\r\nwere added to the treatment. Meanwhile, his serum beta-D\r\nglucan level, galactomannan level, and autoimmune profile,\r\nincluding anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), p-ANCA, c-ANCA,\r\nand thyroid profile, were reported normal.\r\nAfter correlating pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, and DIC, with\r\na consistently raised serum ferritin (> 4,000 ng/ml), serum\r\ntriglycerides (950 mg/dL) and reduced serum fibrinogen levels\r\n(< 150 mg/dL) with an ESR of 23mm (during the first hour)\r\nwith his clinical presentation, we contemplated the possibility\r\nof secondary HLH (Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) as\r\npart of CSS due to COVID-19 infection. Meanwhile, bone\r\nmarrow biopsy showed a hypocellular marrow for his age\r\n(overall cellularity < 15%), with a possibility of aplastic\r\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 835421\r\nGautam et al.

After\r\ncorrelating the clinical, biochemical, radiological, and bone\r\nmarrow reports, we diagnosed sHLH based on the HLH 2004\r\ncriteria and an H-Score of 256 (Table 2A. Our patient fulfilled\r\nsix of the eight HLH-2004 criteria points with an H-score of 256,\r\nindicating a 99% probability of having HLH (Table 2A).\r\nThe following etiologies for sHLH were considered: a post-\r\nCOVID-19 infection, DILI due to pirfenidone, or sepsis-induced\r\nHLH (compounded by steroid-induced immunosuppresion).\r\nThe close differentials were CSS and MIS-A. Nevertheless,\r\nautoimmune disease, tuberculosis, and other viral etiologies\r\nhad been ruled out. Hence, as per HLH treatment protocol,\r\nintravenous injection of 10mg dexamethasone two times a day\r\nwith 30 g IVIG per day was started.\r\nFurthermore, serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25)\r\nlevels and flow cytometry for immunodeficiency profile were\r\nsent. From day six to ten, our patient responded clinically\r\nto this treatment. Also, no fever was documented, and no\r\nnew lung crepitations were heard on auscultation. Moreover,\r\nimprovements in the biochemical profile and inflammatory\r\nmarkers were seen. Repeated blood, fungal, and urine cultures\r\nwere reported to be sterile (Table 1, from day 6 to 9).\r\nLater, his sCD25 levels were reported positive, and serum\r\nflow cytometry showed a reduction in the percentages of T\r\ncells (CD3: 9.21% vs. 53.2% control), B cells (CD19: 1.32% vs.\r\n7.19% control), CD20 cells (1.06% vs. 7.29%), NK cells (CD\r\n56: 0.13% vs 13.54% control), and CD15 (0.26% vs. 11.71%\r\ncontrol), along with a reduced activity of NK cells, and yet\r\nthe CD4:CD8 ratio was maintained. This report suggested\r\nhumoral and cell-mediated immunosuppression in our patient\r\nalong with low NK cell activity, which was consistent with the\r\ndiagnosis of sHLH.\r\nOn the eleventh day, an erythematous, maculopapular\r\nrash developed, along with fever (101.7◦F) episodes. It was\r\na non-palpable rash measuring 0.5 to 1 cm, on the flexor\r\nand extensor aspects of both arms, hands, face, and upper\r\nabdomen, suggesting a non-vasculitic but infective etiology\r\n(Figure 2). Hence, intravenous teicoplanin was added to cover\r\nmethicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\r\n(MRSA and VRSA) along with the antifungal fluconazole.He also\r\nhad raised inflammatory markers [serum procalcitonin, lactate\r\ndehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and\r\ninterleukin 6 (IL-6)] with deranged kidney functions tests (refer\r\nto Table 1), which raised the possibility of sepsis due to a\r\nnew hospital-acquired infection in an immunosuppressed state.\r\nBlood culture on day thirteen grew Candida auris, sensitive to\r\ncaspofungin.

Similar to CSS, severe COVID-19 infection has\r\nalso been associated with a dysregulated immune response. It\r\nleads to a hyperinflammatory state with elevation of IL-6, IL-\r\n8, IL1b, and ferritin (23). A study showed serum levels of IL-\r\n18, IFNg, sFasL, and serum ICAM-1 were significantly elevated\r\namong patients with COVID-19 compared to those with classical\r\nHLH or MAS, which could guide to differentiate patients with\r\nSARS-CoV-2 induced immunosuppression (24). Our patient\r\nwas previously admitted for severe COVID-19 infection and\r\npresented to us with features of sHLH, which could be attributed\r\nto an extension of CSS associated with COVID-19 due to a\r\nhyperinflammatory state.\r\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome is commonly seen\r\namong the pediatric population after COVID-19 infection (25).\r\nHowever, the CDC (7) has defined a criterion to diagnose\r\nMIS-A in adults as shown in Table 2A. MIS-A presents as a\r\npost-infectious syndrome with an antibody-mediated immune\r\ndysfunction and a varied clinical presentation, but the exact\r\npathophysiology is unknown. (7, 25). The criteria include\r\npatients of age ≥ 21 years hospitalized for ≥ 24 hours or with an\r\nillness resulting in death with the exclusion of bacterial sepsis or\r\nworsened chronic medical condition.\r\nBased on the proposed criteria for MIS-A (7), our patient\r\npresented within the proposed timeline of 12 weeks of recent\r\nCOVID-19 infection.Nevertheless, our patient did not have MISA\r\nas he presented predominantly with respiratory complaints,\r\nlater developed urosepsis, and lacked the required primary\r\nclinical criteria as highlighted in Table 2A. However, our patient\r\nfulfilled the laboratory criteria of a recent COVID-19 infection\r\nalong with raised inflammatorymarkers and one of the secondary\r\ncriteria; thrombocytopenia\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is an uncommon\r\ncondition characterized by immune dysfunction, persistent fever,\r\nand hemophagocytosis mediated by activated macrophages (26).\r\nHLH has been divided into primary and secondary subtypes.\r\nIn both, there is immune dysregulation and cytokine storm\r\nleading to multiorgan dysfunction with fatal outcomes (27).\r\nInfection is the most common trigger for primary HLH, and\r\nmalignancy is the most common cause in adults. Moreover,\r\nEBV is the most common infectious agent causing both primary\r\nand secondary HLH. (28, 29). Macrophage activation syndrome\r\n(MAS), a subtype of HLH, is characterized by excessive\r\nactivation of macrophages leading to hyper-inflammation;\r\nand hyperferritinemia (30). Autoimmune and rheumatological\r\nconditions are associated with MAS (31).\r\nThere are case reports of SARS-CoV-2-induced sHLH\r\ndiagnosed antemortem (11–15) and postmortem (1, 16–\r\n19) while the illness is/was ongoing, as shown in Table 2B.\r\nHowever, the literature is sparse about COVID-19 recovered\r\ncases developing sHLH (8–10), as shown in Table 2B. A\r\nstudy focusing on postmortem bone marrow biopsies of\r\npatients with COVID-19 showed histiocytic hyperplasia\r\nwith hemophagocytosis (1). Elie Naous and colleagues\r\nhave mentioned COVID-19-related HLH occuring 2 weeks\r\nafter a documented clinical and biological recovery from\r\nCOVID-19 illness in a 69-year-old woman (8). Our patient\r\npresented 4 weeks after severe COVID-19. He was initially\r\nsuspected of having pirfenidone-induced liver injury with\r\nsuperadded lower respiratory tract infection, on a background of\r\nCOVID-19 sequelae. Pirfenidone-related hepatotoxicity occurs\r\nwith mild to moderate, asymptomatic serum transaminase\r\nelevations. The diagnosis of DILI is based on a high index\r\nof suspicion with the exclusion of other causes of liver\r\ndysfunction (32).

Post COVID-19 sHLH With Candidemia\r\npost-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis but this was stopped during\r\nthe current hospitalization.\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare entity and\r\na diagnosis of exclusion. In our case, after ruling out MISA\r\nand CSS, a diagnosis of HLH was contemplated because\r\nof raised inflammatory markers with persistent pancytopenia.\r\nWe tried to eliminate most of the possible etiologies of sHLH\r\nand thus could attribute it to post COVID-19 infection. The\r\nprobability of HLH was determined by the H-score given by\r\nFardet et al.; our patient had a score of 256 points indicating\r\na 99% probability of HLH (6). Previous case reports on post-\r\nCOVID-19 HLH have relied mainly on H-score with scarce\r\ndata on cytokine levels used in diagnosis for HLH (Table 2B)\r\n(8–10). The use of the H-Score for patients with COVID-19\r\nhas been questioned, and some authors recommend against\r\nusing H-score. This is because of the low sensitivity of body\r\ntemperature and the inability to distinguish between neutropenia\r\nand lymphocytopenia. Furthermore, there is a lack of published\r\ndata on hypertriglyceridemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and\r\nmarrow hemophagocytosis (16, 33). Most patients received\r\nsteroids and had fatal outcomes despite treatment, as shown\r\nin Table 2B. Hence, we based our diagnosis of post-COVID-\r\n19 HLH on the HLH 2004 study criteria. This had a sensitivity\r\nof 91% and a specificity of 83.3% with a PPV of 97.6% and\r\nan NPV of 55.6% (34). The diagnosis of HLH needs any\r\nfive out of the eight criterias: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias\r\naffecting at least two of three lineages in the peripheral blood,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia (≥ 265 mg/dL) or hypofibrinogenemia (<\r\n150 mg/dL), hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or\r\nlymph nodes, low or absent NK-cell activity, hyperferritinemia\r\n(≥ 500 ng/mL), and raised sCD-25 levels (> 2SD) (26). Our\r\npatient met six of the eight criteria mentioned above. However,\r\nhemophagocytosis was not seen in the hypocellular bonemarrow\r\nbiopsy. Although hemophagocytosis is an essential component\r\nof HLH, it is not required for diagnosis. Bone marrow aspirates\r\nrange from normocelluar to hypocellular to hypercellular in\r\nHLH. The prevalence of hemophagocytosis in patients with HLH\r\nranges from 25 to 100% (35), which can also be caused by\r\nblood transfusions, infection, autoimmune disease, bone marrow\r\nfailure, or red blood cell destruction (36–38). The presence of\r\nactivated macrophages in the bone marrow or liver, as well\r\nas a comprehensive clinical examination, may help distinguish\r\nHLH from other causes of hemophagocytosis (39). As shown\r\nin Table 2B, most patients had hemophagocytosis, and 2 cases\r\nhad no evidence of hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow. In\r\nour case, bone marrow was hypocellular for age and had < 15%\r\ncellularity. Autopsy evidence of HLH in patients with COVID-19\r\nwas first demonstrated by Prilutskiy et al. (Table 2B) (19).\r\nIn our case, MAS was ruled out after a negative autoimmune\r\nprofile. Also, an extensive viral serology panel was negative;\r\nno apparent malignancy was detected on the CT scan or bone\r\nmarrow biopsy and there was no blood transfusion. Hence, the\r\nclinical diagnosis of sHLH was attributed to COVID-19 based on\r\nthe HLH-2004 criteria and raised H-score. Further, we considerd\r\nPACS in our patient as the patient presented to our hospital\r\nafter 4 weeks of initial severe COVID-19 infection. Here, clinicolaboratory\r\nworkup revealed sHLH after COVID-19 infection as a\r\npart of CSS. Admittedly, in this case report, considering sHLH as\r\na delayed presentation of CSS due to COVID-19 or occurring as\r\nPACS is a debatable point.\r\nThere is also a possibility that sepsis could have triggered\r\nHLH in our patient. Although initial cultures were sterile, E.\r\ncoli urosepsis was detected on the third day of admission, the\r\nvery day we diagnosed him with HLH. A latent, persistent\r\nsubclinical inflammatory state secondary to COVID-19 could\r\nhave led to this presentation. Severe sepsis can present as\r\nthe initial manifestation of HLH and hence, differentiating\r\nsepsis from HLH-sepsis overlap is quite challenging (40, 41).\r\nClinical distinctions between severe sepsis and HLH might\r\nbe ambiguous; prompt detection and management necessitate\r\na high level of suspicion. More than 10% of patients with\r\nHLH die within 2 months of diagnosis due to bleeding in\r\nvisceral organs, opportunistic infections due to neutropenia,\r\nor Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) (35). Our\r\npatient responded clinically and biochemically to dexamethasone\r\nand IVIG. However, due to immune dysfunction related to HLH,\r\nalong with steroid-induced immunosuppression, he developed\r\nan opportunistic infection in the form of disseminated C. auris\r\ninfection. As the initial fungal culture was sterile and the patient\r\ndeveloped rashes on eleventh day, the temporality for causation\r\nof HLH by C. auris could not be established. C. auris has\r\nrecently been linked to major outbreaks of invasive infections in\r\nhealthcare facilities throughout the world (42). It is a multidrugresistant\r\npathogenic yeast that has high mortality rates (43).\r\nGlobally, C. auris isolates are resistant to fluconazole in >90%\r\nof cases and amphotericin B in > 30% of cases (44). Our patient\r\nhad C. auris on culture, resistant to fluconazole, but was sensitive\r\nto caspofungin. Despite treatment for HLH and candidemia,\r\nour patient developed ARDS, was intubated, and succumbed to\r\nthe illness, thus highlighting the lethal sequence of events that\r\nchallenged us in this case.\r\nAs this is a single case report, no consensus on guidelines\r\nand approach to management can be elucidated. More\r\nstudies of such cases are needed to formulate strategies\r\nfor the diagnosis and management of this fatal condition.\r\nEarly detection of HLH among patients who have recovered\r\nfrom severe COVID-19 can be done by looking for the\r\nfollowing pointers in patients (45): (1) ongoing remittent\r\nquotidian fever and being unresponsive to empiric antibiotic\r\ntherapy; (2) hepatosplenomegaly; (3) falling ESR, leukopenia,\r\nand thrombocytopenia; (4) raised transaminases; (5) elevated\r\nCRP/ferritin/triglyceride; (6) hypofibrinogenemia.\r\nFurthermore, with any of the above pointers, a panel of\r\nimmunologic markers (elevated sCD25 and reduced NK cell\r\ncytotoxicity) should be ordered to detect HLH earlier, followed\r\nby guideline-directed treatment.\r\nLearning Points\r\nSecondary HLH occurring in ongoing illness among patients of\r\nCOVID-19 is an uncommon finding. We wish to highlight the\r\noccurrence of sHLH as a delayed presentation of CSS within the\r\ntime frame of PACS.\r\n• Post-COVID HLH is likely under-recognized, and mortality\r\nremains high, especially in adults; thus, prompt diagnosis and\r\ntreatment are essential.\r\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 835421\r\nGautam et al. Post COVID-19 sHLH With Candidemia\r\n• Clinical and laboratory surveillance is necessary for a more\r\nextended period in patients with severe COVID-19.\r\n• For diagnosis of sHLH among patients with COVID-19,\r\nusing the HLH-2004 criteria for diagnosis seems more reliable\r\nthan H-score.\r\n• Indiscriminate use of immunosuppressive agents and\r\npirfenidone among patients with severe COVID-19 may\r\npredispose them to fatal OIs since the patient is already in\r\nan immunosuppressed state due to steroids, COVID-19, and\r\nsHLH per se.\r\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\r\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\r\nin the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be\r\ndirected to the corresponding author.\r\nETHICS STATEMENT\r\nEthical review and approval was not required for the study on\r\nhuman participants in accordance with the local legislation\r\nand institutional requirements.
