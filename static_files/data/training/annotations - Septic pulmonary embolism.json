We report a case\r\nof SPE and pneumothorax caused by central venous port (CV port) infection.\r\nPatient concerns: A 73-year-old woman, who underwent chemoradiotherapy for a head angiosarcoma and a CV port\r\nplacement, presented with general malaise and myalgia.\r\nDiagnosis: A laboratory examination showed high levels of inflammatory markers. Chest computed tomography showed fluid\r\ncollection around the CV port and multiple ground-glass opacities and nodular shadows in the bilateral lung field. She was\r\nadmitted with a diagnosis of SPE due to CV port infection. The port was removed, and antibiotic administration was initiated;\r\nhowever, she was intubated because of refractory septic shock. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was detected in\r\nthe blood and pus around the port site.\r\nInterventions: Her respiratory status did not improve despite recovering from septic shock, and radiologic findings showed\r\na left pneumothorax and exacerbation of SPE on day 9. Her condition was judged ineligible for surgery for pneumothorax, and\r\nchest tube thoracostomy was continued.\r\nOutcomes: Air leaks persisted after chest tube thoracostomy, and her respiratory status did not improve despite ventilator\r\nmanagement and recruitment maneuvers. Moreover, a right pneumothorax developed on day 19. Her respiratory status gradually\r\nworsened, and she died on day 21. Autopsy showed multiple cavitary lesions in the bilateral lungs and emboli containing\r\norganization and inflammatory cells that obstructed the pulmonary arterioles.\r\nLessons: This case indicates that CV port-related infections are infrequent and difficult to diagnose; understanding the clinical\r\nfeatures of SPE is important because of its high mortality rate; and pneumothorax secondary to SPE is a rare but serious condition\r\nand is difficult to treat during ventilator management.\r\nAbbreviations: CLABSIs = central line-associated bloodstream infections, CT = computed tomography, CV = central venous,\r\nICU = intensive care unit, PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure, SPE = septic pulmonary embolism.\r\nKeywords: case report, central venous port, pneumothorax, septic pulmonary embolism\r\n1. Introduction\r\nSeptic pulmonary embolism (SPE) is an uncommon type of nonthrombotic pulmonary embolism in which infected thrombi\r\nfrom a primary infectious site embolize to the pulmonary\r\nartery, causing infarctions and focal abscesses in the pulmonary vasculature. SPE has been historically associated with\r\ninfective endocarditis, intravenous drug abuse, oropharyngeal\r\ninfection, and septic thrombophlebitis (Lemierre syndrome).[1]\r\nHowever, SPE is now observed in immunocompromised\r\nKI and HG contributed equally to this work.\r\nThe authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.\r\nData sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or\r\nanalyzed during the current study.\r\nApproval of the study by our hospital’s ethics committee was not required\r\nbecause it was a case report.

Various complications such as infection and\r\nthrombosis have been reported because of the implantation of\r\nforeign objects in the body. However, only a few reports have\r\ndocumented cases of CV port-related SPE and subsequent\r\npneumothorax.[2,4,5]\r\n Herein, we report a case of CV port-related SPE with septic shock, respiratory failure, and subsequent\r\nbilateral pneumothorax during chemoradiotherapy for head\r\nangiosarcoma.\r\n2. Case presentation\r\nA 73 year old woman undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head\r\nangiosarcoma was admitted to our hospital presenting with\r\ngeneral malaise and myalgia. She was diagnosed with head\r\nangiosarcoma 7 months prior to admission and was being\r\ntreated with weekly paclitaxel therapy following radiotherapy. Dexamethasone was administered as premedication. A CV\r\nport was implanted in the right subclavian vein 18 days before\r\nadmission (Fig. 1A), and intravenous fluids were administered\r\nthrough this during the sixth course of treatment. After completion of 6 courses of weekly paclitaxel, the angiosarcoma\r\nwas reduced, and no remarkable abnormalities were found\r\non computed tomography (CT) (Figs. 2A and B) and in laboratory findings (Table 1). The patient was discharged without\r\nany symptoms 3 days prior to admission. The following day,\r\nhowever, general malaise and myalgia appeared and gradually\r\nworsened.\r\nOn admission, her initial body temperature, pulse rate, blood\r\npressure, respiratory rate, SpO2\r\n and quick sequential organ failure assessment score were 37.1°C, 133 beats min, 84/53 mm Hg,\r\n33 breaths per min, 92% (ambient air), and 2 respectively. Physical\r\nexamination revealed generalized myalgia with the strongest\r\npoint around the right shoulder. A laboratory examination\r\nshowed thrombocytopenia and an elevated fibrin degradation\r\nproduct and D-dimer level, in addition to high levels of inflammatory markers, compared to 3 days prior (Table 1); sequential\r\norgan failure assessment score was 6. Chest CT showed fluid\r\ncollection around the CV port and multiple ground-glass opacities and nodular shadows in the bilateral lung field (Figs. 2C\r\nand D). She was diagnosed with CV port-related sepsis and suspected SPE. After removal of the CV port, pus was observed\r\naround the port insertion site. The antibiotic piperacillin-tazobactam plus vancomycin was administered after obtaining\r\nblood and pus cultures.\r\nOn day 2, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU),\r\nbecause of refractory shock despite receiving an adequate dose\r\nof crystalloids and high-dose of vasopressors (noradrenaline up\r\nto 0.2 μg/(kg·min) plus vasopressin up to 2 units/h). She was\r\nintubated and treated with corticosteroid and renal replacement\r\ntherapy according to the global sepsis guidelines, in addition to\r\nfluid resuscitation and high-dose vasopressors. Because blood\r\nand pus cultures yielded methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus\r\naureus on day 3, antibiotics were de-escalated to ampicillin-sulbactam. Repeated transthoracic echocardiogram did not\r\nreveal any valvular vegetation or abnormalities. Her hemodynamic status gradually stabilized, and vasopressin as well as\r\nrenal replacement therapy were discontinued on days 4 and\r\n7, respectively. However, more time was required to taper and\r\ndiscontinue noradrenaline (discontinued on day 10). Repeated\r\nblood cultures showed negative results after a week of antimicrobial therapy but showed persistent high levels of inflammatory markers. Moreover, hypoxemic respiratory failure persisted\r\ndespite adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a\r\nlow tidal volume.\r\nOn day 9, her oxygen saturation suddenly decreased to\r\n80% after postural change. Chest radiography revealed a left\r\npneumothorax (Fig. 1B), and chest tube thoracostomy was performed. Her oxygen saturation gradually improved after the\r\nprocedure, but the air leak persisted despite the insertion of 2\r\nchest tubes. Chest CT showed multiple cavitary lesions and infiltrative shadows in the bilateral lung fields, and exacerbation of\r\nthe ground-glass opacity and nodular shadow, in addition to the\r\nleft pneumothorax (Figs. 2E and F). Surgical procedures, such\r\nas video-assisted thoracostomy for left pneumothorax, were\r\nnot indicated due to unstable respiratory and hemodynamic\r\nstatus; therefore, treatment with chest tube thoracostomy was\r\ncontinued.\r\nThe etiology of her respiratory failure was suspected to be\r\nSPE followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition to adequate PEEP and low tidal volume setting, prone ventilation was performed to improve oxygenation (from days 9\r\nto 13); however, her respiratory status did not improve. Right\r\none-lung ventilation was attempted because the left pneumothorax and air leak from the chest tubes persisted. This procedure was shortly stopped due to severe hypercapnia. On day\r\n19, her oxygen saturation suddenly decreased to 80% after\r\npostural change. Chest radiology showed a right pneumothorax (Fig. 1C), and chest tube thoracostomy was performed. Her\r\noxygen saturation transiently improved after the procedure, but\r\nair leakage from all 3 chest tubes persisted. Her respiratory status gradually worsened, and she died on day 21. The clinical\r\ncourse of the patient is shown in Figure 3.\r\nA post-autopsy CT showed bilateral pneumothorax, marked\r\ncavitary lesions, and infiltrative shadows in the bilateral lung\r\nFigure 1. Chest X-ray time course of the case. (A) Recorded before this admission. The CV port was implanted in the right subclavian vein. No obvious lesions\r\nwere found in the lung field. (B) Recorded on day 9. Left pneumothorax was found. (C) Recorded on day 19. Right pneumothorax was found in addition to\r\nexisting left pneumothorax. Left pneumothorax persisted even with the insertion of 2 chest tubes. CV = central venous.\r\n3\r\nIkejiri et al. • Medicine (2022) 101:45 www.md-journal.com\r\nfields. Moreover, a yellowish fluid at the CV port insertion site\r\nwas observed, with microscopic neutrophil infiltration in the\r\nsubcutaneous fatty tissue. Macroscopic findings showed multiple nodular and cavitary lesions in both lungs (Figs. 4A–C).\r\nHistological examination revealed emboli containing organized and inflammatory cells that obstructed the pulmonary\r\narterioles (Fig. 4D), in addition to the obliteration of normal\r\nalveolar architecture and interstitial infiltration by fibroblasts\r\n(Figs. 4E and F). Abscess formation was found in the ventricular wall and renal medulla, in addition to the lungs and subpleura (Figs. 4E and G–I), although findings suggesting cardiac\r\nvalve vegetation, destruction, and infectious endocarditis were\r\nnot observed. The findings of systemic metastasis from head\r\nangiosarcoma are not shown. These findings and the clinical\r\ncourse confirmed the diagnosis of SPE caused by a CV port-related infection.\r\n3. Discussion and conclusion\r\nHere, we report a case of septic shock and respiratory failure due\r\nto CV port-related SPE and subsequent bilateral pneumothorax.\r\nAlthough CV ports are widely used, only a few reports have\r\ndocumented cases of CV port-related SPE and subsequent pneumothorax. We found 5 published cases of CV port-related SPE,\r\nincluding this case (Table 2).[2,4,5]\r\n The mean age of the patients in\r\nthese cases was 46.5 years (range, 32–73 years). To the best of\r\nour knowledge, this is the first reported case of CV port-related\r\nSPE with septic shock, respiratory failure, and delayed bilateral\r\npneumothorax. This case provides 3 important clinical insights.\r\nFirst, CV port-related infections are infrequent and difficult\r\nto diagnose. In the present case, the cause of the infection was\r\nmost likely CV port-related bacteremia spreading from the\r\nport pocket infection since pus was present in the pocket after\r\nthe port was removed. Central line-associated bloodstream\r\nFigure 2. Chest CT time course of the case. (A, B) Recorded before this admission. No remarkable abnormalities were found in bilateral lung field.

Approximately 90% of CLABSIs in the United\r\nStates occur with central venous catheters,[6]\r\n and about half\r\nof CLABSIs occur in the ICU.[7]\r\n A Japanese statistical report\r\nshowed that the incidence of CLABSI in ICU and general wards\r\nwas 1.6 and 1.8 per 1000 days of use, respectively.[8]\r\n However,\r\nthe incidence of CV port-related bacteremia and CV port pocket\r\ninfection was much lower than that of CLABSI (0.016–0.05 and\r\n0.01–0.05 per 1000 days of use, respectively).[9,10]\r\n Based on this,\r\nwe assumed that the possibility of CV port-related infections\r\nis likely to be underestimated in patients admitted to general\r\nwards. When a patient with an implanted CV port develops an\r\ninfection, and there is no obvious source of infection on imaging, clinicians should suspect a CV port-related infection and\r\ninvestigate closely.\r\nSecond, understanding the clinical features of SPE is important owing to its high mortality rate. As mentioned above, immunodeficiency status and implantable devices have been gaining\r\nattention as a risk factor for SPE in recent years.[2,3]\r\n The risk factors for SPE in the present case are presumed to be as follows:\r\nimmunosuppression due to chemotherapy for head angiosarcoma, immunosuppression due to steroids administered regularly as premedication, and less likely, implantable CV port. The\r\nclinical manifestations of SPE are nonspecific: fever (85.7%),\r\nchest pain (48.81%), dyspnea (48.21%), and cough (41.07%).[1]\r\nTherefore, it is difficult to differentiate SPE from other diseases\r\nbased only on clinical symptoms. Radiologic findings, especially CT findings, are useful in the differential diagnosis of\r\nSPE, with multiple nodular opacities (66.42%) being the most\r\ncommonly observed radiographic signs, followed by cavitary\r\nlesions (55.97%), local infiltrations (35.82%), pleural effusions\r\n(29.85%), feeding vessel signs (27.61%), and peripheral wedgeshaped lesions (17.16%).[1]\r\n CT findings in the present case\r\nshowed multiple nodular and cavitary lesions; it was relatively\r\neasy to include SPE in the differential diagnosis. The mortality\r\nrate of SPE is relatively high; 1 systematic review showed that\r\nthe mortality rate was 10.12%, and septic shock was the most\r\ncommon cause of death.[1]\r\n Age, hypotension, and ineffective/\r\ndelay of empirical antimicrobial therapy were found to be independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality.[11]\r\n The patient in\r\nthe present case recovered from the initial septic shock but died\r\nof pneumothorax and subsequent respiratory failure, the etiology of which will be discussed later. SPE should be suspected in\r\npatients with a history of underlying disease if they have fever,\r\ndyspnea, chest pain, and other clinical manifestations, along\r\nwith chest CT suggesting multiple nodules or plaques with or\r\nwithout pleural effusion.\r\nThird, pneumothorax secondary to SPE is a rare but serious\r\ncondition and is difficult to treat when pneumothorax develops\r\nduring ventilator management. Secondary pneumothorax is a\r\nlesser-known complication of SPE; the prevalence of secondary pneumothorax is low (3.4%), but in-hospital mortality is\r\nsignificantly high (28.2%).[12]\r\n The possible mechanisms of pneumothorax due to cavitation of nodular lesions include aseptic\r\nnecrosis resulting from impaired blood flow due to embolization, secondary infection caused by bacterial embolization, and\r\nenlarged airspace formed by a check valve mechanism. Several\r\narticles have reported cases of SPE and secondary pneumothorax,\r\nwith infectious endocarditis being the most common cause.[3,13]\r\nThe cases of CV port-related SPE or subsequent pneumothorax are shown in Table 2. Although 4 of the 5 cases in Table 2\r\nwere positive for gram-positive cocci in the blood culture, no\r\nobvious findings of valvular vegetations or abnormalities were\r\nobserved in all cases. The major difference between the patients\r\nwith SPE-induced pneumothorax reported previously and the\r\npatient reported in the present case is that the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Mechanical ventilation is\r\nthe most common cause of pneumothorax in the ICU setting,[14]\r\nand it is widely known that lowering the tidal volume and/or\r\nPEEP is necessary to prevent barotrauma. However, it is rare to\r\nobserve normal lung function during intubation in patients with\r\nbreathing problems. In this case, the lung parenchyma is fragile\r\ndue to pulmonary lesions associated with SPE and may be more\r\nprone to developing alveolopleural fistula and pneumothorax at\r\nlower pressures than during normal respiratory management.\r\nAfter developing a pneumothorax, the management strategy for\r\npatients with prolonged air leaks while mechanical ventilation\r\nis conservative, including drainage of air via one or more chest\r\ntubes, limited airway pressure and volume ventilator settings.\r\nHowever, in this case, the following 2 conflicting strategies\r\nmade ventilator management difficult. The first was the need to\r\nlower the peak pressure and PEEP to prevent the exacerbation\r\nof pneumothorax and barotrauma. The second was the need\r\nto maintain a high PEEP and several recruitment maneuvers to\r\nprevent pulmonary collapse due to acute respiratory distress\r\nsyndrome secondary to SPE. Consequently, constant inspiratory\r\npressure and PEEP were required to maintain the respiratory\r\nstatus. The fragility of lung parenchyma associated with SPE\r\nwas also a factor that led to persistent air leak and the development of a contralateral pneumothorax.\r\nAt the end of this report, we mention the histological findings\r\nof this case. To the best of our knowledge, only a few references in the literature mention the histological features of SPE.\r\nOne study involving 4 patients undergoing transbronchial lung\r\nbiopsy described 2 histological findings of SPE; suppurative\r\npneumonia: filling of the alveolar cavity with purulent secretion\r\nand marked neutrophil infiltration, and organizing pneumonia:\r\nwidening of alveolar wall, interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells, and disappearance of the alveolar cavity with replacement by hyperplastic fibrous tissue.[13]\r\n Histological findings of\r\nthis case showed obliteration of normal alveolar architecture\r\nand interstitial infiltration by fibroblasts, which were consistent with the findings discussed above. Moreover, we found\r\nnon-thrombotic emboli containing organized and inflammatory\r\nTable 2\r\nCase reports of CV port-related SPE.\r\nAge/\r\nsex Underlying disease\r\nTime from CV port\r\nimplantation to SPE onset\r\nCausative\r\npathogen\r\nDefinitive\r\nantibiotics Pneumothorax\r\nTreatment of\r\npneumothorax Outcome Reference\r\n1 38, F Breast cancer 4 mo MRSE VCM No Cured [2]\r\n2 38, F Breast cancer 4 mo MSSE ABPC/SBT No Cured [2]\r\n3 32, F Carotid body paraganglioma >18 mo MSSA CEZ No Cured [4]\r\n4 43, M Stomach cancer 2 mo Negative AMPC/CVA Right VATS Cured [5]\r\n5 73, F Head angiosarcoma 3 wk MSSA ABPC/SBT Bilateral Chest tube thoracostomy\r\nDead This case\r\nThe patient in reference[2]\r\n suffered twice from SPE.
