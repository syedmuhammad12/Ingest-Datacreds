In addition to\r\nremdesivir and steroids, inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) like baricitinib have been identified as\r\npotential therapeutic agents as they inhibit the signaling pathway of cytokines known to be elevated\r\nin severe Covid-19. Immunosuppressive treatments carry consequences of inducing reactivation of\r\nlatent viral infections like Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), and dexamethasone has been found to do so\r\nin a dose-dependent manner.1 Similarly, studies of HSV reactivation in JAK inhibitor use have\r\nshown episodes of HSV in up to 6% of patients treated.2 Less is known about HSV in Covid-19 and\r\nthe effect of immunomodulation. This case describes a Covid-19 patient who received multiple\r\nimmunosuppressive treatments and subsequently developed a reactivation of HSV. Case\r\nPresentation: A 59-year-old unvaccinated woman diagnosed with Covid-19 was admitted for acute\r\nhypoxic respiratory failure and initiated on high flow nasal cannula, dexamethasone, remdesivir, and\r\nself-proning. She was upgraded to the medical ICU for increased oxygen requirement and received\r\na prolonged course of steroids, a full course of remdesivir, and baricitinib. She required intubation\r\nfor tachypnea and was initiated on a protocol of proning 16 hours per day. She was diagnosed with\r\nadrenal insufficiency, likely due to prolonged steroid course. She was found to have candidemia but\r\nhad no indwelling lines, abdominal source, or obvious other source. Three weeks into her course,\r\nshe was noted to have dark-colored bleeding ulcerations on her lips around the endotracheal tube\r\n(figure 1A, 1B). These were thought to be related to pressure injury from proning. The lesions took on\r\na crusted appearance consistent with Herpes Simplex Virus, which could have been the candidal\r\nportal of entry. She received a full course of valacyclovir as her HSV culture resulted positive, and her\r\nlesions healed well (figure 1C). Discussion: While HSV reactivation is a known consequence of\r\nsteroid and immunomodulator use, its relation to Covid-19 is understudied. To add to this, the\r\nmajority of studies observing the frequency of HSV reactivations after receiving steroids or\r\nimmunomodulators are underpowered. With continually evolving treatment recommendations for\r\nCovid-19, using multiple immunosuppressive therapies may lead to increased reactivation of latent\r\nviral infections. This case displays the importance of keeping a broad differential, and of considering\r\nreactivation of opportunistic infections in critically ill patients receiving immunosuppressive\r\ntherapies.\r\nThis abstract is funded by: None\r\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2022;205:A2475\r\nInternet address: www.atsjournals.org Online Abstracts Issue",{"entities":[[171,255,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[257,259,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[260,267,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[269,330,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[332,350,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[353,375,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[377,386,"REPORTERCITY"],[388,390,"REPORTERSTATE"],[392,405,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[1239,1252,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1329,1345,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1665,1676,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[1690,1695,"PATIENTSEX"],[1789,1812,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[1846,1859,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[1992,2002,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[2008,2020,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[2034,2059,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[2145,2166,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2230,2240,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2708,2719,"TESTNAME"],[2729,2737,"TESTRESULT"],[3466,3512,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"]]}]]}
