He had no signifi\u0002cant history and had never been sui\u0002cidal. Written consent was obtained \r\nto publish the case.\r\nThree days prior to referral, he had \r\nbeen involuntarily admitted to a \r\npsychiatric inpatient unit after being \r\nfound by police, at 11 pm, standing \r\natop a cliff contemplating suicide. \r\nOn review, he denied suicidal intent\r\nbut spoke of feeling ‘too stressed’ \r\nand having needed to ‘get some \r\nfresh air’. Given his recent cancer, a \r\nworking diagnosis of ‘underlying \r\ndepression’ was made. The following \r\nmorning, he was discharged home \r\nwith his wife. That afternoon he saw \r\nhis GP who prescribed mirtazapine.\r\nOn assessment, the man described \r\nfeeling ‘too much stress’ but struggled \r\nto qualify his experience. He denied \r\nany specific cognitions attached to his \r\n‘stress’, but voiced it was unrelenting \r\nand unbearable. He described ‘ten\u0002sion’ in his body – especially in the \r\nshoulders and abdomen. He felt rest\u0002less, fidgety and reported he could not \r\nsit still (e.g. he was unable to sit for \r\ndinner or TV). He denied feeling \r\npervasively low or overtly worried \r\nabout his cancer but portrayed a sense \r\nof bodily inescapability and exhaus\u0002tion. His sleep was disturbed, waking \r\nevery 3–4 h with restlessness. He \r\ndenied suicidal plans or intent but \r\ndeclared he ‘could not go on living \r\nlike this’.\r\nThe patient had commenced chem\u0002otherapy 10 days earlier. He had \r\nbeen prescribed metoclopramide, \r\n10  mg thrice daily – his wife duti\u0002fully administered every dose. Onset \r\nof symptoms was 1–2 days later.\r\nMental state revealed a healthy\u0002looking man with a restless and dis\u0002tressed demeanour. He moved his \r\nfeet several times and stood up mid\u0002review, pacing nearby as we contin\u0002ued the assessment. His affect was \r\ndysphoric and reactive with a lim\u0002ited range. There was no evidence \r\nof delirium, psychosis or mania.\r\nPhysical examination revealed a \r\nmoderate tremor in both hands and \r\nmild rigidity and cogwheeling in his \r\nleft upper limb (wrist and elbow). \r\nHis gait was slow, with a stooped \r\nposture and no arm swing.\r\nThe impression was metoclopramide\u0002induced extra-pyramidal side effects \r\n(EPSE) with severe akathisia and sec\u0002ondary suicidality. Metoclopramide \r\nwas immediately ceased, and the \r\npatient given lorazepam to sleep that \r\nnight. Within 3 days, he reported full \r\nresolution of the aforementioned \r\nsymptoms, including all suicidal \r\nurges.\r\nAkathisia has long been associated \r\nwith suicide.1 Myriad psychotropics \r\nare causal, namely antipsychotics, but \r\nthere are several non-psychotropic \r\noffenders—including anti-dopamin\u0002ergic anti-emetics (e.g. metoclopra\u0002mide).1 In one study, neuroleptic\u0002induced akathisia was correctly iden\u0002tified in only 26% of those afflicted.2\r\nIn another, in patients receiving \r\nchemotherapy (with anti-dopamin\u0002ergic antiemetics), 50% met diagnos\u0002tic criteria for akathisia, yet 75% said \r\nthey wouldn’t have reported symp\u0002toms to clinicians.3 Prompt recogni\u0002tion and management of drug\u0002induced akathisia (psychotropic or \r\notherwise) is critical to prevent iatro\u0002genic harm and, potentially, suicide.\r\nDisclosure\r\nThe author reports no conflict of interest.
