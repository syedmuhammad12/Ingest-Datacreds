Approximately 2 min after the\r\nanesthetic drugs and dexamethasone were administered, her arterial blood pressure suddenly increased from 143/79\r\nto 243/116 mmHg during manual mask ventilation. Since tracheal intubation had not been performed yet, dexamethasone\r\ncould be a causative agent of hypertensive episodes. The surgery and anesthesia were uneventful. She\r\nwas admitted to the intensive care unit to have her blood pressure controlled subsequently.\r\nConclusions: Dexamethasone should be used with caution in patients with adrenal pheochromocytoma on account\r\nof the risk of hypertensive attacks.\r\nKeywords: Pheochromocytoma, Hypertensive attack, Dexamethasone\r\n© The Author(s) 2022.
