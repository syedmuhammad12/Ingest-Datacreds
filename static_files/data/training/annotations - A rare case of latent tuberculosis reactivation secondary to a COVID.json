As we progress towards a “new normal”, more information is required regarding post-COVID-19 syndromes. We present a case of latent tuberculosis\nreactivation 3 months after a successful inpatient treatment of COVID-19. A 74-year-old female from\nthe Philippines presented with a new left mid-lung infiltrate with worsening shortness of breath\nand lethargy for one week prior to admission. The clinical course of the patient deteriorated despite\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, and high-dose steroid therapy requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her sputum culture yielded the microbiological diagnosis of TB. Anti-tubercular\nmedications were started and the patient had a favorable clinical outcome. Our case demonstrates\nthat immunosuppression secondary to COVID-19 and its treatments may promote the development\nof an active TB infection from a latent infection. It is important to be aware of this potential increase\nin risk during and after a COVID-19 treatment. This is especially important in high-risk populations\nto ensure an early diagnosis and prompt management as well as to reduce transmission.\n\nProl, R.; Rawat, S.; Khunger, A.;\nBromberg, R.

Introduction\n\nAcademic Editor: Nicola Petrosillo\n\nWith nearly 180 million cases, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has\nsignificantly strained healthcare systems worldwide. Approximately 15–30% of patients\ncan develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and lung recruitment strategies to overcome profound hypoxemia [1]. Currently,\nimmunomodulators have shown the most promise in reducing the morbidity and mortality\nof COVID-19 [2–5]. However, with the increased use of these medications, there is a heightened concern for immunosuppression and superinfections. In addition, COVID-19 has\nbeen shown to cause lymphopenia and impair cytokine circulation during the hyperinflammatory phase of the illness, which may increase the risks of concomitant infections [6,7].\nIn the past, superinfections in the acute setting were linked to increased ICU admissions,\nhospital length of stay, and mortality. Furthermore, this level of immunosuppression puts\npatients at an increased risk of bacterial, fungal, viral, and opportunistic infections.\nTuberculosis (TB) remains the number one infectious cause of death worldwide despite\nglobal efforts to eradicate the disease. Approximately 25% of the global population has\na latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with an estimated 5–15% lifetime activation risk [8].\nAs countries proceed towards a “new normal”, there may be an increased incidence of TB\nsecondary to active or recovered COVID-19 infections, whether or not immunosuppressant\nmedications are used. Additionally, given that patient access to screening and treatment of\nTB may be affected by strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, there could be delays\n\nReceived: 11 May 2022\nAccepted: 8 June 2022\nPublished: 12 June 2022\nPublisher’s Note: MDPI stays neutral\nwith regard to jurisdictional claims in\npublished maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nCopyright: © 2022 by the authors.\nLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\nThis article is an open access article\ndistributed under the terms and\nconditions of the Creative Commons\nAttribution (CC BY) license (https://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/\n4.0/).\n\nInfect.

Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) has recommended simultaneous testing for TB and COVID-19 when\nindicated as part of their strategy to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the spread\nof TB [8]. Screening for LTBI prior to or after a treatment for COVID-19 is not currently\nrecommended in the guidelines for COVID-19 management. This paper describes a case of\nactive TB presenting shortly after a successful treatment of COVID-19.\n2. Case Presentation\nA 74-year-old Filipino female with a medical history significant for hypertension,\nhyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent type II diabetes presented to the emergency\ndepartment (ED) of a South Florida hospital with a one-week history of increased generalized weakness and worsening shortness of breath. Three months prior, the patient was\ntreated in the hospital for COVID-19 with intravenous dexamethasone and remdesivir,\nand was discharged home with oxygen. She fully recovered to her baseline and no longer\nrequired supplemental oxygen two months before the above onset of symptoms. On arrival\nto the ED, she was lethargic, but not in severe distress. She had an oral temperature of\n37.5 ◦ C, a heart rate of 97 beats/min, blood pressure of 133/78 mmHg, a respiratory rate of\n20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 3 L nasal cannula supplemental oxygen.\nShe had decreased breath sounds bilaterally and rales at the bases. Her heart sounds were\ndistant without any murmurs and she had no peripheral edema. The initial laboratory\nresults are available in Table 1. Her chest X-ray showed a left mid-lung infiltrate that was\nnew compared with the X-ray three months prior (Figure 1). The computed tomography\n(CT) chest scan with IV contrast showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism. However,\nit revealed significant bilateral infiltrates (Figure 2) that had progressed from her previous\nCT chest scan three months prior (Figure 3). Her echocardiogram revealed an ejection\nfraction of 39% and no other structural abnormalities.\nTable 1.

Rep. 2022, 14\n\n449\n\nThroughout the hospitalization, her hypoxemia worsened for which she required\nBiPAP and subsequently developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of the patient was thought to be\nmultifactorial and was empirically treated with diuretics, antibiotics, and steroids for a\nsuspected pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia vs. nitrofurantoin-induced pneumonitis as the\npatient received nitrofurantoin for a UTI one week before arrival to the ED. She was also\ntreated with therapeutic enoxaparin for a non-ST elevation MI although it was likely due to\ndemand ischemia in the setting of severe pulmonary disease. She remained febrile despite\noptimal treatment, prompting a further workup including a lumbar puncture 15 days after\nadmission; however, the CSF findings were unrevealing for an infectious etiology. The\npatient had a worsening clinical course requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.\nAn induced sputum culture sample obtained after intubation showed a positive AFB smear\nand positive PCR for a Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) complex. Subsequent induced\nsputum cultures were also positive for MTB, confirming the diagnosis of TB.\nInitially, the treatment regimen was rifamycin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE therapy) for MTB. However, the patient developed transaminitis within a\nfew days so she started second-line therapy (linezolid, isoniazid with vitamin B6, and\nlevofloxacin). The patient was also placed on pulse-dose steroids for presumed immune\nreconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with\natovaquone. In order to improve efficacy, rifabutin was added, but ultimately the regimen\nwas changed to ethambutol, rifabutin, and levofloxacin due to ongoing hepatotoxicity.\nEventually, the respiratory status of the patient improved so she underwent a tracheostomy\nplacement and subsequently improved enough to have the tracheostomy closed. Finally,\nthe patient was discharged to a specialized TB inpatient center to complete six months of\nMTB treatment with rifabutin, levofloxacin, and ethambutol.\n3. Discussion\nThe above case illustrates the likely risk of a LTBI reactivation in a patient who had\nrecently recovered from COVID-19 treated with steroids and remdesivir. Possible causes\nwere the immunosuppressive sequelae of COVID-19, the effects of the treatment, or a\ncombination of both. In any case, it is essential to consider the risk of a TB infection when\ntreating COVID-19 patients, especially those who have emigrated from TB-endemic areas.\nFor example, the patient presented in this case was an immigrant from the Philippines\nwithout other risk factors or known recent exposures. Therefore, the most likely conclusion\nwas that it was a reactivation of LTBI triggered by COVID-19 rather than acute TB.\nAlthough TB is less common in the United States (US) than in the rest of the world,\nit is not rare, especially in areas with large immigrant populations. In 2018, the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 9029 new cases of TB in the US with\ntwo-thirds of cases in non-US-born people (a rate 14 times greater than US-born people),\nand 591 cases in the state of Florida [9]. Unfortunately, although it is required to report\ncases of active TB to the CDC, it is not required for cases of LTBI. Therefore, there are\nonly incidence/prevalence estimates provided by the CDC via the National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which includes a medical examination and TB\nscreening tests; these data are extrapolated to the civilian population. In 2015, the estimated\nnational prevalence of LTBI in the US was 13.2 million [10].\nRecently, it has been shown that COVID-19 infections affect the innate immune system\nand T cells, which are essential to prevent LTBI reactivation. For example, studies have\nshown that SARS-CoV-2 can cause T cell dysfunction and cytokine storms, leading to\nimmunosuppression. Patients with COVID-19 have decreased numbers of lymphocytes,\nspecifically CD4 and CD8 T cells; there is evidence that these cells undergo “exhaustion”,\nbecoming dysfunctional/ineffective, and express an increased level of immune-inhibitory\nfactors on their surface. These patients also tend to have increased levels of cytokines\nsuch as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 [6,11]. One case series showed that 46.4% of patients with\nCOVID-19 developed a secondary infection with respiratory and bloodstream infections\n\n\fInfect. Dis. Rep. 2022, 14\n\n450\n\nbeing the most common source; this risk was higher in patients receiving corticosteroids,\nbut was also present in patients who did not receive corticosteroids. However, this case\nseries had a high number of severe and critically ill patients, so it may not be representative\nof all COVID-19 infections [6]. Previous studies in mice have shown that a depletion of CD4\nT cells is associated with the reactivation of LTBI. CD4 T cells are critical to the cytotoxic\nfunction of CD8 T cells via cytokines, and a depletion of CD8 T cells has also been associated\nwith the reactivation of LTBI [12]. Multiple viruses—including other coronaviruses such as\nSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as viruses such as HIV, influenza, and measles—have\nbeen shown to increase the risk of a reactivation of LTBI [13–15]. Other case series in\nTB-endemic areas such as China and Italy have increasingly documented COVID-19 and\nactive TB co-infections. The majority of the current studies focus on co-infections or an\nincreased risk of COVID-19 in patients with TB and vice versa, but little is documented on\nLTBI reactivation after recovery. In a study looking at patients with SARS-CoV, their cell\ncounts took up to three months to normalize for CD8 T cell counts and up to one year for\nCD4 T cells [16]. Therefore, it is possible that an infection with SARS-CoV-2 alone could\nput patients with LTBI at an increased risk of reactivation. There are two other separate\ncase reports of patients that developed an active TB infection several weeks after recovery\nfrom COVID-19 and these patients likely had LTBI (both were from endemic areas and\none had a known exposure via a household contact two years prior; neither patient had\npreviously been tested or treated for LTBI) [17,18].\nAdditionally, the treatment for patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental\noxygen is steroids, which also have immunosuppressive effects. The Infectious Disease\nSociety of America (IDSA) guidelines for COVID-19 treatment recommend corticosteroids\nfor a critical illness or severe non-critical illness as well as tocilizumab, which directly\nblocks the IL-6 receptor, for severe disease with signs of systemic inflammation [19]. Corticosteroids mainly cause immunosuppression via effects on the function of phagocytes and\ntemporary reductions in lymphocytes, which are necessary for preventing LTBI from reactivating via granuloma formation and other activities [20]. There are limited data regarding\nwhether tocilizumab increases the risk of an active TB infection, but corticosteroids have\nbeen shown to increase the risk of new TB infections and the reactivation of LTBI, usually\nwith prolonged and high-dose courses. If a patient is going to be on a prolonged course of\nhigh-dose corticosteroids and has an increased risk of LTBI, it is recommended that they be\nscreened with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing [21]. The same\nprinciple may need to be considered for patients treated for COVID-19.\n4. Conclusions\nIn short, we present a case of TB in the US of a patient from the Philippines who\nrecovered from a COVID-19 infection treated with corticosteroids and remdesivir and\nsubsequently developed TB three months after recovery. Given the history and patient\nrisk factors, this was likely a reactivation of LTBI rather than a new acute TB infection.\nThere are currently no guidelines regarding whether screening for TB should be considered\nin patients with COVID-19, whether they receive treatment with steroids or tocilizumab.\nHowever, it seems that, given the increasing number of case reports regarding a co-infection\nwith TB and the possible reactivation of LTBI, it may be prudent to begin screening highrisk patients with COVID-19, especially severe cases that require treatment. There are\nincreasing data in the literature regarding co-infections of COVID-19 and TB, but a paucity\nof data regarding the possible reactivation of LTBI long after treatment and recovery from\nCOVID-19; this will need further investigation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.-A.L., K.B., R.P., S.R., A.K. and R.B.; writing—original\ndraft preparation, A.-A.L., K.B., R.P. and S.R.; writing—review and editing, A.-A.L., K.B., A.K. and\nR.B.
