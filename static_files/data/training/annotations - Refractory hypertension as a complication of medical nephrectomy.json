Reported side\r\neffects of this approach include hypotension, elevated liver enzymes and reversible\r\nhypertension during treatment. We report a case with persistent refractory hypertension\r\nafter medical nephrectomy. Material and methods: Case Report Results: Steroid\r\nresistant nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed in a 1.5-year-old boy. Renal biopsy\r\nrevealed FSGS. Genetic evaluation showed homozygote pathogenic NPHS2 mutation\r\n(c.353C>T, p.P118L). End stage kidney disease developed at 10 years of age. As he\r\nstill had proteinuria (11 g/day) and hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g/dL) at this stage, medical\r\nnephrectomy was performed by cyclosporine A (2x75mg), indomethacin (2x25 mg) and\r\nenalapril (1x10 mg) for 7 days before pre-emptive living related renal transplantation.\r\nAfter renal transplantation proteinuria resolved, but he developed severe hypertension\r\n(160/100 mmHg) that was refractory to medical therapy with combination of three\r\nantihypertensive drugs. Plasma renin (298 pg/mL; range 6-58) and aldosterone (1180\r\npg/mL; range 35-300) levels were greatly elevated. Graft functions including MR\r\nangiography and DMSA scan were normal. Bilateral native nephrectomy was performed\r\nafter 2.5 years of follow up. Pathologically there was sclerotic glomeruli, thickened\r\narteriolar wall, microcalcification, tubular atrophy and chronic mixed inflammatory cell\r\ninfiltrates. Blood pressure, renin and aldosterone levels decreased immediately after the\r\noperation and the patient did not need antihypertensive drugs anymore. Conclusions:\r\nMedical nephrectomy for stopping proteinuria before transplantation has been used in\r\npatients with persistent nephrotic syndrome. Transient hypertension has been reported\r\nin a case given IV cyclosporine and IV angiotensin 2 infusion. Our case indicates that\r\nthe drugs used formedical nephrectomymight cause injury in native nephrotic kidneys\r\nleading to high renin hypertension after transplantation.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n podocin\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\n aldosterone; angiotensin II; antihypertensive agent; cyclosporine; enalapril;\r\nendogenous compound; indometacin; renin; succimer\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n gene mutation; nephrectomy; nephrotic syndrome; resistant hypertension\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\n atrophy; blood pressure; case report; cell infiltration; child; clinical article;\r\ncomplication; conference abstract; congenital nephrotic syndrome; drug combination;\r\nRecord downloaded - Mon 11 21 02:22:08 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nend stage renal disease; focal glomerulosclerosis; follow up; gene frequency;\r\nhomozygote; human; human tissue; hypertension; hypoalbuminemia; infant;\r\ninflammatory cell; injury; kidney biopsy; kidney transplantation; magnetic resonance\r\nangiography; male; microcalcification; nephrosis; plasma renin activity; proteinuria;\r\nschool child; side effect; surgery\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\n aldosterone (52-39-1, 6251-69-0)\r\n angiotensin II (11128-99-7, 68521-88-0)\r\n cyclosporine (59865-13-3, 63798-73-2, 79217-60-0)\r\n enalapril (75847-73-3)\r\n indometacin (53-86-1, 74252-25-8, 7681-54-1)\r\n podocin (273720-08-4)\r\n renin (61506-93-2, 9015-94-5)\r\n succimer (10008-75-0, 2418-14-6, 2922-54-5, 304-55-2)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\n English\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\n English\r\nPUI\r\n L639292987\r\nDOI\r\n 10.1007/s00467-022-05630-1\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00467-022-05630-1\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L639292987&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.
