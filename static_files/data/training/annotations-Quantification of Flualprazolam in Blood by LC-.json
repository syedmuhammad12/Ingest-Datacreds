It was initially identified in 2017. User forums suggest it is slightly\nmore potent than alprazolam and has longer-lasting central nervous system depressant effects.\nHere we report a simple, sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method\nfor flualprazolam and report a series of nine cases in which flualprazolam was quantified. As is\ntypical of forensic toxicology in the twenty-first century, all the cases had more than one drug\npresent. None of the deaths could be directly attributed to flualprazolam alone, but all were likely\ndue to a combination of sedative drugs. However, this paper still adds to the data available to allow\ninterpretation of postmortem flualprazolam concentrations.\n\nIntroduction\nFlualprazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative that was first synthesized in 1976 (1) but was never marketed. It was initially identified in\nseized samples in Germany 2017 and notified by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction February 2018 (2). It\nis the 2′ -fluoro derivative of alprazolam, but it is also an analog of\ntriazolam, with the fluoro replacing the chloro moiety.\nThe unrelenting evolution of novel psychoactive substance (NPS)\nmisuse continues to present an unprecedented analytical and clinical\nchallenge for analytical scientists and policymakers alike. It had previously been proposed that benzodiazepines have relatively low acute\ntoxicity and so would not result in serious toxicological problems.\nHowever, some new designer benzodiazepines which are analogs of\nexisting benzodiazepine drugs have been reported to be more potent,\nexhibiting effects on the central nervous system which are not to be\nignored. These include drugs such as etizolam, deschloroetizolam,\npyrazolam, diclazepam, nifoxipam, phenazepam and flubromazolam. Effects observed in peer-reviewed case reports to date include\nsevere life-threatening toxicity, contribution and causality in death\nas well as lack of judgment and impaired decision-making ability (3); this is a particularly important consideration when these\ndrugs are taken in combination with other central nervous system\n\ndepressants (4–10). Flualprazolam is emerging as another such\npotent benzodiazepine.\nUser forums suggest it is slightly more potent than alprazolam\nand significantly more potent than diazepam (11, 12). The predominant reported characteristics included heavy hypnotic and sedative\neffects, long-lasting amnesiac effects and rapid development of tolerance. Like other benzodiazepine drugs, flualprazolam also exerted\nanxiolytic and muscle relaxant effects for many users, with some\nusers experiencing intense euphoria. Other prominent characteristics\nincluded lack of judgment, impaired decision-making ability often\nalong with severe withdrawal symptoms. Severe symptoms have led\nsome users to be admitted to hospital for acute psychiatric treatment\nor to be taken into police custody.\nFlualprazolam has been implicated in drug-facilitated crimes\nwhere it was identified in solutions that may have been administered\nbut not in body fluids (13).\nFlualprazolam has very recently been reported as implicated in\na series of deaths in Finland and Sweden. Quantitation was by gas\nchromatography–mass spectrometry (MS) (14). Flualprazolam was\nimplicated in the cause of death for 13 cases of the 33 cases described.\nIn two cases, flualprazolam alone was detected. Our paper reports\nnine postmortem cases in which flualprazolam was detected and\n\n© The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

None of\nthe deaths were directly attributable to flualprazolam alone as there\nwere multiple drugs implicated, and none of our cases contained\nflualprazolam alone.\n\nMethods\nCase selection\n\nDrug calibrators and internal standards preparation\nStock solutions of flualprazolam (1 mg/mL in methanol) were purchased from Chiron (Chiron AS, Trondheim, Norway). Five calibration standards (200, 100, 50, 10 and 1.0 ng/mL) were prepared\nby appropriate dilution of the stock solutions in blank, sterile horse\nserum (TCS Biosciences LTD, Buckingham, UK). Internal quality\ncontrol (QC) at two levels (15 and 75 ng/mL) was independently\nprepared in the same way. Levels for QC were chosen to reflect a\nmidpoint in the therapeutic range (15 ng/mL) and a point above the\ntherapeutic range (75 ng/mL) for alprazolam as defined therapeutic and toxic ranges for flualprazolam are not defined. Deuterated\ndiazepam (diazepam-d5 ) was used an internal standard (Cerilliant)\nat a working concentration of 100 ng/mL in HPLC-grade acetonitrile\n(Fisher Chemicals).\n\nDr. Stephen Morley, University Hospital Leicester, Leicester, GB, GB\n<literaturereference- Rice K, Hikin L, Lawson A, Smith PR, Morley S.

Extracts were analyzed using a Waters G2-XS\nquadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to a Waters\nAcquity I-Class UPLC system. Instrument control was performed\nusing UNIFI running the Waters Forensic Toxicology method (15).\nSamples were analyzed in both positive and negative ionization\nmodes. Drugs present in samples were identified by retention time,\nmass and characteristic fragment ions when compared to a library.\nCriteria for positive identification of drugs were a retention time\n(±0.1 min) when compared to the Waters Toxicology Library and\nmass error (±5 ppm) when compared to the assigned molecular formula at low energy. At high energy, presence of at least one accurate\nfragment ion present in the Waters Toxicology Library was needed\nfor further confirmatory purposes. Intensity of the low energy peak\nhad to be >1,000 counts.\n\nQuantitative analysis\nSample preparation\nStandards, QCs or samples (50 µL) were manually pipetted into 1.5mL micro-centrifuge tubes (Biomedical, Birmingham, UK). To this,\n200 µL of internal standard was added, and samples were vortexmixed for 5 seconds. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g\nfor 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to 1.1 mL snap top\n\nvials with integrated 0.2 mm glass inserts (Kinesis Solutions, Cambridgeshire, UK) and loaded into the autosampler for analysis.\nA total of 10 µL of sample was injected and analyzed by liquid\nchromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.\nLiquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry\nThe instrumentation consisted of a Shimadzu high-performance liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu, Milton Keynes, UK) and an API\n4000 tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Warrington, UK) using\nan electrospray-ionization ion source. The column used was a\nHypersil Gold column (1.9 µm, 100 mm × 2.1 mm) (Thermo\nScientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) with a Gemini C-18 Guard Column (4 × 3 mm) (Phenomenex, Cheshire, UK) both maintained at\n60◦ C. The mobile phases utilized were (A) HPLC-grade water containing 0.1% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate (Sigma)\nand (B) 90% HPLC-grade acetonitrile (Fisher Chemicals) containing\n0.1% formic acid and 1 mM ammonium formate. Gradient elution was employed for the analysis with the proportion of mobile\nphase B being maintained at 20% for 0.25 min, and then increased\nto 80% by 3.4 min and held at 80% for 0.1 min. Percentage\nmobile phase B was then reduced to 20% for 0.5 min giving a\ntotal run time of 4.0 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. Transitions used were 327.8 > 300.2 for flualprazolam and 290.0 > 196.0\nfor internal standard (diazepam-d5 ); with collision energies of 38\nand 44 V, respectively. Generic settings were as follows: declustering potential 100 = V, entrance potential = 10 V, collision cell exit\npotential = 10 V, collision gas = 9 V, curtain gas = 40 V, ion source\ngas 1 = 40 V, ion source gas = 55 V, ion spray voltage = 5500 V,\ntemperature = 400◦ C. V, volts. Representative chromatographs can\nbe seen in Figure 1. Retention times were 2.79 for flualprazolam and\n3.30 for diazepam-d5 .\n\nMethod validation\nSelectivity\nDrug-free blood samples from six healthy volunteers and a drugfree blood sample spiked with a mixture of commonly prescribed medications were processed and analyzed to test the selectivity of the method. Medications spiked into blood were tramadol, olanzapine, cyclizine, quetiapine, codeine, nordiazepam,\nBenzoylecgonine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, morphine, 2-ethylidene1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), cocaine, oxazepam,\ndiazepam, temazepam, methadone, buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol, ketamine, alprazolam, citalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine and fluoxetine. The lack of peaks at retention times expected for analytes indicated acceptable selectivity and an absence of interfering substances\nin the blood.\nLinearity and lower limit of quantitation\nCalibration standards at five concentration levels were freshly prepared as outlined above. The linearity of the assay was calculated by\na least-squares linear regression analysis of the peak area ratios of\nanalyte to internal standard versus nominal analyte concentration.\nThe regression parameters of slope, intercept and correlation\ncoefficient were calculated by the weighting factor, 1/x2 . Linearity\nwas assessed separately in triplicate using the coefficient of determination (r2 ) and by determining the error between nominal and\nmeasured concentration for each point on the calibration curve. An\nacceptable r2 value was deemed to be >0.98.\n\nDr. Stephen Morley, University Hospital Leicester, Leicester, GB, GB\n<literaturereference- Rice K, Hikin L, Lawson A, Smith PR, Morley S.

He was on a methadone program. Postmortem fluoride oxalate\npreserved and unpreserved femoral blood and urine samples were\nreceived. The unpreserved sample contained morphine 62 ng/mL,\ncodeine 14 ng/mL, methadone 694 ng/mL, EDDP 365 ng/mL, alprazolam 68 ng/mL, diazepam 367 ng/mL, nordiazepam 364 ng/mL,\ntemazepam 19 ng/mL, oxazepam 45 ng/mL, sertraline 31 ng/mL,\npregabalin 47.0 mg/L, risperidone 35 ng/mL and traces of benzoylecgonine (<10 ng/mL). Due to the unpreserved sample being\nexhausted, flualprazolam was only quantified in the fluoride oxalate\npreserved blood sample with a concentration of 3.1 ng/mL. All these\n\ndrugs were confirmed in urine. Death was attributed to mixed drug\ntoxicity.\nCase 7 was a 57-year-old male who was found lying on the\nfloor next to the bed, cold to the touch and not breathing. An\nambulance was called and attending paramedics confirmed death.\nHe had a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, chest infections, heart problems and drug use. It is reported\nhe would take cocaine and smoke or inject crack cocaine and heroin.\nFluoride oxalate and unpreserved femoral blood samples were\nprovided. The preserved blood sample contained cocaine 41 ng/mL,\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jat/article/45/4/410/5890364 by guest on 02 December 2022\n\nFluoride oxalate\npreserved blood\n\n\fQuantification of Flualprazolam in Blood by LC–MS-MS\n\nDiscussion\nHere we have presented a validated method to measure flualprazolam in nine cases following identification of this drug using\nLC–Q-TOF-MS screening. The method uses a small amount of\nsample (50 µL).\nThere is no published theoretical or evidential data for postmortem redistribution of flualprazolam, so interpretation should\nbe undertaken with caution. At present, there are no antemortem\ncases to compare postmortem cases with, although our case series\nhas 1 antemortem case (case 9) where the serum and citrate preserved blood sample concentrations of 4.89 and 8.52 ng/mL are at\nthe lower end of, but within, the range of the 8 postmortem cases\n(2.83–35.1 ng/mL).\nOur cases series range is very similar to those reported by Kriikku\net al. (14) of 4.2–68 ng/g. Similar to our findings, the contribution\nof flualprazolam is not well established as they report flualprazolam having been implicated in a case where the flualprazolam was\nonly 4.2 ng/g (4.2 mg/mL), but not in a case where it was 45 ng/g\n(45 ng/mL).\nIn all cases, several other sedative drugs were detected including\nheroin (as metabolites) and other benzodiazepines including etizolam and the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists 4F MDMBBINACA and MDMB-4en-PINACA. It has been proposed that\ndesigner benzodiazepines may be taken to counteract the negative\neffects of stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine, or to negate\nthe withdrawal symptoms from other drugs such as heroin and alcohol. Therefore, it is possible that the flualprazolam was taken either\nas a mixture of drugs or was present as a contaminant of other illicit\ncompounds such as heroin or etizolam. Flualprazolam and other\ndesigner benzodiazepines have been detected in tablets labelled as\nother benzodiazepines, for example, Xanax (alprazolam) (16). As it\nhas not been possible to quantify the contribution of each individual\ndrug, the Coroner’s judgment in all cases was that the death was\n\nlikely due to a mixed drug toxicity, primarily a mixed central nervous system depression, with no attempt to cull any drugs from\ncontributing.\nThere are two cases in our series where there is a significant difference in the results of samples that were obtained concurrently. The\nexplanation for these discrepancies is not clear. All samples were run\nwithin the validated method described. In case 9, the antemortem\nserum results of 4.89 ng/mL was almost half that of the citrate sample of 8.52 ng/mL. Although citrate is a preservative, it is possible\nthat if a tube had not been sufficiently filled, there may have been\na falsely low concentration due to a dilution effect, but both tubes\nwere adequately filled, and the citrate result is higher rather than\nlower than the serum result.\nIn case 4, flualprazolam was quantified in both a fluoride oxalate\nand unpreserved blood sample with the concentrations of 3.49\nand 14.1 ng/mL, respectively. In all the other cases, the preserved\nand unpreserved sample results were comparable. It is possible that\nthere is a high concentration of flualprazolam in the antemortem\nwhole blood compared to serum alone, but, although postmortem\nsamples are not ideal, a larger difference in fluoride oxalate preserved\nand unpreserved samples may have been expected in the postmortem\nsamples if this were the case.\nThe prevalence of flualprazolam is still very low (9 cases out\nof 2,911 reported between the first and last flualprazolam reported\nin an 8-month period), but it, along with other designer benzodiazepines, should be screened for in all postmortem cases as its\npotency may be a significant contributor to death. It is of note that\nfive of the nine cases are from the same geographical region that the\nprevious spate of synthetic fentanyl deaths was believed to originate\nfrom (17). This may suggest entry into the United Kingdom from\na sea port central to this area. It is also of note that the cases with\nflualprazolam were all detected between April and December 2019;\nnone have been detected up to April 2020 at our laboratory. This\nis classical of the NPS trends where NPS detection fluctuates (18).\nHowever, it is still imperative that flualprazolam is screened for as it\nis likely to reappear soon.\n\nReferences\n1.
