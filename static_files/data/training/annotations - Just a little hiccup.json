Description We describe the case of a 44-\r\nyear-old man with no comorbidities who underwent two uneventful general anaesthetics\r\n(GAs) in a 2-week interval: the first for cystourethroscopy and insertion of a ureteric\r\nstent and the second for stent removal. After the first surgery, the patient reported\r\nhiccups that commenced shortly after his procedure and persisted for 3 days before\r\nresolving spontaneously. On the second occasion, he experienced persistent hiccups\r\nfor 10 days despite early therapeutic management. Discussion Mechanisms of perioperative\r\nhiccups are not well known; however, persistent hiccups after two GA\r\nexposures suggest common precipitating factors. The incidence of hiccups with propofol\r\nis described as being < 1% [1]. At first, the patient received volatile maintenance\r\nanaesthesia after propofol induction, whereas on the second occasion, total intravenous\r\nanaesthesia was employed. We note that an increased total dose of propofol\r\nadministered was associated with an increased duration of hiccups, suggesting a dosedependent\r\nrather than an 'all or nothing' association. Subsequent 'propofol-free'\r\nanaesthesia may help to isolate propofol as a precipitant in this case. High-dose\r\ndexamethasone has been described as a trigger for hiccups, possibly via direct\r\nsimulation of the hiccup reflex arc. The literature describes a male preponderance, a\r\n75% recurrence rate on re-administration and a dose-dependent association seen with\r\na median dose of 10 mg [2]. This patient received 8 mg dexamethasone as anti-emetic\r\nprophylaxis on both occasions, which may have been an inciting factor. Use of a\r\nregional anaesthetic technique may theoretically help determine whether the surgical\r\nstimulus itself or administered medication was the precipitating factor. It should be noted\r\nhowever, that hiccups have also been described after spinal anaesthesia. This patient\r\nreceived oral chlorpromazine, commenced on the sixth postoperative day. There is\r\ncurrently no published data available describing the efficacy of pre-medication for\r\nprevention of hiccups. Given the paucity of data, we propose full discussion with such\r\npatients about potential causes and sequential exclusion of possible precipitants to yield\r\nan anaesthetic technique that eliminates this distressing side effect.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nanesthetic agent; antiemetic agent; chlorpromazine; dexamethasone; local\r\nanesthetic agent; propofol\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\nelective surgery; hiccup; postoperative complication\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nadult; adverse drug reaction; case report; clinical article; comorbidity; complication;\r\nconference abstract; cystoscopy; distress syndrome; drug megadose; drug therapy;\r\nhuman; incidence; intravenous anesthesia; male; prevention; prophylaxis;\r\nrecurrence risk; reflex arc; side effect; simulation; spinal anesthesia; surgery; ureter\r\nstent\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\nRecord downloaded - Fri 11 04 06:52:11 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nchlorpromazine (50-53-3, 69-09-0)\r\ndexamethasone (50-02-2)\r\npropofol (2078-54-8)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\nEnglish\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\nEnglish\r\nPUI\r\nL638956669\r\nDOI\r\n10.1111/anae.15766\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anae.15766\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L638956669&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nSuresh A, Kigozi M, Jain A.
