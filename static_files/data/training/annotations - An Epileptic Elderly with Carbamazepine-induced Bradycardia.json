An epileptic elderly with carbamazepine-induced bradycardia. Nihon Ronen Igakkai zasshi. Japanese journal of geriatrics. 2022;59(3):378-80. DOI: 10.3143/geriatrics.59.378.\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n  Carbamazepine (CBZ) is used for treatment of epileptic seizures and trigeminal neuralgia, but it is known that its adverse reactions on the cardiovascular system include sick sinus syndrome due to inhibitory effect on Na channel of conducting system of the heart1).\r\n  We report on our experience with an elderly case which developed bradycardia spells due to carbamazepine.\r\n\r\nCase presentation\r\n\r\n  The case is a 96-year-old female. Past medical history includes hypertension, dementia, and lumbar spinal stenosis, and she requires total assistance for activities of daily living. She started showing decreased consciousness level from evening on 2021 September X. Although she opened her eyes with name calling, she did not respond verbally. Her consciousness level did not improve on the following morning; hence, she was transported by an ambulance to our hospital on that day. She showed generalized convulsion for approximately one minute before she was transported. At the time of arrival at the hospital, blood pressure was 158/79 mmHg, heart rate was 104 bpm and regular, body weight was 48.8 kg, and BMI was 23.7 kg/m2. No abnormalities were observed in the heart, lungs, abdominal areas. Neurological findings include: consciousness level at Japan Coma Scale II-20, no conjugate deviation, bilateral pupil sizes at 3.0s mm with quick light reflex, normal tendon reflexes of extremities normal, and no signs of meningeal irritation such as Babinski sign or stiff neck. Biochemistry tests revealed nothing specific findings. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, heart rate 84 bpm, QT time 0.37 seconds, and no ST-T change (Fig. A). No abnormalities were observed on the chest X-ray. Head MRI showed no organic lesion that may become a focus of epilepsy. The patient was admitted due to convulsive seizure. The brain waves measured on Day 2 demonstrated high-amplitude slow waves and sharp waves mainly in the bilateral frontal regions (Fig. B). Consciousness disturbance was prolonged, and the patient was diagnosed with non-convulsive status epilepticus. When diazepam 5.0 mg was administered while measuring brain waves, high-amplitude slow waves and sharp waves disappeared. However, when the effect of diazepam diminished, the high-amplitude slow waves and sharp waves appeared again. The patient also showed respiratory depression due to diazepine; therefore, the patient underwent tracheal intubation and was placed under ventilator management, and then continuous administration of midazolam was started. In addition, CBZ 200 mg was started on Day 2 as an anti-epileptic drug. The brain waves measured during continuous administration of midazolam no longer showed \r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nAn epileptic elderly with carbamazepine-induced bradycardia\r\n1) Department of Neurology, Chikamori Health Care Group, Chikamori Hospital\r\n2) Department of General Internal Medicine, Chikamori Health Care Group Chikamori Hospital\r\nContact person: Daisuke Kuzume, Department of Neurology, Chikamori Health Care Group Chikamori Hospital (1-1-16 Okawasuji, Kochi-shi, Kochi 780-8522) \r\ne-mail: dkuzume@chikamori.com\r\nReceived on: 2022. 2. 16, Accepted on: 2022. 3. 24\r\ndoi:10.3143/geriatrics.59.378 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh-amplitude slow waves and sharp waves. After confirming this, the patient was extubated on Day 4. The patient became alert and communication with her was established. In addition general condition including hemodynamics became stable. However, in the evening of Day 5, frequent sinus bradycardia suddenly appeared on the monitor of electrocardiography of heart rate at 30 bpm (Fig. C). The biochemistry test revealed low albumin at 2.4 g/dL. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated no specific findings. A temporary pacemaker was placed for sinus bradycardia. Considering the cause of sinus bradycardia to be adverse reaction to CBZ, we measured blood concentration of CBZ, and then discontinued CBZ and switched to levetiracetam (LEV). Since then, pacemaker rhythm was not observed. After determining that sinus bradycardia was resolved, the temporary pacemaker was removed. The sinus bradycardia was not observed after the removal of the pacemaker. The blood concentration of CBZ was found at a later date to be 12.1 �g/mL (reference range: 4.0 to 12.0 �g/mL). The patient was transferred to another facility on Day 24.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\n  We considered that the sinus bradycardia was induced by CBZ based on the fact that the sinus bradycardia appeared after administration of CBZ and disappeared after discontinuation of CBZ. In addition, we believe that the reason for elevated CBZ concentration in the blood was that hypoalbuminemia caused an increase of free level of CBZ in the blood because CBZ has high protein binding ratio2).\r\n  Sasaki, et al. summarized the cases of CBZ-induced sinus bradycardia, such as our case, and sinus arrest, which demonstrated that the cases of sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest were common in older females3). Previous reports stated that: (1) older women tend to be affected with negative chronotropic effect and negative dromotropic effect, but these were reversible1); (2) older persons had atrophy or deficiency of sinoatrial node and sinoatrial nodal cells4); (3) there may not be dose dependence between blood concentration of CBZ and occurrence of cardiovascular adverse reactions5). According to this, we believe that the present case had the following pathological conditions which led to sinus bradycardia with CBZ: (1) she had latent sinus dysfunction due to old age; (2) hypoalbuminemia caused the elevation of CBZ blood concentration; (3) Na channel suppression effect, a pharmacological effect of CBZ, acted on the sinoatrial node inducing effects such as negative chronotropic effect and caused sinus bradycardia.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWe experienced an elderly case of bradycardia spells due to administration of CBZ.\r\n\r\n378\r\n    \thttps://www.jpn-geriat-soc.or.jp/\r\n379\r\nhttps://www.jpn-geriat-soc.or.jp/ \tAn epileptic elderly with carbamazepine-induced bradycardia\r\n380\r\n     Japanese Journal of Geriatrics Vol. 59 No. 3 (2022:7) \thttps://www.jpn-geriat-soc.or.jp/",{"entities":[[47,49,"REPORTERTITLE"],[50,57,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[58,64,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[66,84,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[86,95,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[97,113,"REPORTERSTREET"],[115,120,"REPORTERCITY"],[122,130,"REPORTERPOSTCODE"],[132,134,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[157,181,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[234,249,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[321,343,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[416,438,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[440,666,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1101,1112,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[1113,1120,"PATIENTSEX"],[1151,1163,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1165,1173,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1179,1201,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1207,1268,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1660,1698,"SERIOUSNESSHOSPITALIZATION"],[1784,1788,"PATIENTWEIGHT"],[1940,1945,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[2719,2753,"DRUGINDICATION"],[2759,2767,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2768,2771,"DRUGSTRUCTUREDOSAGENUMB"],[2772,2774,"DRUGSTRUCTUREDOSAGEUNIT"],[2904,2912,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"]]}]]}
