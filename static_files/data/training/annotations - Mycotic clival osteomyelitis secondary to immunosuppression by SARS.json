Usually, the microorganisms\ninvolved are Staphylococcus aureus, and the most prevalent mycotic agent is Aspergillosis\n\nis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 4.0 License, which allows others\nto remix, transform, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.\n©2022 Published by Scientific Scholar on behalf of Surgical Neurology International\n\nSurgical Neurology International • 2022 • 13(459)\n\n|\n\n1\n\n\fDelgado-Arce, et al.: Clival osteomyelitis and SARS-CoV-2\n\nfumigatus.[14] Within the still present COVID-19 pandemic, the\ncoexistence of SARS-CoV-2 and Mucormycosis (also known as\nblack fungus) has been reported, infecting nasal and orbital\nbone structures, occasionally with an extension to skull base\nbrain parenchyma.[8] We present the case of an Aspergillosis\ninfection with clival bone extension, within the context of a\npreviously treated COVID-19 infection.\n\nCLINICAL CASE PRESENTATION\nA 52-year-old female with a previous medical history of\nhypertension in adherence to antihypertensive treatment\n(thiazide and angiotensin II receptor blocker), type 2 diabetes\nin adherence to Glargine insulin, and metformin treatment,\narrived to the emergency room with ventilatory compromise\nand hypoxemia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed\nwith a positive PCR test, clinically classified as moderate\nCOVID-19 due to fever, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, which\nrequired 18 days of hospitalization and management with\nintravenous corticosteroids (6 mg dexamethasone q. d.) as\nwell as subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (60 mg\nenoxaparin q. d.). Hospital discharge was decided after\nstable and favorable clinical evolution, with prescription of\ncontinuous supplementary oxygen (5 L/h), dose adjustment\nof antidiabetic drugs, with no further required changes or\ncomplications.\nTwo weeks after hospital discharge, she presents a mild\nheadache (visual analog scale 4/10). A month after discharge,\nshe presents malaise and an unexplained weight loss of 8 kg.\nDuring follow-up, neurologic examination was unremarkable\nand there was no further need of supplementary oxygen.\nNevertheless, cephalgia and intermittent nasal constipation\nwere the patient’s prevalent symptoms.\nA head computed tomography (CT) scan was performed,\nwhich revealed a lesion within the paranasal sinuses. Bone\nwindow revealed demineralization with trabecular pattern,\nand cortical involvement of the walls of the ethmoid and\nsphenoid sinuses, pterygoid processes, turbinate bones,\nnasal septum, clivus, petrous apex, vomer, carotid foramina,\ngreater wings of the sphenoid bone, frontal processes, orbital\nprocesses of frontal bone, and anterior and posterior clinoid\nprocesses, [Figure 1].\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the skull base at the\nlevel of the clivus and the petrous apex showed soft tissues\nas isointense to muscle tissue in T1-weighted sequence and\nhyperintense in T2-weighted as well as in fluid-attenuated\ninversion recovery sequence, with gadolinium enhancement\nin fat-saturated contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1+C+FAT)\nsequence, [Figure 2]. Loss of fat planes among soft tissue was\nidentified with restriction in diffusion sequence, corroborated\nin apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequence map,\n[Figure 3].\nSurgical Neurology International • 2022 • 13(459)\n\n|\n\n2\n\nGiven the MRI findings, surgical excision through navigationguided transnasal transclival endoscopic extended approach\nand later nasoseptal pediculated flap rotation was performed,\n[Figure 4]. Transoperative findings showed sphenoidal\nrostrum lysis with extension to lateral recesses, clival, and\nsella turcica osteolysis, with no dural invasion. Surgical\ndebridement was performed in a conventional manner, with\nno apparent complications. The patient was discharged 48 h\npostsurgery, with no clinical signs of transnasal fistula.\nMicrobiology and histopathological analysis revealed 90°\nangled hyphae suspicious of Aspergillosis, [Figure 5]. A culture\nconfirmation of the fungus was realized, with positive results\nto Aspergillus spp. Hospital readmission was suggested\nfor antimicrobial treatment; intravenous fluconazole and\nliposomal amphotericin B treatment were prescribed for\n30 days, which concluded with no further complications.\n\nDISCUSSION\nSBO is a rare entity with high risk of mortality, representing\nboth a clinical and imaging diagnostic challenge. There are\ntwo categories of skull base osteomyelitis: typical and atypical\n(or central) osteomyelitis.[6]\nTypical SBO is the most frequent type among these two. Most\ntypical SBO cases present within diabetic and elder population,\nwhose immunocompromise leads to external necrotizing otitis\nby Pseudomonas infection.[5] Atypical or central SBO invades\nthe sphenoidal and occipital bones, with nonrelated previous\notic infection.[11] S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are\nsome of the most frequently reported bacterial pathogens in\natypical SBO. Likewise, A. fumigatus is the mycotic pathogen\nmost frequently reported in the literature.[14] The known\nmechanism of skull base invasion by these microorganisms is\nthrough contiguous translocation through Santorini fissures\nand hematologic translocation through the venous plexus\nlocated within the temporal bone.[18] An established anatomical\nrisk factor for clival osteomyelitis is a prominent navicular fossa,\nwhich is a known anatomical variant of clival morphology.[15]\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical severity has\nbeen graded as asymptomatic, symptomatic, ventilatory\ncompromise, severe ventilatory failure, and death. Within\nthe context of COVID-19, bacterial and mycotic secondary\ninfections are a clinical challenge due to its abrupt increase\nof morbidity and mortality.[19] Candidiasis and Aspergillosis\nwere the most commonly reported fungi pathogens\ncorrelated to COVID-19 infection during the pandemic.[9] In\naddition, it has been also demonstrated that corticosteroids\nare an effective treatment as immune response modulators,\nresulting in a decrease in mortality in severe COVID-19\ninfection.[17] Nevertheless, the overuse of corticosteroids also\nconveys a higher risk of secondary opportunistic coinfections\nthat may risk patient’s survival.[13]\n\n\fDelgado-Arce, et al.: Clival osteomyelitis and SARS-CoV-2\n\nFigure 1: Axial computed tomography scan, bone window with osteomyelitis extension within the\noccipital bone base and the sphenoidal sinus.\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFigure 2: Axial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating a hypointense lesion with sphenoid boy\nand clival bone involvement (a) infiltrating nasopharyngeal submucous tissue (b) with a hypointense\nappearance in T1 and T2 sequences. Gadolinium enhancement in T1 of sphenoid and clival bone tissue.\n\nto the ambiguous signs and symptoms that may be present,\ndifficulties to reach a diagnosis are common, as well as the\nmisdiagnosis of malignant skull base tumors in different\nimaging studies.\nRadio imaging correlation with the clinical presentation\nis fundamental during the diagnosis approach of SBO. In\ngeneral, the use of contrasted CT scan and gadoliniumenhanced MRI is fundamental. In complex cases, the use of\nfunctional studies may provide us useful bone metabolism\ndata, such as positron emission tomography CT scan with\ntechnetium 99.[6]\n\nFigure 3: Axial diffusion-weighted imaging with focal\nfluid along the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus\npersisting hyperintensity, suggesting focal abscess.\n\nWhen atypical SBO is present, it is important to evaluate key\nareas including the bony external auditory canal, mastoid\nprocess, temporomandibular joint, petrous apex, petrooccipital fissure, foramen lacerum, jugular foramen, and\nclivus, where most frequently the origin of disease is clival\ninfection.[1,6,16]\n\nCephalgia and facial pain are symptoms reported in most\nSBO cases. However, several cases with cranial nerves\naffection (VI, IX, X, XI, and XII) have been reported.[16] Due\n\nCT scan is the gold standard imaging study for SBO. It is a\nhelpful tool to evaluate the extent and severity of infection,\nas well as to assess cortical bone erosion or trabecular\ndemineralization related to osteomyelitis.[6,11,16] There is\nSurgical Neurology International • 2022 • 13(459)\n\n|\n\n3\n\n\fDelgado-Arce, et al.: Clival osteomyelitis and SARS-CoV-2\n\nFigure 4: Navigation-guided transnasal transclival endoscopic extended approach with clival drilling.\n\nfat plane obliteration. When osteomyelitis affects the\nbone marrow, there is loss of normal fat signal within the\nbone marrow space. Infiltration may precede edema and\nphlegmon, which are evidenced as hyperintensity in T2\nsequence and heterogeneous enhancement in T1-weighted\nfat-saturated and contrast-enhanced sequences.[6,11] In severe\nosteomyelitis, bone marrow may progress from necrotic\ntissue into an abscess, producing a ring-enhanced lesion.[6]\nDiffusion restriction in nonenhanced fluid collections can\nhelp confirm an abscess. In addition, ADC sequence may\nallow distinction between SBO and neoplastic lesions.[6]\n\nFigure 5: Microphotography of histopathological\nbone tissue sample with hematoxylin and eosin\nstaining. Numerous angled hyphae of Aspergillus\nspp. are identified (yellow arrow).\n\noften evidence of invasive sinusitis with cortical erosions of\nthe paranasal sinuses, particularly the sphenoid or ethmoid\nsinuses, anterior clivus, and foramina of the central skull\nbase.[6,16] Contrast-enhanced CT scan can be of additional\nbenefit for the evaluation of vascular complications, including\ncavernous sinus thrombosis or stroke.[6]\nMRI is complementary for soft-tissue analysis around\nthe skull base and medullary cavity of the bone.[6,11] On\nT1-weighted sequence, the ill-defined soft issue demonstrates\neither hypo- or isointense signal of the muscle, causing\nSurgical Neurology International • 2022 • 13(459)\n\n|\n\n4\n\nNuclear medicine provides both functional and metabolic\ndata of the osseous tissue, complementing for localization\nof skull base infection. Specifically, technetium 99m-methyl\ndiphosphonate (Tc99m MDP) demonstrates a higher\nosteoblastic activity whenever an infectious process is present\nwithin the bone.[2]\nSurgical debridement and antimycotic treatment are the\nstandard therapy on invasive SBO caused by Aspergillosis.[3] The\nmain objective of surgical treatment is to perform a safe and\nmaximum debridement with posterior long-term antimycotic\ntreatment.[4] In the previous decades, liposomal amphotericin B\nused to be the treatment of choice for invasive Aspergillosis.[7]\nVoriconazole, a second-generation triazole, has demonstrated\na greater efficacy as treatment proposed for Aspergillosis. The\nprevious studies have demonstrated an effective soft tissue\nand bone distribution of voriconazole, which is convenient\ndue to bone, meningeal, and central nervous system damage\nheld by invasive Aspergillosis infection.[3]\n\n\fDelgado-Arce, et al.: Clival osteomyelitis and SARS-CoV-2\n\nCONCLUSION\nClival osteomyelitis secondary to mycotic infection is a rare\nclinical infectious entity with a challenging diagnosis and\ntreatment approach. It is usually considered an exclusion\ndiagnosis and is finally confirmed with histopathological and\nmicrobiological analysis. Within the still present COVID-19\npandemic, we encourage a high suspicion of this entity\nto be considered in elder, diabetic patients treated with\ncorticosteroids, with atypical signs and symptoms. Surgical\ndebridement is not only vital part of the treatment but also\npart of the definite diagnosis approach.\nAcknowledg ments\n\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\n9.\n\nTranslated by Rodrigo Uribe and Jafet García.\nDeclaration of patient consent\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate\npatient consent.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\n\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\n15.\n16.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nAbou-Al-Shaar H, Mulvaney GG, Alzhrani G, Gozal YM,\nOakley GM, Couldwell WT.
