While UV exposure is a\npredominant risk factor for KA, koebnerization or\ntrauma-induced KAs have been reported after surgical procedures, laser therapy, and cryotherapy.1\n5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream is frequently used to\ntreat actinic field damage in patients. We describe a\ncase of 5-FU cream-induced formation of numerous\nKAs.\n\nCASE REPORT\nA man in his 60s with a history of eruptive and\nreactive KAs and squamous cell carcinoma after\ntrauma presented with a 2-week history of painful,\npruritic, and enlarging nodules on his left arm during\nthe use of 5% 5-FU cream to treat multiple actinic\nkeratoses on both forearms. He began to develop the\nlesions 2 weeks into a 4-week course, which he\ncompleted. Of note, he had a history of both\nspontaneous KAs and KA-like squamous cell carcinomas as well as trauma-induced (after excision and\ninjury) lesions on his upper and lower extremities for\nthe preceding 5 years. Physical examination revealed\nmultiple, tender, hyperkeratotic, and erythematous\ncrateriform nodules with central ulceration on the\nleft forearm at the sites of 5-FU application for actinic\nkeratoses (Fig 1). Biopsy findings were consistent\nwith KA. While he did have a history of eruptive KAs\n(between 10 and 15 lesions), he had never developed so many large, painful lesions over such a short\nperiod of time. There are multiple reports of eruptive\nKA being associated with internal malignancy.

Of note, he had used\n5-FU cream on his face before and did not have a\nsimilar reaction.\nBecause of the clinical and histopathologic features, the patient was diagnosed with eruptive KAs\nsecondary to topical 5-FU application for the treatment of actinic keratoses. He was treated with\nacitretin 10 mg daily in addition to serial shave\nexcisions followed by intralesional 5-FU, which\nwas well tolerated and led to a decrease in pruritus.\nOne month after initiating therapy, there was a\ndecrease in the size and number of lesions, resulting\nin an overall improvement in skin disease (Fig 2).\n\nDISCUSSION\nKAs are cutaneous lesions that typically present as\ncrateriform nodules that may regress spontaneously.\nSolitary lesions are most common, but when there\nare multiple, these have been associated with rare\ngenetic or sporadic syndromes such as xeroderma\npigmentosum, Muir-Torre syndrome, FergusonSmith syndrome, and Grzybowski syndrome, also\nknown as generalized eruptive KA of Grzybowski.1,2\nEruptive and reactive KAs have been reported\nto occur in the context of several provoking\nfactors such as immunosuppressive medications,\nJAAD Case Reports 2021;16:19-21.\n2352-5126\nÓ 2021 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.
