The patient 78 years was admitted with a tentative diagnosis of varicella zoster viral\r\nmeningitis. A pharmacist suspected ACV encephalopathy related to excessive VACV administration and raised a query\r\nwith the attending physician. According to the pharmacist's proposal, ACV administration was discontinued and continuous\r\nhemodiaˆltration (CHDF) was performed. On day 5 of hospitalisation, the consciousness disorder was improved.\r\nIn this report, we showed the detailed CHDF conditions of the present case, and the contribution of a pharmacist\r\nto treating and avoiding ACV encephalopathy was discussed.\r\nKey words―acyclovir encephalopathy; pharmacist; adverse eŠect\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nValacyclovir hydrochloride (VACV) is a renal-excretion-\r\ntype drug.1) It may induce adverse reactions\r\nsuch as neuropsychiatric disorders and convulsion in\r\npatients with renal failure. In patients with renal\r\nhypofunction, accumulation of acyclovir (ACV) and\r\nits metabolite, 9-carboxymethoxymethylguanine\r\n(CMMG), during VACV administration can lead to\r\nthe development of adverse neuropsychiatric reactions\r\nand dose reductions are needed. VACV is a\r\nprodrug to which L-valine is added to improve the\r\noral absorbability of ACV. After being absorbed,\r\nVACV is hydrolysed to ACV. The digestive tract absorption\r\nrate of this drug is three to ˆve times higher\r\nthan that of ACV, and the area under the curve is approximately\r\nˆve-fold.2) Therefore, the frequency of\r\nVACV dosing is lower than that oral ACV dosing;\r\nmaking this drug easy to use. However, its blood concentration\r\nis often high, and the risk of adverse events\r\nis increased in patients with renal dysfunction, and\r\nthose in older age-groups or with low bodyweight.24)\r\nCentral nervous system symptoms such as consciousness\r\ndisorder and articulation disturbance, characteristic\r\nof the adverse event ACV encephalopathy,\r\nresemble those of varicella zoster virus meningitis.58)\r\nCareful selection of diagnostic and treatment strategies\r\nis therefore important. We retrospectively examined\r\nthis case from the viewpoint of the contribution\r\nof pharmacists in the management of ACV\r\nencephalopathy.917)\r\nCASE SUMMARY\r\nPatient Background The case describes a 78-\r\nyear-old male with bodyweight 48 kg. Exanthema was\r\nnoted the day before admission and he consulted a local\r\nclinic. VACV was prescribed under a diagnosis of\r\nherpes zoster. On the same day hallucinations appeared.\r\nNausea and vomiting occurred from 1:00 am\r\nthe following day and he was brought to our hospital\r\nby ambulance (day 1 of onset).\r\nPhysical Examination on Admission and Laboratory\r\nData The patient who presented with a major\r\ncomplaint of consciousness disorder, nausea/vomiting.\r\nHis medical history included cerebral infarction,\r\nrenal failure, hypertension, 3-year history of dialysis\r\n(Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday), with no previous\r\nadverse reactions. His medications included\r\ncilostazol, esomeprazole magnesium hydrate, irbesartan/\r\namlodipine besilate combination tablets, lanthanum\r\ncarbonate, and VACV.\r\nClinical Follow-up after Admission On admis772\r\nTable 1.

After admission, intravenous ACV was initiated,\r\nand the emergency physician inquired about\r\nthe dosage of ACV. The pharmacist scrutinized the\r\npatient information. The dose of VACV before admission\r\nwas unclear. Furthermore, haemodialysis was\r\noriginally scheduled on the day of admission, but was\r\nnot possible. It was conˆrmed that haemodialysis was\r\nto be performed on day 3 of hospitalisation (2 d\r\nlater). In addition, an intravenous drip of ACV at\r\n250 mg (5.2 mg/kg/session) was administered once\r\nimmediately after admission.\r\nCorrespondence with the Physician by the Pharmacist\r\nThe pharmacist focused on the possibility\r\nthat the symptoms were related to ACV encephalopathy\r\nbecause the patient received dialysis\r\nand because the dosage of VACV tablets administered\r\nbefore admission was unclear. The continuation\r\nof the intravenous drip of ACV at 5 mg/kg\r\nper 24 h in a state in which haemodialysis is impossible\r\nin the presence of ACV encephalopathy may exacerbate\r\nthe condition; therefore, a prescription\r\nquery was raised. In addition, the pharmacist requested\r\nthat the physician conˆrm the dosage of VACV before\r\nadmission. It was revealed that VACV 1000 mg\r\nwas administered every 8 h before admission and that\r\nthe patient had taken a total of 2000 mg of VACV.\r\nThe pharmacist provided information to the emergency\r\nphysician: there is a case report on ACV removal\r\nby continuous hemodiaˆltration (CHDF).9) After\r\nconsultation, ACV administration was discontinued,\r\nCHDF was performed the following day (day 2 of\r\nhospitalisation), and the patient's conscious state was\r\nmonitored. Furthermore, the possibility of concomitant\r\nVZV meningitis was unable to be excluded,\r\nand a strategy to resume ACV administration after\r\nthe reduction of the consciousness disorder was\r\nadopted.\r\nClinical Course after Correspondence Based on\r\na viral test (VZV-DNA) conducted on day 3 of\r\nhospitalisation, the possibility of VZV meningitis was\r\nexcluded. Furthermore, the sites of herpes zoster involving\r\nthe left anterior thoracic/dorsal regions\r\nbecame crusted, and pain or pruritus was conˆrmed\r\nto be `mild' to `no sign'. CHDF, which was started on\r\nday 2 of hospitalisation, was continued for 3 d (performed\r\ntotal of 39 h). The ‰ow rate of dialysis ‰uid\r\nwas 0.66 L/h. Regarding the type of ˆlter, polyether\r\nsulfone and polymethyl methacrylate ˆlters with a\r\nlarge membrane area were used (Table 2). On day 5\r\nof hospitalisation, the mean Glasgow Coma Scale\r\nGCS score exceeded 14 and there was no disorientation,\r\nwith favourable communication. On day 6 of\r\nhospitalisation, the dialysis method was switched to\r\nhaemodialysis. Amenamevir tablets, an anti-herpeszoster\r\ndrug metabolised in the liver, at 400 mg/d were\r\nprescribed on day 8 of hospitalisation and the patient\r\nwas discharged. There was no recurrence after the\r\nsymptoms subsided (Fig. 1).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn this case, oral administration at 2000 mg (fourfold\r\nthe dose of VACV recommended for patients\r\nwith renal hypofunction) on the middle day of haemodialysis\r\nmay have led to ACV overdose. Since the\r\nincreases in the serum levels of ACV and CMMG are\r\nconsidered to be involved in the onset of ACV encephalopathy,\r\nthe dosage of ACV should be adjusted\r\nto be a maximum blood concentration of ＜10 mg/\r\nmL for haemodialysis patients.2) The maximum\r\nblood concentrations of ACV after single-dose oral\r\nadministration of VACV 1000 mg to healthy adults\r\nand dialysis patients are 5.84 and 10.6 mg/mL, respec773\r\nTable 2.

In the present case, the dosage of VACV was\r\nfour-fold higher than the recommended dosage in accordance\r\nwith renal function, suggesting that blood\r\nconcentration of ACV exceeded the threshold for the\r\nonset of ACV encephalopathy. In addition, the onset\r\nof ACV encephalopathy at the ˆrst to the third day of\r\nACV administration was reported in HD patients,\r\neven if ACV dose was equal to the recommended dose\r\nfor HD patients.1012) The cause was suggested to be\r\nindividual diŠerences in pharmacokinetics due to\r\ngene polymorphisms in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2,\r\nwhich is involved in the metabolic process from ACV\r\nto CMMG.13) In the present case, the day of admission\r\nwas the date on which haemodialysis was scheduled,\r\nbut it was not possible. As an alternative,\r\nCHDF was conducted. The t1/2 is considered to be\r\n1.7 h when the reported pharmacokinetic parameters\r\nwere applied to this case.14) Based on previously\r\nreported cases,15) when we assumed that the maximum\r\nACV blood concentration of this case was\r\n10 mg/mL, it was considered that CHDF should be\r\nperformed for 5 h or more to reduce the blood concentration\r\nto less than 2 mg/mL, the reported minimum\r\nconcentration for the onset of ACV\r\nencephalopathy.16) Since the accumulated CMMG\r\nleads to the occurrence of side eŠects of the neuropsychiatric\r\nsystem,17) further veriˆcation of CHDF condition\r\nto improve ACV encephalopathy is needed. In\r\nthe present case, the symptoms involved in ACV encephalopathy\r\nwere improved after total 39 h of\r\nCHDF, suggesting that CHDF was eŠective for treating\r\nACV encephalopathy. Polyether sulfone and\r\nPMMA was used as the CHDF membrane in this case\r\n(Table 2). Although the detailed mechanism of the\r\nadsorption phenomenon by the membrane is\r\nunknown, some drug adsorption has been reported\r\non the PMMA membrane,14) suggesting e‹cacy in\r\nACV removal. To conˆrm this possibility, whether\r\n774 YAKUGAKU ZASSHI Vol. 142, No. 7 (2022)\r\nACV adsorb to PMMA membrane should be examined\r\nin the future study. To avoid ACV encephalopathy,\r\nthe pharmacist should collect information\r\nsuch as previous case reports, selection of drugs,\r\nand administration regimen for patients with renal\r\nhypofunction prioritized from the viewpoint of e‹cacy\r\nand safety, which should be shared with regional\r\npharmacies.9) Furthermore, pharmacists should be\r\nactive in the management of ACV encephalopathy.\r\nCon‰ict of Interest The authors declare no con-\r\n‰icts of interest.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1) Gunness P., Aleksa K., Bend J., Koren G.,\r\nTransl.
