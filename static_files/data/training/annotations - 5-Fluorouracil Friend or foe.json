She had been applying the cream \r\ntwice daily to her face, chest, arms and \r\nlegs for four weeks. The 5-FU cream \r\nhad been prescribed for the treatment of \r\nactinic keratosis. The prescribing doctor \r\nhad been unable to review the patient due \r\nto the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nQUESTION 1\r\nWhat is actinic keratosis?\r\nANSWER 1\r\nActinic keratoses, also known as solar \r\nkeratoses, are keratotic or scaling macules, \r\npapules or plaques resulting from the \r\nintraepidermal proliferation of atypical \r\nkeratinocytes in response to prolonged \r\nexposure to ultraviolet radiation.1 They \r\nmost commonly occur in older Caucasian \r\npopulations with extensive photodamage. \r\nIt is estimated that approximately one \r\nin 1000 actinic keratoses progresses \r\nto squamous cell carcinoma per \r\nyear, although this may be higher in \r\nimmunosuppressed patients.2\r\nCASE CONTINUED\r\nThe patient had diffuse erythema over the \r\nentire face, with a thick, adherent crust \r\n(Figure 1). The anterior chest showed \r\nscattered, discrete, superficially eroded \r\npapules. The skin was swabbed for \r\npathogens, and the patient commenced a \r\ncourse of cefalexin and valaciclovir. The \r\nswabs revealed no pathogens. To remove \r\nthe crust, the patient was treated with \r\nsaline-soaked cloth compresses to the \r\naffected areas twice daily for 30 minutes. \r\nMethylprednisolone aceponate fatty \r\nointment, a moderate-strength steroid, \r\nwas applied to the face, as it is less \r\nlikely to induce steroid side effects, \r\nsuch as atrophy and perioral dermatitis. \r\nBetamethasone dipropionate ointment, \r\na stronger steroid, was applied to the body \r\nat night. A weaker steroid, such as 1% \r\nhydrocortisone ointment, would not have \r\nbeen therapeutic. Emulsifying ointment \r\nwas applied regularly. As the adherent \r\ncrust loosened, it was gently debrided. \r\nAs the patient’s vision was affected, \r\nophthalmology review was organised. No \r\nabnormalities were detected. As a result \r\nof the complexity of the topical treatment, \r\nshe was admitted to hospital.\r\nQUESTION 2\r\nHow could this reaction have been \r\navoided?\r\nQUESTION 3\r\nWhy is this not an allergic reaction, and \r\nwhat is the prognosis of this severe adverse \r\nreaction?\r\nANSWER 2\r\nPatients should be given clear instructions \r\non the usage of 5-FU, the expected \r\nprogress and adverse events. Regardless \r\nof how confident a first-time patient may \r\nbe using 5-FU, they should be followed \r\nup (usually around the two-week mark) \r\nto monitor for any adverse events.3 The \r\ntreatment area should be limited to \r\n500 cm2 (23 cm × 23 cm), roughly the size \r\nof the face.4 A three-week regimen only is \r\nrecommended for facial skin.\r\nPatients should be advised to practice \r\nstrict sun protection and not use other \r\ntopicals concurrently. However, bland \r\nemollients may be applied 20 minutes \r\nafter the application of 5-FU.5\r\nExpected progress is the development \r\nof an inflammatory skin reaction on the \r\napplied areas, usually after 5–7 days. \r\nPatients should be advised that this is a \r\nnatural progression and not an allergic \r\n5-Fluorouracil: Friend or foe?\r\nFigure 1.

With ongoing application, the \r\nskin may become painful and red; if \r\ncontinued, this can result in crusting, \r\nerosion/ulceration and necrosis.\r\nOther acute complications, although \r\nuncommon, include secondary \r\ninfections.3 Chronic adverse events are \r\nalso uncommon, but include persistent \r\nerythema, dyspigmentation and failure \r\nof treatment.4\r\nOther regimens and treatments that can \r\nbe employed to minimise side effects in \r\nthis patient include:\r\n• small areas sequentially (eg just the \r\nforehead first and then the cheeks, \r\nor even smaller areas)\r\n• two days on, then five days off for \r\n9–12 weeks2\r\n• the four-day regimen combined \r\nwith calcipotriol3\r\n• pretreatment with daylight \r\nphotodynamic therapy.1\r\nThis patient had a severe inflammatory \r\nresponse, causing crusting on her \r\nface, chest, arms and legs as a result \r\nof continuous, extensive application \r\nwithout monitoring.\r\nANSWER 3\r\nAllergic reactions to 5-FU cream are \r\nuncommon. During an allergic reaction, \r\nall areas of skin exposed to 5-FU cream \r\nwill become confluently inflamed, and \r\nthis typically occurs earlier than severe \r\ninflammatory responses.6 As evident in \r\nthis patient, the reaction on the chest \r\nshows discrete lesions separated by \r\nintervening normal skin.\r\nThe prognosis for this severe \r\ninflammatory reaction is excellent, \r\nwith no expected sequelae. \r\nCASE CONTINUED\r\nFigure 2 shows the patient on the third \r\nday of treatment. She was then discharged \r\nfrom hospital. At the one-month review, \r\nthe patient had no crusting and only some \r\nresidual mild erythema on the face, upper \r\nlimbs and thighs.\r\nQUESTION 4\r\nWhat is 5-FU, and what are its advantages \r\nand disadvantages for the treatment of \r\nactinic keratosis?\r\nQUESTION 5\r\nWhat are the other treatment options for \r\nactinic keratosis?\r\nANSWER 4\r\nFive per cent 5-FU is a commonly used for \r\nthe treatment of actinic keratosis.2 It is also \r\nused for the treatment of intraepidermal \r\ncarcinoma.3 5-FU is a cytotoxic agent \r\nthat blocks the action of thymidylate \r\nsynthetase, therefore interfering with \r\nDNA synthesis.3 It is currently approved \r\nby the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme \r\nfor the indication of actinic keratosis.7 Its \r\nadvantages and disadvantages are listed \r\nin Table 1.\r\nANSWER 5\r\nOther treatments for actinic keratosis are \r\nlisted in Table 2.\r\nKey points\r\n• 5-FU is a common treatment in \r\nAustralia for actinic keratosis.\r\n• The patient must understand how to \r\nproperly use 5-FU and what to expect \r\nwith the peak reaction.\r\n• It is important to review the patient \r\nafter starting (approximately at the \r\ntwo-week mark) to manage their \r\n5-FU cream reaction.
