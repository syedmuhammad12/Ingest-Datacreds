The patient\nwas treated with Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days\n1, 2, 3, 4, Etoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3,\n4, Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion on days 2, 4, 6, and Mitoxantrone 10\nmg/m2 as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1, 2, 3. During treatment, the patient\nsuffered from 3 life-threatening complications caused by chemotherapy drugs include\nsinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), refractory thrombocytopenia, and pericardial\neffusion with pericardiocentesis limitation. To this end, we tried three novel approaches\nfor patient management by Corticosteroid and Colchicine. Intravenous immunoglobulin\ninfusion and oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective in thrombocytopenia.\nHowever, eltrombopag (25 mg/kg/d) response was dramatic. Moreover, pericardial\neffusion and respiratory distress during the first chemotherapy course were managed\nwith Lasix (2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d); meanwhile, the massive\npericardial effusion during the second chemotherapy course was managed with\nColchicine (0.5 mg/d) through the mentioned treatment. Fortunately, these approaches\nwere effective and life-saving.\nKeywords: Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, Pericardial\neffusion\n\npatientepisodename - Respiratory distress, Pulmonary hypertension, Pericardial effusion, Gene mutation, Hospitalisation, Acute myelomonocytic leukemia\npatientdrugindication- Pulmonary hypertension\nreactionmeddrallt - Pericardial effusion, Thrombocytopenia, Respiratory distress\ntestname- Bilirubin, Prothrombin time, Blood smear test, Neutrophils, Platelet count, Fibrinogen, Pulmonary arterial pressure, Hepatic enzyme, Echocardiography, Unevaluable investigation, Coagulation test, Creatinine, Bone marrow aspiration, Fibrin D dimer, Serum LDH, Bone marrow biopsy, Band neutrophil percentage, Lymphocytes, Cytogenetic analysis, Eosinophils, Uric acid, Activated partial thromboplastin time, \nactivesubstancename - CYTARABINE, HYDROCORTISONE, METHOTREXATE, IDARUBICIN, THIOGUANINE, ETOPOSIDE\ndrugindication - Acute myelomonocytic leukemia\ndrugreactionasses - Thrombocytopenia\n\n♦Corresponding Author:\nDr. Mozhgan Hashemieh, MD\nDepartment of Pediatrics\nHematology/Oncology, Shahid\nBeheshti University of Medical\nSciences, Tehran, Iran\nEmail:mozhgan.hashemieh@yahoo.com\n\nIntroduction\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML)\nis the second most prevalent disease\nin pediatric acute leukemia.1 In the\nUnited States and Europe, the\nincidence has been stable with three\nto five cases per 100,000 individuals.\nReceived: September 08, 2020; Accepted: March 08, 2022\n\nAML is treated via a highly potent\nchemotherapy regimen with severe\ncomplications. Its treatment\ncomplications could affect the main\norgans, including bone marrow, heart,\nliver, and kidney. The limitation of\naccess to new drugs, in other words,\n\n\fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.\n\ntheir unavailability in low- or middle-income\ncountries, is known to be a challenge for pediatric\noncologists.2\nCritical conditions, such as sinusoidal\nobstructive syndrome, steatosis, and pseudocirrhosis, are more commonly associated with\nchemotherapy. It is important to anticipate and\nrecognize these adverse effects so that appropriate\nclinical measures could be taken. Patients with\nthese liver manifestations can be normally\nmanaged with supportive therapies and\nDefibrotide. Liver toxicity may also be resolved\nafter discontinuation of chemotherapy. 3\nDefibrotide is unavailable in Iran.\nRefractory thrombocytopenia limits many\ninvasive procedures in oncologic patients, such\nas surgical operation or biopsy and other\ntherapeutic or diagnostic actions. In this article,\nwe solved three challenges of treatment employing\nnew alternative treatment options.\n\nCase Presentation\nOur subject was a four year-old male patient\nfrom Iran presenting pancytopenia, who was\nadmitted to Shahid Madani hospital (Khoramabad\nin Lorestan province/Iran). There was no history\nof any hematological disorders. On examination,\nthe patient had pallor and mild splenic\nenlargement, measuring 1.5 cm on the left below\n\nthe costal margin.\nLymphadenopathy or any abnormal physical\nfindings were unremarkable. The patient had been\nsuffering from prolonged fever and nocturnal\nsweats along with weakness and fatigue.\nMorphology and immunophenotyping peripheral\nblood cells were examined with an automated\nhematologic analyzer (Sysmex, XE-5000, Vienna,\nAustria).\nPeripheral blood smear examination showed\nnormocytic normochromic red blood cells,\nincluding a few nucleated red blood cells. White\nblood cells showed shift to the left with a\nsignificant number of myeloid blast cells. Several\ngiant platelets and platelet aggregates were seen.\nThe leukocyte differential count was eosinophils\n3%, lymphocytes 70%, and neutrophils 27%, and\nband forms 1%. Coagulation tests indicated a\nprolonged prothrombin time of 16.3 sec (reference\nrange, 10.2 to 13.8), a normal activated partial\nThromboplastin time, normal fibrinogen, and an\nincreased D-dimer concentration of 4.96 mg/mL\n(reference range, 0 to 0.35). Bone marrow smears\nwere stained with Wright-Giemsa and analyzed\naccording to the routine clinical laboratory\nprocedures. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy\nshowed an increased abnormal megakaryocytic.\nMonolobated and multinucleated megakaryocytic\nwith hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei were\n\nFigure 1. Left side shows myeloblast in peripheral blood in Wright-Giemsa staining (× 100) and right side (× 10).\n\n557\n\nMiddle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563\n\n\fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nalso seen, which showed that the myeloblast cells\n(Figure 1) were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34,\nCD14, CD71, CD117, MPO, HLA-DR, CD3,\nCD15, CD235a, and human leukocyte antigenDR. The biochemical parameters, namely uric\nacid, bilirubin, creatinine, and liver enzymes,\nwere normal. Serum LDH was highly increased.\nThe diagnosis was confirmed as AML-M4.\nCytogenetic study of bone marrow myeloblasts\nshowed t (8,21).\nThe patient was critically ill due to a high\npulmonary pressure and respiratory distress. First\nechocardiography showed a high pulmonary\npressure and a small amount of pericardial\neffusion. Lasix and Sildenafil were started for\nthe patient.\nBased on this diagnosis and concerning the\npatient’s severely compromised overall condition,\nwe started the therapy with Dutch-Belgian\npediatric AML protocol for children with newly\ndiagnosed AML:\nFirst course: Ara-C Idarubicin Etoposide\nThioguanin (AIET) induction\n6-Thioguanin 100 mg/m2 orally every 12 hours\non days 1, 2, 3, 4.\nCytarabine 200 mg/m2 per day with continuous\nIV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4;\nEtoposide 100 mg/m2 per day with continuous\nIV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4;\nIdarubicin 12 mg/m2 as a 4-hour IV infusion\non days 2, 4, 6;\n\nTriple intrathecal with Ara-C and MTX and\nHydrocortisone was injected based on ageadjusted instruction. Age-adjusted dose; see table\ntriple IT doses in the paragraph.\nSecond course: Ara-C Mitoxantrone (AM)\ninduction\nCytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day as continuous\nIV infusion on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;\nMitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 as a 30-minute IV\ninfusion on days 1, 2, 3;\nTriple intrathecal injection similar to the first\ninduction course. Age-adjusted dose; see table\ntriple IT doses in the paragraph.\nConsolidation therapy\nCytarabine 2 g/m2 every 12 hours as a 2-hour\nIV infusion on days 1, 2, 3 (a total of six doses);\nEtoposide 100 mg/m 2 as a 60-minute IV\ninfusion on days 2, 3, 4, 5;\nTriple intrathecal injection similar to the first\nand second induction courses. Age-adjusted dose;\nsee table triple IT doses in the paragraph.\nFollowing the first chemotherapy course, the\npatient was involved in refractory thrombocytopenia. Frequent infusion of the random donor\nor single donor apheresis platelets were done,\nbut platelet count was sometimes greater than\n20000. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion and\noral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/d) were not effective.\nAfter the second chemotherapy course, we treated\nhim with eltrombopag (EP) (25 mg/kg/d).\nFurthermore, following the initiation of\n\nFigure 2. Left side shows cardiomegaly due to pericardial effusion and right side shows decreasing effusion after prednisolone and\nColchicine.\n\nMiddle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563\n\n558\n\n\fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.\n\nchemotherapy, in every course, the patient was\ninvolved in pericardial effusion. Pericardial\neffusion and respiratory distress during the first\nchemotherapy course were managed via Lasix\n(2 mg/kg/d) and Spironolactone (25 mg/d).\nNevertheless, massive pericardial effusion during\nthe second chemotherapy course was managed\nusing Colchicine (0.5 mg/d) with the mentioned\ntreatment (Figure 2).\nAfter the third chemotherapy courses, the total\nand direct bilirubin increased, but transaminases\nwere normal. Moderate Pitting edema and ascites\nwere found in the patient. The liver looked large\non examination. Serum albumin ranged from 2.5\nto 3.5. Hepatic color Doppler sonography was\nnormal. Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or\nhepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) were\nsuggested based on Baltimore criteria, but the\nliver biopsy was not done.\nThe morning after the initiation of HDMT\n(Day +13), serum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin\nwere elevated to 459 U/L, 199 U/L, and 2.4 g/dL,\nrespectively.\nProthrombin time was further prolonged (16.5\nseconds; INR=1.56). BUN was 3 mg/dL and Cr\n0.4 mg/ dL. On the morning of Day +14, serum\nAST, ALT, total bilirubin, BUN, and Cr were\n1108 U/L, 489 U/L, 2.9 g/ dL, 5 mg/dL, and 0.5\nmg/dL, respectively. By Day +15, serum AST,\nALT, total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin had risen\nto 1494 U/L, 781 U/L, 3.4 g/dL, and 1.51 g/dL,\nrespectively. Thereafter, the patient’s condition\nimproved gradually. One week later (Day +20),\nserum AST, ALT, and total bilirubin returned to\n91 U/L, 197 U/L, and 1.4 g/dL, respectively.\nBlood and urine cultures were sterile.\nDefibrotide is the standard treatment for hepatic\nVOD; however, this drug was not available in Iran.\nWe treated him with an alternative protocol\nas follows:\nMethyl prednisolone pulse (30 mg/kg/d for\nthree days) and UDCA (20 mg/kg/d)\nThe Ethics Committee of the Lorestan\nUniversity of Medical Sciences approved the\npresent case presentation (Ethics Code:\nIR.LUMS.REC.1400.304). Written informed\nconsent was received from the patient.\n559\n\nDiscussion\nCytoreductive chemotherapy regimen in AML\ncauses certain life-threatening complications, such\nas refractory thrombocytopenia, sinusoidal\nobstruction syndrome, and cardiovascular\nproblems. Therefore, using the classic treatment\nof these challenges face limitations in the Iranian\nAML patients. Defibrotide is believed to be one\nof effective drugs for SOS, which is not available\nin Iran. Moreover, the use of eltrombopag in AML\npatients is accompanied with a high risk of disease\nprogression.\nThrombocytopenia in AML is a life-threatening\nproblem with a few treatment options. Platelet\ntransfusions are limited by alloimmunization.\nFrequent transfusion of ABO-mismatched\nplatelets leads to early platelet refractoriness.\nABO-mismatched platelets are as effective as\nmatched platelets in patients with low-titer\nisoagglutinins, such as oncologic patients or those\nrequiring only a few transfusions. However, the\ngreater incidence of early refractoriness induced\nin major mismatched group (MMG) patients\nindicates that ABO-mismatched platelets should\nnot be given to patients with marrow failure\nrequiring a long-term support.4 Concerning our\npatient, ABO-mismatched platelet was probably\ntransfused due to the situation.\nFurthermore, Rituximab, plasma exchange,\nand intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are new\ntreatment strategies for severe HLA alloimmune\nplatelet refractoriness. These options can overcome\nsevere platelet refractoriness owing to polyspecific HLA alloimmunization.5 Our patient\nreceived IVIg without any response. We did not\nhave any time for weekly Rituximab efficacy.\nEP is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist,\nwhich increases platelet counts and has preclinical\nantileukemic activity.\nIn 2015, multi-center, randomized, placebocontrolled, trial patients aged 18 years or older,\nreceived EP doses up to 300 mg on a daily basis.\nThere was an acceptable safety profile in patients\nwith advanced myelodysplastic syndrome or acute\nmyeloid leukemia.6\nThe treatment with EP results in a reduction\nin free intracellular iron in leukemic cells in a\nMiddle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563\n\n\fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\ndose-dependent manner. Increased intracellular\niron eliminates the antiproliferative and induction\neffects of EP cell differentiation. Its antileukemic\neffects have been shown to be mediated by\nchanges in the amount of intracellular iron.7\nEP is also a safe and effective therapy for\nrefractory thrombocytopenia after haplo-HSCT.8\nIt could reduce platelet transfusion requirements\nin thrombocytopenic patients with advanced MDS\nand AML. EP might also be a treatment option\nfor thrombocytopenic patients with AML or MDS,\nwho are ineligible for other treatments and are\nnot receiving disease-modifying treatment EP as\nescalated dose from 50 mg daily up to 200 mg\ndaily up to 200 mg daily well-tolerated and has\nmodest responses in heavily treated,\npredominantly higher-risk MDS patients or\nMDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or\nAML after HMA failure.9\nAnother use of EP in leukemia settings is in\nthe treatment of severe refractory thrombocytopenia in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia\n(CML),10 and in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)\nsecondary to chronic lymphoproliferative disorder\n(CLL).11\nTherefore, we did not worry about leukemia\nrelapse during the drug use.\nWe treated our patient with dose 1 mg/kg/d\nbecause of the cost of drug. In addition, we utilized\nPrednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/d for a synergistic effect\nas a synergistic drug.\nIn 2016, a number of newly diagnosed AML\npatients aged >60 years (yrs) with ECOG scores\nof 0-2, no active second malignancy, and no\nevidence of marrow fibrosis at the time of AML\ndiagnosis were treated with anthracycline\n(daunorubicin at 45_mg/m2 or Idarubicin at 12\nmg/m2 x 3 days) and cytarabine (100 mg/m2 × 7\ndays). Eltrombopag was administered and started\nfrom day 15. This study suggested that\neltrombopag can accelerate platelet recovery,\npotentially reduce platelet transfusions, and\nincrease complete remission rate (CR) in older\nAML patients.12\nRegarding our patient, we did not detect any\nsigns of relapse during eltrombopag\nadministration.\nMiddle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563\n\nNonetheless, in 2019, Dr. Frey reported that\neltrombopag in combination with induction of\nchemotherapy in patients with AML did not have\nfavorable outcomes.13 Despite this report, we\nshould have used this drug herein since other\ntreatments, such as platelet transfusion and IVIg,\nwere not efficacious.\nHepatic VOD, also called sinusoidal\nobstruction syndrome (SOS), rapidly progresses\nand involves life-threatening complications that\ncan occur in patients receiving chemotherapy\nand/or bone marrow transplantation after heavy\nchemotherapy regimens. K+-sparing diuretic, low\nprotein diet, and non-absorbable oral antibiotics\nare the general strategies for the management of\nthis situation.\nHepatic VOD or sinusoidal obstruction\nsyndrome is one of the adverse effects of\nchemotherapy drugs or severe combined\nchemotherapy regimens.\nChemotherapy-induced Sinusoidal Injury (CSI)\nscore is a tool used as an immunohistochemical\npanel consisting of CD34, SMA, and GS. It may\nserve as an objective marker of chemotherapyinduced sinusoidal injury and could be conducive\nto diagnosis of this peculiar form of liver injury.\nUnfortunately, due to severe thrombocytopenia,\npediatric gastrointestinal service rejects liver\nbiopsy.\nPlatelet transfusions should be limited as much\nas possible because repeated platelet transfusion\nincreases the risk of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction.\nThis was not possible in our patient because there\nwas a risk of life-threatening bleeding due to\nsevere thrombocytopenia. Properly assessing fluid\nand electrolyte balance may be difficult due to\nthe accumulation of ascites during SOS. In these\ncases, aggressive treatment with diuretics should\nbe avoided due to the severe reduction in effective\nintravascular volume, which is prone to\naccumulation of sludge in the liver sinusoids.\nDefibrotide is now the first-line therapy IV\nduring the first 17-21 days.14\nHowever, Defibrotide is not available in Iran\nand our patient had a life-threatening situation.\nIn 2008, Lun Chen and colleagues reported a\ncase of rhabdomyosarcoma in a 21-month-old\n560\n\n\fBabak Abdolkarimi et al.\n\nboy who developed pancytopenia, dyspnea,\njaundice, massive ascites, and body weight gain\nof more than 10% after receiving conventional\nchemotherapy. Hepatic VOD was diagnosed. He\nrecovered after supportive care and treatment\nwith high-dose methylprednisolone. He was\ndiagnosed with VOD based on the abovementioned findings, and Solumedrol was\nadministered (15 mg/kg, every 12 hours for six\ndoses).15\nIn addition, the third challenging problem in\nour patient was the combination of severe thrombocytopenia and masssive pericardial effusion,\nwhich required pericardiocentesis, but due to\nsevere thrombocytopenia, needle aspiration was\nnot possible in this patient. Severe thrombocytopenia limited needle aspiration through the\npericardium. Therefore, we had to treat our patient\nwith medication. Moreover, there was counterindication concerning ASA and other NSAIDs in our\ncase.\nColchicine is an anti-inflammatory agent used\nto treat gout and BehÁet's disease. In gout, it is\nless preferred to NSAIDs or steroids. Some of\nits other uses include the prevention of pericarditis\nand familial Mediterranean fever.\nRecent studies have reported that it is effective\nin the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. In our\npatient, we administered a combination of\nprednisone (2 mg/kg/d) and Colchicine (0.5 mg/d).\nIn 2013, Colchicine was used (at a dose of 0.5\nmg) twice daily for 3 months for adult patients\nwith acute pericarditis weighing >70 kg and 0.5\nmg once a day for those weighing ≤70 kg. These\npatients treated with Colchicine added to\nconventional anti-inflammatory therapy,\nsignificantly reduced the rate of incessant or\nrecurrent pericarditis.16\nExperience with colchicine in the treatment\nof malignant pericardial effusion in solid tumors\nis relatively extensive, but experience with the\nuse of this drug in the management of pericardial\neffusion due to leukemia is very limited. It is not\na routine treatment.\nColchicine was administered as an adjunctive\ntherapy after pericardiocentesis and not as a\nprimary treatment.\n561\n\nIn patients with malignant pericardial effusion\nwho underwent pericardiocentesis, the use of\nColchicine was associated with less all-cause\nmortality and reduced the need for subsequent\ninterventions. In our patient, we only used drug\ntherapy without pericardiocentesis.\nColchicine should be frequently administered\nin patients with adhesions and constriction after\ninitial catheter drainage. Subsequently, the course\nof high-dose steroid should continue Colchicine\nfor 4 months in order to prevent constriction.17\nThe concomitant occurrence of sinus\nobstruction syndrome (SOS) and refractory and\nsevere thrombocytopenia, which requires repeated\nplatelet transfusions, is a challenging and\ndangerous dilemma for the oncologist because\nrepeated platelet transfusion cause platelets\naccumulation in the liver to repair sinusoidal cell\ndamage, and these conditions creates critical and\ndangerous conditions for the patient while\nreceiving myeloablative chemotherapeutic agents\ncaused by SOS. This phenomenon also act as a\nplatelet sequestration place.\nEndothelial protective therapy or antiplatelet\ntherapy, such as ASA, may be helpful in treating\nSOS. However, antiplatelet therapy had counterindication in our patient due to severe\nthrombocytopenia, but the treatment of endothelial\ninflammation of the liver sinusoids with a steroid\npulse could facilitate the management of SOS in\nthe absence of the drug of choice (defibrothyde)\nand save the patient's life.18\nThe interaction between Colchicine and platelet\nfunction was another challenge in this patient.\nColchicine may have a beneficial cardiovascular\neffect by targeting the platelet-inflammatory axis.\nWhether targeting this pathway in vivo can offer\nprotection from atherothrombosis without\nincreasing the bleeding risk observed with\ntraditional platelet-directed therapies remains\nunknown, for which future investigation is\nrequired.19\n\nConclusion\nIn acute myeloid leukemia drugs, the sideeffects are known to be a big challenge for\noncologists. In developing countries, the use of\nMiddle East J Cancer 2022; 13(3): 556-563\n\n\fCorticosteroid and Colchicin Combination in Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nalternative therapies in the management of these\ncomplications instead of expensive and\nunattainable drugs is one of the most innovative\ntreatment options for patients. The most important\nadvantage of this solution is its cost-effectiveness\nand high efficacy. Steroids in various doses, along\nwith Colchicine, have a life-saving role in\nimproving the life-threatening side-effects of\ndrugs in the liver (sinusoidal obstruction\nsyndrome), heart (pericarditis), and bone marrow\n(transfusion-associated GVHD) of cancer patients.\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\n9.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Amirpasha\nTabaeian, associate professor of Gastroenterology,\nIran University of Medical Sciences for their\nhelpful comments.\n\n10.\n\nConflict of Interest\nNone declared.\n\nReferences\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n6.\n\nHijiya N, Ness KK, Ribeiro RC, Hudson MM.
