In\n2016, the estimated cost of prescription drug–related\nmorbidity and mortality was more than $528 billion in\nthe United States.1–3 Here, we discuss the importance\nof clinician awareness of potential medication interactions and the increased risk of adverse events\nbecause of multidrug interactions.\nA 55-year-old woman with a medical history significant for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) status\npostalcohol septal ablation 3 years prior and chronic kidney disease stage 3 presented to our emergency department with complete heart block with a heart rate of 26\nbpm and blood pressure of 76/52 mm Hg (Figure 1A).\nShe had no history of syncope or ventricular\n\narrhythmias. She was given atropine and started on\ntranscutaneous pacing and subsequently transitioned to\nnorepinephrine and dopamine with improvement in her\nheart rate and blood pressure (Figure 1B). Troponin was\n0.01 ng/mL (reference range: 0.00–0.04 ng/mL), and an\nechocardiogram during this admission showed global\nhyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function with a\ncalculated 2D ejection fraction of 82%, increased proximal interventricular septal thickness, and turbulent flow\nacross the left ventricular outflow tract with a peak gradient of 35 mm Hg and maximum velocity of 3.00 m/s\nbecause of the hyperdynamic state. There were no\nregional wall motion abnormalities.\nReview of her home medications revealed that her\ndaily metoprolol dose was 300 mg. She also takes longacting diltiazem 360 mg daily, omeprazole 20 mg\ndaily, and escitalopram 20 mg daily, which was\n\nFIGURE 1.

Effect of the interactions between metoprolol, diltiazem, escitalopram, and omeprazole on metoprolol\nlevels.\n\nincreased from 10 mg to 20 mg several weeks before\npresentation. Several drug interactions to take note of\ninclude those between metoprolol and escitalopram,\nmetoprolol and diltiazem, and escitalopram and omeprazole (Figure 2). One research article suggests that\nescitalopram results in a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in the\nbioavailability of metoprolol, while omeprazole may\nincrease escitalopram levels by 50%–100%.4,5 Furthermore, it is well-documented that the combination of\nmetoprolol and diltiazem can further increase the risk\nof atrioventricular block (AVB) compared with diltiazem alone because of their synergistic effect. In addition, in patients with chronic renal failure, diltiazem\nconcentrations can be increased by 25%.6,7\nMetoprolol is a widely used medication in the treatment of angina, atrial fibrillation/flutter, heart failure,\nhypertension, and myocardial infarction. It predominantly\nantagonizes b1-adrenergic receptors with minimal to no\neffect on b2-adrenergic receptors at oral doses of less than\n100 mg. However, with increasing plasma concentrations,\nmetoprolol’s relative b1-selectivity decreases and b2adrenergic receptor blockade increases, particularly at\nplasma concentrations greater than 300 nmol/L.8,9\nThe increasing metoprolol plasma concentrations\nbecause of concomitant usage of diltiazem and escitalopram in the setting of an already high dose of metoprolol\nand known history of HCM likely precipitated our\npatient’s episode of third-degree AVB. Although she had\nbeen on a steady dose of 300 mg of metoprolol daily for\nalmost 3 years, we hypothesize that the prolonged duration\nbetween onset of combined therapy and presentation may\nbe multifactorial because of the relatively recent doubling\nof her dose of escitalopram in the setting of some degree of\npre-existing AVB and conduction disturbance because of\nher history of HCM.6,10 Her clinical presentation did not\nsuggest any other cause for her third-degree AVB.\nAs patients are started on new medications or have\ntheir medication doses adjusted, it is imperative for\nclinicians to identify potential interactions between\nthe newly prescribed or adjusted medication(s) and\nthe pre-existing medications on their medication list.\nAmerican Journal of Therapeutics (2022) 0(0)\n\nThis will ultimately help decrease the rate of adverse\nevents related to multidrug interactions and prevent\npossibly fatal outcomes.\nStephanie L.
