We describe three cases of newly\r\ndiagnosed PTB in COVID-19 patients treated at our centre and their clinical and radiological\r\nfeatures. The challenges associated with diagnosis and management are also explored. Patient 1\r\nwas a case of smear positive, endobronchial tuberculosis incidentally diagnosed due to CT\r\nchanges, and eventually made good recovery. Patient 2 was a case of COVID-19 who succumbed\r\nbut was diagnosed posthumously due to a positive sputum culture for tuberculosis. Patient 3\r\nshowed radiographic features of PTB and was treated empirically for TB. In conclusion, COVID-19\r\nand PTB coinfection should be suspected in the presence of constitutional symptoms, prior\r\nimmunocompromised states, prolonged respiratory symptoms or fever, or unresolved radiological\r\nabnormalities, more so in regions where TB is endemic.\r\nList of abbreviations\r\nTB tuberculosis\r\nPTB pulmonary tuberculosis\r\nCT computed tomography\r\nWHO World Health Organization\r\nNPOP nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal\r\nCTPA computed tomography pulmonary angiogram\r\nHRCT high resolution computed tomography\r\nGGO ground glass opacities\r\nATT anti-tuberculous therapy\r\nIGRA interferon-gamma release assay\r\n* Corresponding author.
