It is caused by intense\r\nemotions such as anger, happiness or excitement and lasts for a short time, up to two\r\nminutes. Consciousness is maintained during the episodes. The Status Cataplecticus is\r\na rare manifestation of cataplexy, with few cases described in literature, in which the\r\nattacks are more intense and prolonged. It is usually triggered by the abrupt withdrawal\r\nof antidepressant medication. Objective: To describe Status Cataplecticus, a rare\r\nmanifestation of narcolepsy. Methods: Clinical and complementary evaluation by\r\npolysomnography (PSG) and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), in a protocol for\r\nwithdrawal of antidepressant medication, to confirm narcolepsy diagnosis. Results: We\r\ndescribe a 64-year-old female patient referred to our sleep center due to excessive\r\ndaytime sleepiness investigation for 12 years. She had a depression diagnosis and had\r\nbeen using SNRI (venlafaxine). Patient complaints are recurrent episodes of involuntary\r\nsleep throughout the day with functional impairment in daily activities. She also relates\r\nfragmented and non-restorative sleep. She describes frequent episodes of atypical\r\ncataplexy, not associated to emotional triggers. There is no report of hallucinations or\r\nvivid dreams. The prior investigation included PSG, MSLT and imaging exams with\r\nnormal results. We decided to start a new investigation with PSG and MLST but in the\r\nabsence of SNRI in a hospital day admission to control possible adverse effects. The\r\npatient presented a Status Cataplecticus after withdrawal of medication characterized\r\nby dysarthria, generalized muscle weakness, axial and appendicular drop, abolished\r\ntendon reflexes, and sustained consciousness. MLST results confirmed narcolepsy with\r\nmean sleep latency of 5.1 minutes and 4 episodes of SOREMP plus 1 SOREMP on the\r\nPSG. Conclusion: The Status Cataplecticus is a rare condition, often described after\r\nabrupt withdrawal of antidepressants, instead of the traditional cataplexy triggers. This\r\nis due to the decrease in noradrenergic and serotoninergic tone by disinhibition of REMon\r\nneurons. It is important to emphasize the use of appropriate confirmatory tests for\r\nnarcolepsy diagnosis, such as PSG followed by MSLT, in the absence of medications\r\nand confounding elements such as sleep deprivation.\r\nAUTHOR KEYWORDS\r\ncataplexy\r\nnarcolepsy\r\nStatus Cataplecticus\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nantidepressant agent; venlafaxine\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\ncataplexy; depression; narcolepsy\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nadult; case report; clinical article; clinical evaluation; conference abstract;\r\nRecord downloaded - Fri 7 29 09:05:46 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nconsciousness; daily life activity; diagnosis; drug therapy; drug withdrawal;\r\ndysarthria; excessive daytime sleepiness; female; functional disease; hallucination;\r\nhuman; middle aged; muscle weakness; nerve cell; polysomnography; side effect;\r\nsleep deprivation; sleep latency; tendon reflex; vivid dream\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\nvenlafaxine \r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L638458554&from=\r\n",{"entities":[[245,248,"REPORTERTITLE"],[249,252,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[253,267,"REPORTERMIDDLENAME"],[268,275,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[353,382,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[384,393,"REPORTERCITY"],[399,406,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[933,1122,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1148,1172,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1174,1194,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1196,1206,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1228,1252,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1254,1263,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1265,1275,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1287,1302,"TESTNAME"],[1304,1321,"TESTNAME"],[1323,1350,"TESTNAME"],[1371,1395,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1397,1406,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1408,1418,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[2522,2533,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[2534,2540,"PATIENTSEX"],[2653,2663,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[2700,2711,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2995,3049,"PATIENTMEDICALHISTORYTEXT"],[4225,4236,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[4291,4301,"DRUGINDICATION"]]}]]}
