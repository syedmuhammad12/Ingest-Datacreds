HS does not have well\u0002delineated diagnostic criteria but is commonly described\r\nas an acute nonallergic reaction to a medication (typically a\r\nlocal anesthetic), characterized by visual hallucinations, anx\u0002iety surrounding one’s own death, and mood changes, usually\r\nwithout a change in sensorium. These changes are typically\r\nself-limited, resolve in hours to days, and do not have a\r\nlasting effect.2–7 Although HS has been described from par\u0002enteral lidocaine in treating chronic noncancer pain7 and\r\npostcardiac arrest,4 it has not yet been described in the setting\r\nof a patient with advanced cancer. Ethics approval for this\r\ncase report was not deemed necessary.\r\nCase Report\r\nA 29-year-old South Asian woman with Ewing sarcoma\r\nof the left scapula developed cancer recurrence one year after\r\ninitial resection, with diffuse lung and bone metastases. After\r\ninitiation of palliative chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel, her\r\ncourse was complicated by rapid disease progression with\r\nincreasingly refractory pain. She transferred care from an\u0002other institution for a possible salvage therapy and was\r\nadmitted to our Solid Oncology ward for an acute pain crisis.\r\nShe described her pain as ‘‘all over her body’’ although lar\u0002gely concentrated in her ribs, low back, and pelvis. Her pain\r\nwas characterized by a deep throbbing ache that would shoot\r\ndown her legs bilaterally, thought to have a predominant\r\nneuropathic element.\r\nDuring a prior hospitalization, the patient had been started\r\non a bolus-only hydromorphone patient-controlled analge\u0002sia (PCA), which had been continued as an outpatient through\r\na Continuous Ambulatory Delivery Device. At the time of\r\nthis hospital admission, she was also on a regimen of meth\u0002adone 20/20/30 mg PO TID, acetaminophen 1000 mg PO\r\nq8 hours, duloxetine 60 mg PO qAM, and methocarbamol\r\n750 mg PO QID. Despite uptitration of her hydromorphone\r\nPCA to a 2.5 mg IV bolus q10 minutes prn (no basal rate) and\r\neventual transition to a fentanyl PCA up to a 150 mcg IV\r\nbolus q10 minutes prn with a 25 mcg/hour basal rate, the\r\npatient’s pain remained poorly controlled.\r\nAn interdisciplinary approach involving the palliative care\r\nand interventional pain teams was used to guide and discuss\r\n1\r\nDepartment of Medicine, West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.\r\n2\r\nDepartment of Medicine, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.\r\ni\r\nORCID ID (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4099-6282).\r\niiORCID ID (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1413-482X).\r\nAccepted September 23, 2021.\r\nJOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE\r\nVolume XX, Number XX, 2021\r\nª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\r\nDOI: 10.1089/jpm.2021.0265\r\n1\r\nDownloaded by Malawi Hinari Band 1 from www.liebertpub.com at 02/05/22. For personal use only. \r\nfurther options. A ketamine infusion was initiated and even\u0002tually titrated up to 0.3 mg/kg/hour but did not result in ad\u0002equate pain relief. An intrathecal drug delivery system was\r\nimplanted on hospital day (HD) six with constant infusion of\r\nintrathecal hydromorphone (9.8 mg qday) and bupivacaine\r\n(6.5 mg qday) without ziconotide. Despite this regimen, new\r\nand enlarging spinal metastases contributed to severe radic\u0002ular pain in her upper and lower extremities. The patient\r\ninquired about an intravenous lidocaine infusion, which, dur\u0002ing prior hospitalizations, had resulted in significant relief\r\nthat persisted even after the infusion was stopped.\r\nAn intravenous lidocaine infusion was initiated on HD 16\r\nwith a loading dose of 2 mg/kg followed by a continuous infu\u0002sion of 1 mg/kg/hour, based on ideal body weight. The patient\r\nreported significant relief after the bolus dose and was able to\r\nachieve continuous relief with ongoing titration of her lidocaine\r\ninfusion. Ketamine infusion was discontinued one hour after\r\ninitiation of parenteral lidocaine. The lidocaine infusion rate\r\nwas titrated to a maximum of 1.6 mg/kg/hour on hospital day 17,\r\nat which time the patient reported perioral numbness but denied\r\ntinnitus, tremor, or myoclonus. At that point plasma levels of\r\nlidocaine were elevated to 7.2 mcg/mL. As the lidocaine infu\u0002sion was decreased to 1 mg/kg/hour, plasma levels normalized\r\nto consistently <5 mcg/mL with continued relief of pain.\r\nOn HD 19, the patient developed worsening bilateral lower\r\nextremity weakness and numbness suggestive of progres\u0002sive spinal cord compression. Dexamethasone 10 mg IV qAM\r\nwas started on HD 20 to provide relief of compression and\r\npain as the patient was not a surgical candidate. On HD 25,\r\ndexamethasone was increased to 10 mg IV q8 hours in the\r\nhopes of reducing bony pain and compression. On HD 27, the\r\npatient began to have increasingly frequent hallucinations\r\nrelated to her death, beginning with seeing the spirits of dead\r\nfamily members. She was able to identify these as halluci\u0002nations and was not distressed by them; rather, she found\r\nthese hallucinations helpful in processing her mortality and\r\nproviding closure to her family. She maintained a clear\r\nsensorium throughout this period, and was aware that her\r\nhallucinations were not real, with good attention during con\u0002versation, making steroid induced delirium less likely. Owing\r\nto the nature of her hallucinations (related to her death), while\r\nmaintaining a clear sensorium, these changes were thought to\r\nbe most consistent with HS secondary to her lidocaine infu\u0002sion. Given that these hallucinations were helpful in her pro\u0002cessing her mortality and that her primary goal was pain relief,\r\na shared decision was made to continue parenteral lidocaine.\r\nIn the following days, however, these hallucinations be\u0002came increasingly persecutory and centered around death.\r\nThe patient described ‘‘talking to God’’ who was ‘‘angry with\r\n[her] for using the PCA.’’ She shared being ‘‘trapped in\r\nPurgatory and waiting to be taken to Hell.’’ At this time,\r\nshe began wearing a traditional religious head covering and\r\npraying fervently while confessing her sins. According to her\r\nfamily, these behaviors were extremely uncharacteristic, as\r\nshe had never professed a strong religious identity in the past.\r\nGiven the improvement in her neuropathic pain, her lido\u0002caine infusion was continued while attempts were made to\r\ncontrol the symptoms of HS. The distress caused by her\r\nhallucinations were unresponsive to nightly olanzapine but\r\ndid improve with doses of oral and intravenous lorazepam.\r\nAs dexamethasone was reduced to once daily dosing and\r\nlidocaine was weaned, these death-focused hallucinations\r\nstopped. The patient reported greater clarity, although she\r\nwas somnolent due to increased opioids. The patient was\r\ntransitioned to hospice on a reduced dose continuous lido\u0002caine infusion and died at home.\r\nDiscussion\r\nHS was first noted in 19518 and was later given its eponym\r\nin 1959 by Drs. Hoigne and Schoch9 who noted that a mi\u0002nority of patients who received intramuscular procaine pen\u0002icillin developed rapid onset anxiety about death, dissipating\r\nwithin hours without lasting consequences.\r\nTypically, patients with HS have acute psychiatric changes\r\nthat develop within minutes of subcutaneous or intramuscular\r\nmedication administration and can occur days after an offend\u0002ing infusion is initiated.4 Reactions from subcutaneous or in\u0002tramuscular injections are thought to be related to inadvertent\r\nintravenous injections.5 The most common symptom reported\r\nis anxiety about impending death, commonly called ‘‘doom\r\nanxiety’’ or ‘‘death anxiety.4,5’’ Patients also can develop agi\u0002tation, mood changes, and auditory or visual hallucinations.\r\nAlthough some case reports describe patients becoming acutely\r\nconfused, typically patients maintain normal orientation and\r\ncan discern that their hallucinations are not real, differentiating\r\nthis from delirium. These psychiatric effects resolve within\r\nhours of removal of the offending medication, with anxiety and\r\nsleep disturbances at times lasting days to weeks.2,3\r\nThe pathophysiology initially was thought to be mediated\r\nby procaine penicillin crystal microembolization going from\r\nthe venous system to the brain.9 This theory has fallen out\r\nof favor with the absence of pulmonary symptoms which one\r\nwould expect as microemboli move through the pulmonary\r\nvasculature. Furthermore, microemboli would likely cause\r\nmore heterogeneous deficits from scattered emboli, whereas\r\nthe psychiatric changes in HS are relatively consistent.10\r\nMore recently, it has been hypothesized that the symptoms\r\nof HS may be related to limbic kindling.10 Kindling is the\r\nheightened physiological response to a stimulus after multi\u0002ple initial exposures do not have a response. Pathophysiolo\u0002gical kindling is supported by a case series showing that HS\r\ntypically only occurs after multiple prior doses of procaine\r\npenicillin, and that the anxiety and perceptual changes seen\r\nin HS resemble temporal lobe epilepsy.10 Our patient had\r\npreviously received lidocaine infusions for intractable neu\u0002ropathic pain at another institution, yet per family’s report,\r\nshe did not have symptoms characteristic of HS during those\r\ninfusions. Prior case series have demonstrated a theoretical\r\nlink between anxiety disorders and HS, with high rates of\r\npanic disorder found in a cohort of patients after an acute\r\nepisode of HS. With many of these patients there was concern\r\nfor an anxiety disorder preceding their acute episode of HS,\r\nraising the possibility that anxiety disorders may predispose\r\npatients to HS, although this remains unclear. In our patient\r\nshe did not have any previously diagnosed anxiety disorders.3\r\nAlthough HS from lidocaine or procaine does not appear\r\nto represent an overdose of local anesthetics,2 it is unclear if\r\nHS is dose responsive, as opposed to the more common and\r\npredictable side effects of tinnitus and oral numbness that\r\nroughly correlate to plasma lidocaine levels. In our case, the\r\npatient developed HS while having plasma levels <5 mcg/mL,\r\nalthough symptoms did improve with dose reduction of her\r\ninfusion.\r\n2 SPIKER ET AL.\r\nDownloaded by Malawi Hinari Band 1 from www.liebertpub.com at 02/05/22. For personal use only. \r\nThe most common reported cases of HS have been from\r\nlocal injections of procaine penicillin, although studies have\r\nvaried as to whether procaine or penicillin is the identified as\r\nculprit.5,9 Since the initial reports were first documented by\r\nHoigne and Batchelor, case series have documented intra\u0002venous lidocaine causing death-related anxiety and halluci\u0002nations in patients postcardiac arrest.4 Case reports have also\r\ndocumented HS from antimicrobials, including clarithro\u0002mycin, ceftriaxone, and meglumine.6,11,12 One case report\r\nalso documented HS secondary to a nail bed prednisolone\r\ninjection.13\r\nThe primary treatment for HS is discontinuing the of\u0002fending agent, as symptoms typically resolve within minutes\r\nto hours. Multiple case reports have also documented im\u0002provement in agitation from short-term intravenous benzo\u0002diazepine use; both lorazepam (1 mg IV) and midazolam\r\n(4 mg IV) have been reported as being effective in acutely\r\nmanaging the anxiety and agitation from HS.2,7\r\nSince our patient was near the end of life, our case posed\r\nsome unique challenges when managing HS. First, the patient\r\ninitially found therapeutic benefit from the HS-associated\r\nhallucinations in processing her mortality. Second, the pa\u0002tient had refractory cancer pain that was only well controlled\r\nwith parenteral lidocaine. Through shared decision making\r\nwith the patient and her family, the decision was made to\r\ncontinue the infusion, acknowledging that the hallucinations\r\ncould become increasingly distressing over time. When the\r\nhallucinations became more persecutory, completely stop\u0002ping the lidocaine was not thought to be realistic given the\r\nbenefit in controlling her previously refractory pain. Again,\r\nwith shared decision making, we decreased the dose of her\r\ninfusion and added adjunctive benzodiazepines to minimize\r\nthe distressing nature of her hallucinations while maintaining\r\ngood analgesia.1\r\nThe concurrent use of dexamethasone raises the possibility\r\nthat some of her symptoms could have been attributed to\r\nsteroid-induced delirium. Moreover, as her symptoms im\u0002proved with reduction of both dexamethasone and lidocaine\r\nsimultaneously, it is difficult to differentiate the sole source\r\nof her symptoms. However, because she was aware that her\r\nhallucinations were not real, maintained a clear sensorium,\r\nwith persecutory hallucinations centered around her death,\r\nwe felt that her clinical syndrome was more closely aligned\r\nwith HS.\r\nConclusion\r\nWith the increasing use of parenteral lidocaine for refrac\u0002tory cancer pain, palliative care providers should be aware of\r\nHS as a possible complication that can occur with repeated\r\nor prolonged use. Although typically represented as a dis\u0002tressing psychiatric syndrome, this case demonstrates that\r\nwhen patients are near the end of life, hallucinations centered\r\naround one’s own death are not necessarily harmful and may\r\nbe helpful in processing their mortality. In addition, when\r\npatients are near the end of life and lidocaine has been useful\r\nfor refractory pain, stopping it may not be realistic. In our\r\ncase adding adjunctive benzodiazepines and decreasing the\r\ninfusion were both helpful in reducing the distressing nature\r\nof the hallucinations and anxiety secondary to HS while\r\nmaintaining adequate analgesia.\r\nAuthors’ Contributions\r\nAll named authors were involved in the writing of this\r\ncase.\r\nFunding Information\r\nThere is no funding to report.\r\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\r\nNo competing financial interests exist.\r\nReferences\r\n1.

Despite this regimen, new\r\nand enlarging spinal metastases contributed to severe radic\u0002ular pain in her upper and lower extremities. The patient\r\ninquired about an intravenous lidocaine infusion, which, dur\u0002ing prior hospitalizations, had resulted in significant relief\r\nthat persisted even after the infusion was stopped.\r\nAn intravenous lidocaine infusion was initiated on HD 16\r\nwith a loading dose of 2 mg/kg followed by a continuous infu\u0002sion of 1 mg/kg/hour, based on ideal body weight. The patient\r\nreported significant relief after the bolus dose and was able to\r\nachieve continuous relief with ongoing titration of her lidocaine\r\ninfusion. Ketamine infusion was discontinued one hour after\r\ninitiation of parenteral lidocaine. The lidocaine infusion rate\r\nwas titrated to a maximum of 1.6 mg/kg/hour on hospital day 17,\r\nat which time the patient reported perioral numbness but denied\r\ntinnitus, tremor, or myoclonus. At that point plasma levels of\r\nlidocaine were elevated to 7.2 mcg/mL. As the lidocaine infu\u0002sion was decreased to 1 mg/kg/hour, plasma levels normalized\r\nto consistently <5 mcg/mL with continued relief of pain.\r\nOn HD 19, the patient developed worsening bilateral lower\r\nextremity weakness and numbness suggestive of progres\u0002sive spinal cord compression. Dexamethasone 10 mg IV qAM\r\nwas started on HD 20 to provide relief of compression and\r\npain as the patient was not a surgical candidate. On HD 25,\r\ndexamethasone was increased to 10 mg IV q8 hours in the\r\nhopes of reducing bony pain and compression. On HD 27, the\r\npatient began to have increasingly frequent hallucinations\r\nrelated to her death, beginning with seeing the spirits of dead\r\nfamily members. She was able to identify these as halluci\u0002nations and was not distressed by them; rather, she found\r\nthese hallucinations helpful in processing her mortality and\r\nproviding closure to her family. She maintained a clear\r\nsensorium throughout this period, and was aware that her\r\nhallucinations were not real, with good attention during con\u0002versation, making steroid induced delirium less likely. Owing\r\nto the nature of her hallucinations (related to her death), while\r\nmaintaining a clear sensorium, these changes were thought to\r\nbe most consistent with HS secondary to her lidocaine infu\u0002sion. Given that these hallucinations were helpful in her pro\u0002cessing her mortality and that her primary goal was pain relief,\r\na shared decision was made to continue parenteral lidocaine.\r\nIn the following days, however, these hallucinations be\u0002came increasingly persecutory and centered around death.\r\nThe patient described ‘‘talking to God’’ who was ‘‘angry with\r\n[her] for using the PCA.’’ She shared being ‘‘trapped in\r\nPurgatory and waiting to be taken to Hell.’’ At this time,\r\nshe began wearing a traditional religious head covering and\r\npraying fervently while confessing her sins. According to her\r\nfamily, these behaviors were extremely uncharacteristic, as\r\nshe had never professed a strong religious identity in the past.\r\nGiven the improvement in her neuropathic pain, her lido\u0002caine infusion was continued while attempts were made to\r\ncontrol the symptoms of HS. The distress caused by her\r\nhallucinations were unresponsive to nightly olanzapine but\r\ndid improve with doses of oral and intravenous lorazepam.\r\nAs dexamethasone was reduced to once daily dosing and\r\nlidocaine was weaned, these death-focused hallucinations\r\nstopped. The patient reported greater clarity, although she\r\nwas somnolent due to increased opioids. The patient was\r\ntransitioned to hospice on a reduced dose continuous lido\u0002caine infusion and died at home.\r\nDiscussion\r\nHS was first noted in 19518 and was later given its eponym\r\nin 1959 by Drs. Hoigne and Schoch9 who noted that a mi\u0002nority of patients who received intramuscular procaine pen\u0002icillin developed rapid onset anxiety about death, dissipating\r\nwithin hours without lasting consequences.\r\nTypically, patients with HS have acute psychiatric changes\r\nthat develop within minutes of subcutaneous or intramuscular\r\nmedication administration and can occur days after an offend\u0002ing infusion is initiated.4 Reactions from subcutaneous or in\u0002tramuscular injections are thought to be related to inadvertent\r\nintravenous injections.5 The most common symptom reported\r\nis anxiety about impending death, commonly called ‘‘doom\r\nanxiety’’ or ‘‘death anxiety.4,5’’ Patients also can develop agi\u0002tation, mood changes, and auditory or visual hallucinations.\r\nAlthough some case reports describe patients becoming acutely\r\nconfused, typically patients maintain normal orientation and\r\ncan discern that their hallucinations are not real, differentiating\r\nthis from delirium. These psychiatric effects resolve within\r\nhours of removal of the offending medication, with anxiety and\r\nsleep disturbances at times lasting days to weeks.2,3\r\nThe pathophysiology initially was thought to be mediated\r\nby procaine penicillin crystal microembolization going from\r\nthe venous system to the brain.9 This theory has fallen out\r\nof favor with the absence of pulmonary symptoms which one\r\nwould expect as microemboli move through the pulmonary\r\nvasculature. Furthermore, microemboli would likely cause\r\nmore heterogeneous deficits from scattered emboli, whereas\r\nthe psychiatric changes in HS are relatively consistent.10\r\nMore recently, it has been hypothesized that the symptoms\r\nof HS may be related to limbic kindling.10 Kindling is the\r\nheightened physiological response to a stimulus after multi\u0002ple initial exposures do not have a response. Pathophysiolo\u0002gical kindling is supported by a case series showing that HS\r\ntypically only occurs after multiple prior doses of procaine\r\npenicillin, and that the anxiety and perceptual changes seen\r\nin HS resemble temporal lobe epilepsy.10 Our patient had\r\npreviously received lidocaine infusions for intractable neu\u0002ropathic pain at another institution, yet per family’s report,\r\nshe did not have symptoms characteristic of HS during those\r\ninfusions. Prior case series have demonstrated a theoretical\r\nlink between anxiety disorders and HS, with high rates of\r\npanic disorder found in a cohort of patients after an acute\r\nepisode of HS. With many of these patients there was concern\r\nfor an anxiety disorder preceding their acute episode of HS,\r\nraising the possibility that anxiety disorders may predispose\r\npatients to HS, although this remains unclear. In our patient\r\nshe did not have any previously diagnosed anxiety disorders.3\r\nAlthough HS from lidocaine or procaine does not appear\r\nto represent an overdose of local anesthetics,2 it is unclear if\r\nHS is dose responsive, as opposed to the more common and\r\npredictable side effects of tinnitus and oral numbness that\r\nroughly correlate to plasma lidocaine levels. In our case, the\r\npatient developed HS while having plasma levels <5 mcg/mL,\r\nalthough symptoms did improve with dose reduction of her\r\ninfusion.\r\n2 SPIKER ET AL.\r\nDownloaded by Malawi Hinari Band 1 from www.liebertpub.com at 02/05/22. For personal use only. \r\nThe most common reported cases of HS have been from\r\nlocal injections of procaine penicillin, although studies have\r\nvaried as to whether procaine or penicillin is the identified as\r\nculprit.5,9 Since the initial reports were first documented by\r\nHoigne and Batchelor, case series have documented intra\u0002venous lidocaine causing death-related anxiety and halluci\u0002nations in patients postcardiac arrest.4 Case reports have also\r\ndocumented HS from antimicrobials, including clarithro\u0002mycin, ceftriaxone, and meglumine.6,11,12 One case report\r\nalso documented HS secondary to a nail bed prednisolone\r\ninjection.13\r\nThe primary treatment for HS is discontinuing the of\u0002fending agent, as symptoms typically resolve within minutes\r\nto hours. Multiple case reports have also documented im\u0002provement in agitation from short-term intravenous benzo\u0002diazepine use; both lorazepam (1 mg IV) and midazolam\r\n(4 mg IV) have been reported as being effective in acutely\r\nmanaging the anxiety and agitation from HS.2,7\r\nSince our patient was near the end of life, our case posed\r\nsome unique challenges when managing HS. First, the patient\r\ninitially found therapeutic benefit from the HS-associated\r\nhallucinations in processing her mortality. Second, the pa\u0002tient had refractory cancer pain that was only well controlled\r\nwith parenteral lidocaine. Through shared decision making\r\nwith the patient and her family, the decision was made to\r\ncontinue the infusion, acknowledging that the hallucinations\r\ncould become increasingly distressing over time. When the\r\nhallucinations became more persecutory, completely stop\u0002ping the lidocaine was not thought to be realistic given the\r\nbenefit in controlling her previously refractory pain. Again,\r\nwith shared decision making, we decreased the dose of her\r\ninfusion and added adjunctive benzodiazepines to minimize\r\nthe distressing nature of her hallucinations while maintaining\r\ngood analgesia.1\r\nThe concurrent use of dexamethasone raises the possibility\r\nthat some of her symptoms could have been attributed to\r\nsteroid-induced delirium. Moreover, as her symptoms im\u0002proved with reduction of both dexamethasone and lidocaine\r\nsimultaneously, it is difficult to differentiate the sole source\r\nof her symptoms. However, because she was aware that her\r\nhallucinations were not real, maintained a clear sensorium,\r\nwith persecutory hallucinations centered around her death,\r\nwe felt that her clinical syndrome was more closely aligned\r\nwith HS.\r\nConclusion\r\nWith the increasing use of parenteral lidocaine for refrac\u0002tory cancer pain, palliative care providers should be aware of\r\nHS as a possible complication that can occur with repeated\r\nor prolonged use. Although typically represented as a dis\u0002tressing psychiatric syndrome, this case demonstrates that\r\nwhen patients are near the end of life, hallucinations centered\r\naround one’s own death are not necessarily harmful and may\r\nbe helpful in processing their mortality. In addition, when\r\npatients are near the end of life and lidocaine has been useful\r\nfor refractory pain, stopping it may not be realistic. In our\r\ncase adding adjunctive benzodiazepines and decreasing the\r\ninfusion were both helpful in reducing the distressing nature\r\nof the hallucinations and anxiety secondary to HS while\r\nmaintaining adequate analgesia.\r\nAuthors’ Contributions\r\nAll named authors were involved in the writing of this\r\ncase.\r\nFunding Information\r\nThere is no funding to report.\r\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\r\nNo competing financial interests exist.\r\nReferences\r\n1.
