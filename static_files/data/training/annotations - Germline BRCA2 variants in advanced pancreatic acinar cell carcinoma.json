While there is some clinical and genotype difference, patients with\r\nPACC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are often treated as one disease entity. Evolving\r\ndata has increased our understanding of this rare tumor’s biology, treatment, and prognosis. Due to the\r\ndisease’s rarity, most data about PACC are limited to reviews, case reports, and case series. The tumor\r\nbiology of PACC is not well characterized due to the lack of tissue availability for large-scale molecular\r\nanalysis. Intriguingly, data obtained in recent years have indicated that PACC has a distinctive\r\nmutational landscape[2-4]. There is increasing interest in this area, particularly regarding the\r\nhomologous repair deficiency (HRD) signature in PACC. Chmielecki et al[2] reported up to 45%\r\ndeficiency of the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway genes in the study population. Oncogenic\r\ntherapeutic targets including RAF1 rearrangements and mismatch repair genes have proven elusive in a\r\nsignificant proportion of PACCs, and lack of tumor profiling probably contributes to low reporting[3,4].\r\nHere, we present a PACC case to emphasize the clinical application of genomic profiling in the\r\ncontext of precision medicine for better patient outcomes. Although this patient was very unwell at the\r\npresentation, raising the question of suitability for modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX), the knowledge of\r\nthe BRCA2 likely pathogenic variant (LPV) as predictive for mFFX sensitivity guided our decision to use\r\nthis regime. In the case series section, we describe the clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes, and\r\nmutational signatures of additional 10 patients with PACC treated in our center. As proof of concept, we\r\ndescribe the immediate clinical impact for the patients with distinct genomic alterations that have been\r\nassociated with sensitivity to specific chemotherapeutic or targeted agents.\r\nCASE PRESENTATION\r\nChief complaints\r\nThe patient was a 70 male smoker with recurrent lower limb joint pain and was generally unwell for the\r\nprevious year.\r\nHistory of present illness\r\nHe presented to a rheumatology service with joint pain, which was diagnosed as gout and treated with\r\nshort courses of prednisolone; however, during the steroid treatment, he also experienced central\r\nabdominal discomfort, reduced appetite, and 10 kg weight loss. He had progressive lower joint pain\r\nwith tender, warm skin nodules, which restricted mobility.\r\nLee CL et al. Institutional case series of advanced PACC\r\nWJG https://www.wjgnet.com 6423 December 7, 2022 Volume 28 Issue 45\r\nHistory of past illness\r\nHe had encephalitis and asthma as a child.\r\nPersonal and family history\r\nHe had a history of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis at age 46 for which he underwent a left\r\ntotal nephrectomy and a non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma at age 51, which was treated by lung\r\nresection. His mother died of ovarian cancer at age 72.\r\nPhysical examination\r\nPhysical examination revealed a cachectic man with a palpable liver edge and ill-defined widespread\r\nerythematous subcutaneous nodules on bilateral lower limbs (Figure 1A). Eastern Cooperative\r\nOncology Group performance status (PS) was 2.\r\nLaboratory examinations\r\nInitial blood tests demonstrated lipase > 6000 U/dL, elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase\r\n(ALT) 68 U/L and aspartate aminotransferase 58 U/L], total bilirubin 6 μmol/L, albumin 28 g/L and\r\ncreatinine 120 μmol/L (estimated glomerular filtration rate 52 mL/min). Tumor markers were: Normal\r\ncarbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 28 kU/L and raised alpha-fetoprotein 58 μg/L.\r\nImaging examinations\r\nInitial computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a bulky pancreatic tumor measuring over 16 cm\r\nand multiple liver metastases. The largest liver lesion measured over 8 cm (Figure 2A). There was an ill\u0002defined area of sclerosis in the right ischium which was suspicious of metastasis. Whole-body bone\r\nscintigraphy detected mild non-specific increased activity in the right ischium corresponding to the area\r\nof sclerosis but no significant bony abnormality. CT chest showed no evidence of thoracic metastases.\r\nFURTHER DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP\r\nThe patient underwent a liver biopsy that confirmed a poorly differentiated carcinoma staining positive\r\nfor keratin 7, CAM5.2, claudin 4, glypican 3, and A1AT. Negative markers included keratin 20, arginase\r\n1, hepPar1, synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56, and TTF1. The tumor was mismatch repair proficient.\r\nAn additional skin biopsy of one of the subcutaneous nodules confirmed pancreatic lobular panniculitis.\r\nGermline testing identified a BRCA2 LPV (c.4356delinsCA, p. Gln1452Hisfs*8).\r\nCASE SERIES\r\nPopulation and clinical data\r\nWe treated 11 PACC patients between August 2014 and July 2021 at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\r\n(PMCC), Toronto. These comprised 6 (55%) pure and 5 (45%) mixed PACC. Approximately 2000\r\npancreatic carcinoma patients were managed at PMCC during this period. The median age at diagnosis\r\nof the PACC patients was 65 years (range 57-74) and all were male. At diagnosis, 2 (18%) were\r\nresectable, 2 (18%) locally advanced, and 7 (64%) metastatic. The full demographic features of all\r\npatients are summarized in Table 1.\r\nFour (36%) patients had curative-intent surgery. Three of them developed systemic relapse and\r\nreceived subsequent treatment with palliative chemotherapy. All seven metastatic patients had\r\nchemotherapy. Altogether, ten patients received palliative chemotherapy: mFFX (6), Gemcitabine plus\r\nNab-paclitaxel (GnP) (3), and Gemcitabine (1).\r\nThe median time to progression from the date of surgery to the first systemic relapse for the resected\r\npatients was 10.5 mo (1.5-10.6). After a follow-up period of 20.4 mo, 6 (55%) patients had died of the\r\ndisease while five are still alive. The median overall survival (OS) of the cohort was 20.4 mo (range 4.6-\r\n36.0) but this variable is temporally immature. The median OS of the four resected patients was 30.3 mo\r\n(28.2-36.0).\r\nGenomic data\r\nEligibility for germline genetic testing in Ontario has evolved with the advent of next-generation\r\nsequencing, newly identified genes, and the association of established genes with different cancer types.\r\nIn April 2021, Ontario Health expanded the availability of germline testing to all individuals with\r\npancreatic cancer regardless of age or family history[5]. Before this, germline testing for individuals\r\nwith pancreatic cancer was based on personal and family history as well as the age of onset. The gene(s)\r\nor multi-gene panels performed for patients are based on the individuals’ personal and family history at\r\nthe time of the initial genetic counseling.\r\nLee CL et al.

Four patients did not have germline\r\ntesting, as they did not meet eligibility criteria based on family history at the time of their diagnosis.\r\nGermline PV/LPV was identified in four patients [2 BRCA2 (18%), 1 ATM (9%), 1 CDKN2A (9%)]. Two\r\n(18%) patients had somatic testing with whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing as part of\r\nclinical trial participation. Identified somatic variants were SND1-BRAF fusion in one patient and KRAS,\r\nSMAD4, CDKN2A, ATM, TP53, TGFBR2, and KDM6A in another patient.\r\nIn terms of actionability, we identified two patients with BRCA2 PV/LPV (18%) and one SND1-BRAF\r\nfusion (9%). The first patient carrying a germline BRCA2 LPV is described in this case report. The\r\nsecond patient carrying a germline BRCA2 PV had advanced acinar neuroendocrine carcinoma. Briefly,\r\nhe was commenced on a combination of 5 FU and Oxaliplatin with a dose reduction (30%) due to\r\ncomorbidities. Despite this, the evaluation CT scan following 8 cycles of chemotherapy showed a partial\r\nresponse of the primary tumor (63% smaller than baseline) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid\r\nTumors (RECIST) 1.1. He continued additional 4 cycles with further tumor regression, followed by\r\nresection. The tumor was pathologic near complete treatment response.\r\nThe patient harboring an SND1-BRAF fusion was commenced on first line GnP. The evaluation CT\r\nscans following 6 cycles of chemotherapy showed a significant partial response (55% decrease than\r\nbaseline) of the primary tumor and lymph nodes as per RECIST1.1. After 16 cycles of GnP, he developed\r\nprogressive disease and was switched to single-agent Cobimetinib as part of clinical trial participation.\r\nMolecular profiling was negative for other key driver mutations KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and\r\nBRCA in this patient.

Histology revealed no concurrent existence of ductal adenocarcinoma, neuroen\u0002docrine or mixed tumor of the pancreas.\r\nTREATMENT\r\nThe initial plan was to treat the patient with GnP in consideration of his poor PS. However, this decision\r\nwas changed to the mFFX regimen following the documentation of the germline BRCA2 LPV. mFFX\r\nwas administered every 2-wk with an additional 20% dose reduction of Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan\r\n(Oxaliplatin 65 mg/m2\r\n, Irinotecan 120 mg/m2\r\n, Fluorouracil 4200 mg/m2 and Folinic acid 400 mg/m2\r\n).\r\nThe chemotherapy calculations were based on a body surface area of 1.77 m2\r\n.\r\nLee CL et al.

A full septic screen revealed no clear infectious etiology. CT brain showed no brain\r\nabnormality. X-rays of several joint areas including sacroiliac joints showed no radiographic evidence of\r\nosteomyelitis or septic arthritis. A left knee joint aspiration revealed an inflammatory synovial fluid\r\nwith elevated white blood cell count, but no growth of infectious organisms and negative for crystal\r\narthropathy. Rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide levels were negative. The\r\nrheumatology team believed the patient’s inflammatory seronegative arthritis was paraneoplastic in\r\nnature. The patient also displayed clinical adverse events consistent with steroid-induced psychosis, due\r\nto the concurrent prednisolone and dexamethasone use. He was started on Naproxen with a tapering\r\ndose of prednisolone (from 15 mg daily). His condition improved within a week time and chemo\u0002therapy was resumed. Two months after starting mFFX, CT evaluation (post 4 cycles of chemotherapy)\r\nshowed a 56% partial response based on RECIST1.1. The patient had a marked improvement in sympto\u0002matology and panniculitis (Figure 1B). His PS also improved to 0. He continued to tolerate mFFX with\r\ngrade 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy of hands and feet. Another CT (post 8 cycles of chemotherapy)\r\nshowed further tumor shrinkage in the primary tumor and hepatic metastases. The sclerotic bone lesion\r\nwas unchanged in the interval. As the patient was getting a deepening partial response and tolerating\r\nmFFX, the chemotherapy was repeated for a total of 11 cycles. A CT imaging at that time point showed\r\nfurther tumor regression in the pancreatic tumor and the hepatic metastases, totaling a 70% decrease\r\nLee CL et al. Institutional case series of advanced PACC\r\nWJG https://www.wjgnet.com 6428 December 7, 2022 Volume 28 Issue 45\r\nfrom baseline (Figure 2B). The biochemical response was also seen with a CA19-9 level of 17 kU/L.\r\nAfter 11 cycles of mFFX, we decided to stop chemotherapy due to the accumulative neurotoxicity.\r\nConsidering the germline BRCA2 LPV, we elected a therapeutic switch to Olaparib, a polyadenosine\r\ndiphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi), as maintenance therapy. He was started on Olaparib\r\n150 mg twice daily dosing that was adjusted for his renal function. At the time of this writing, the\r\npatient experienced disease stability for 5 mo with Olaparib, which is ongoing. He tolerates Olaparib\r\nwith grade 1 fatigue but has no major side effects. He is on monthly follow-ups.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPACC typically presents in the younger population with a median age of 62 years old. It is more\r\nfrequent in males, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1[6-8]. The majority (50%-60%) present at an\r\nadvanced stage, with a median tumor size of 7 cm, and lesions smaller than 2 cm are rarely detected[6-\r\n10]. Some cases present with mixed differentiation including mixed acinar-ductal and mixed acinar\u0002neuroendocrine subtypes. As the tumor is predominantly found in the tail of the pancreas, patients do\r\nnot usually present with biliary obstruction, and elevation of CA19-9 is not typically seen[3,11].\r\nHowever, there have been reports of elevated alpha-fetoprotein in younger patients[7,8]. In extreme\r\ncases, up to 10%, of patients have lipase hypersecretion which leads to systemic fat necrosis with eosino\u0002philia, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, and polyarthralgia[6,7,9,10]. This paraneoplastic syndrome,\r\nalso known as Schmid’s triad, is often associated with a poor prognosis[12-15]. The prognosis of PACC\r\nis slightly better than that for PDAC[6]. In comparison, 5-year OS for PACC was 42.8% vs PDAC 3.8%\r\n[16]. In this study, we analyzed the full clinical characteristics, therapeutic outcomes, and mutational\r\nsignatures of 11 patients with PACC treated at our center. Based on our analysis, the median OS across\r\nall stages is 20.4 mo and 30.3 mo among the resected patients.\r\nAvailable literature suggests that over one-third of PACC patients harbor potentially druggable\r\nalterations such as BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, BRAF, and JAK1[17]. We observed only one PACC with\r\nsomatic KRAS mutation (9%). This result may be limited by the incomplete somatic testing rate in this\r\nstudy. In distinction to PDAC which is associated with KRAS driver mutations in more than 93% of\r\ncases, KRAS mutations occur at a much lower prevalence in the acinar/mixed neuroendocrine tumor\r\n(9%)[18-21]. While it is difficult to generalize as pancreatic carcinoma is a complex heterogeneous\r\ndisease, a strong argument can be made that the lack of mutated KRAS identifies a cohort rich in\r\ntargetable alterations including fusions, and should have access to integrative germline and somatic\r\nsequencing[22].\r\nMultiple studies including a large series reported by Chmielecki et al[2] involving 44 PACCs reported\r\na 45% deficiency of DDR pathway genes[3,4,23]. These are inclusive of deficiencies in the BRCA\r\npathway and mismatch repair. Combined results suggested that approximately 23% of PACCs are\r\nenriched with fusion rearrangements involving BRAF or RAF1 genes[2,19]. It appears that PACC\r\nsubgroups that are lacking RAF1 rearrangements (i.e., fusion-negative tumors) were significantly\r\nenriched for deficiency in HRD, and both tumor types are mutually exclusive[2]. Conceptually, these\r\n“fusion-negative” tumors can serve as a beneficial demarcation in over two-thirds of PACC patients\r\nwho may be candidates for platinum-based chemotherapy. PACC with BRCA1/2 variants have greater\r\nsensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and demonstrate significantly better OS than when treated\r\nwith non-platinum agents[24]. Platinum chemotherapy drugs exert their cytotoxic effect by binding\r\ndirectly to DNA, causing crosslinking of DNA strands and thereby inducing DNA double-strand\r\nbreaks, which also are ineffectively repaired in cells lacking functioning BRCA1/2. Both the patients in\r\nour case series with germline BRCA2 PV/LPV had substantial radiographic regression despite dose\r\nreduced Oxaliplatin. Although our patient described in the case report was very unwell with poor PS at\r\npresentation, raising the question of suitability for mFFX, the knowledge of the BRCA2 LPV as\r\npredictive for platinum sensitivity guided our decision to use this regime and resulted in his improved\r\noutcome. The other patient was successfully downsized to enable the Whipple procedure for curative\r\nintent. Notably, we identified one patient with SND1-BRAF kinase fusion in our case series. Germline\r\nand somatic testing were negative for BRCA1 or BRCA2 in this patient. This particular variant fusion\r\njoins SND1 exons 1-10 with BRAF exons 11-18 and maintains the reading frame. It is worth noting that\r\nthis particular configuration is the most prevalent gene fusion described in melanoma, thyroid, and\r\nlung cancers. It has also been reported in PACC[2]. This novel fusion is potentially targetable with MEK\r\ninhibitors, such as Trametinib and Cobimetinib[2,25].\r\nGermline testing and tumor sequencing results are invaluable in identifying PACC patients for\r\ntreatment regime determination and predictive biomarkers for investigational targeted therapies[14,22,\r\n23,26,27]. Newly diagnosed patients with PACC should undergo germline genetic testing and somatic\r\nprofiling where appropriate, given the high frequency of pathogenic germline BRCA alterations in\r\nPACC. This should be made available to patients regardless of clinical presentation, the pattern of\r\nmetastases, and pre-existing co-morbidities. This is also consistent with NCCN American Society of\r\nClinical Oncology guidelines which recommend all PDAC patients have upfront germline testing as\r\npart of the evolving precision strategy and screening strategies[28]. Similar to numerous studies, our\r\nLee CL et al. Institutional case series of advanced PACC\r\nWJG https://www.wjgnet.com 6429 December 7, 2022 Volume 28 Issue 45\r\npatients with pathogenic BRCA1/2 variants have an increased risk of pancreatic, ovarian, breast, and\r\nother cancers (Table 2). The lifetime risk for pancreatic cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant carriers is\r\n1% and 4.9%, respectively[29,30]. Unlike breast and ovarian cancers, germline BRCA1/2 mutations alone\r\ndo not pose a significant risk of pancreatic cancers. Recent literature review shows BRCA2 confer to 5%-\r\n17% of familial pancreatic cancers (FPC) and BRCA1 is not as highly prevalent[31-34]. Studies show that\r\ngermline susceptibility gene mutations were not found in 80% of pancreatic cancer individuals with\r\nstrong family history[31,35]. Therefore, comprehensive genome sequencing is needed to identify new\r\npossible deleterious genes associated with FPC.\r\nThere are no current clinical practice algorithms for PACC, and it is treated in the same way as\r\nPDAC. Although FOLFIRINOX represents the standard treatment with the highest efficacy in PDAC, it\r\nis not well studied in PACC[36]. Since 2010, there is a recognized OS benefit to platinum-based agents\r\ncompared to Gemcitabine or Capecitabine-based regimens, and current therapeutic approaches of\r\nmetastatic PACCs utilize more FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX. Furukawa et al[37] described a PACC patient\r\nwith a BRCA2 PV who received Cisplatin after a recurrence of liver metastasis and had a complete\r\nremission of the recurring tumor. Ploquin et al[38] reported a PACC patient with a BRCA2 PV who\r\nexperienced a 14-year complete remission following nine cycles of GEMOX, without surgical\r\nintervention. Therefore, Cisplatin and GEMOX may be alternatives in patients harboring deficiencies in\r\nDDR genes who are unfit for FOLFIRINOX.\r\nDue to accumulative neurotoxicity after 11 cycles of mFFX, our patient decided to stop systemic\r\nchemotherapy completely and de-escalated to Olaparib as a maintenance approach. The use of PARPi in\r\nPACC patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 PV/LPV is anecdotal[2,23,26]. Furthermore, the\r\nupdated analysis of the POLO trial showed a lack of OS benefit and quality of life improvement in their\r\nOlaparib-treated patients compared to the placebo arm[39]. Despite the aforementioned, we believe that\r\nmetastatic PACC patients with confirmed HRD phenotype and demonstrated strictly defined platinum\r\nsensitivity that involved exceptional response after 16 wk of chemotherapy should be considered for the\r\nbenefit of PARPi, as the case described.\r\nLike PDAC, surgery offers the best treatment approach for improved long-term survival[11,16,40].\r\nThe combination of surgical approach and perioperative chemotherapy in PACC is mainly adapted\r\nfrom the PDAC practice[40-42]. As mentioned, our patient with metastatic germline BRCA2 PV had\r\nremarkable tumor downstaging following mFFX, underwent curative surgery, and achieved a\r\npathologic near complete treatment response. Optimizing treatment approaches from this standpoint,\r\nwith growing access to germline and somatic profiling, should also be further explored in PACC.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough it is a rare disease, it is important to identify both common and rare actionable variants in\r\nPACCs. In PACC patients with BRCA variants, the maintenance treatment of PARPi after effective\r\nplatinum-based chemotherapy should be explored further. Surgical resection may provide the chance of\r\ncure after induction chemotherapy in very well-selected patients, particularly in patients with BRCA\r\nvariants. Further large-scale studies are required to verify these therapeutic strategies for PACC\r\npatients.\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\nWe acknowledged Dr. Thiago Muniz’s contribution to reviewing this manuscript for grammar and\r\nsyntax.\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\nAuthor contributions: Lee CL contributed to the data investigation, writing, and editing of the original draft; Holter S\r\nparticipated in the genomics data curation and revision of the final manuscript; Borgida A, Dodd A and Ramotar S\r\ninvolved in the data acquisition and curation; Kim TY and Khalili K participated in the radiological investigation;\r\nGrant R, Elimova E, Wasson K, Jang RW, Moore M, and Moulton CA read and approved the final manuscript;\r\nGallinger S and O’Kane GM reviewed and edited the manuscript; Knox JJ supervised the project and final\r\nmanuscript revision.\r\nInformed consent statement: Informed consent is obtained from all participants.
