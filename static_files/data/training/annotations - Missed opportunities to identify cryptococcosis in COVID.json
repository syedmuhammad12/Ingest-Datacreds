Although viral pneumonia increases the risk of invasive fungal infections, it remains\r\nunclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunomodulatory therapy, or a combination of\r\nboth are responsible for the increased recognition of opportunistic infections in COVID-19\r\npatients. Cases of cryptococcosis have previously been reported following treatment with\r\ncorticosteroids, interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, for patients\r\nwith autoimmune diseases, but their effect on the immunologic response in patients with\r\nCOVID-19 remains unknown. Herein, we present the case of a patient with COVID-19 who\r\nreceived high-dose corticosteroids and was later found to have cryptococcosis despite no\r\ntraditional risk factors. As our case and previous cases of cryptococcosis in patients with\r\nCOVID-19 demonstrate, clinicians must be suspicious of cryptococcosis in COVID-19 patients\r\nwho clinically deteriorate following treatment with immunomodulatory therapies.\r\nIntroduction\r\nSARS-CoV-2 can activate both innate and adaptive immune responses in patients ultimately leading to a dysregulated immune response.1 Due to\r\nthe widespread use of immunomodulatory therapy,\r\nincluding high-dose corticosteroids, interleukin\r\n(IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors, as well as Janus kinase\r\n(JAK) inhibitors, as part of the medical management of COVID-19,2,3 an increasing number of\r\npatients may experience an impaired immune\r\nresponse.4 Consequently, compromising host\r\nimmunity in COVID-19 patients could provide the\r\nperfect opportunity for secondary infections with or\r\nreactivation of previously latent diseases, such as\r\nlatent tuberculosis infections, strongyloidiasis,\r\naspergillosis, mucormycosis, or cryptococcosis.\r\nSpecifically, Cryptococcus neoformans is frequently\r\nassociated with advanced HIV disease manifesting\r\nas meningoencephalitis, but rates have been\r\ndecreasing among persons living with HIV (PLH)\r\ndue to increased uptake of antiretroviral therapy\r\n(ART).5 However, an increasing number of cases\r\nof cryptococcosis have been identified among new\r\npopulations of patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies, including solid organ transplant\r\n(SOT) recipients and non-HIV-infected, nontransplant patients with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, as well\r\nas those receiving immunosuppressive medications.6–10 Herein, we present the case of a patient\r\nwith COVID-19 who received immunomodulatory therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and\r\nwas later found to have cryptococcosis.\r\n\r\nPrimary source country - United States\r\nChastain DB, Henao-Martínez AF, Dykes AC, Steele GM, Stoudenmire LL, Thomas GM, et al.

His past medical history included a cerebrovascular accident resulting\r\nin left hemiplegia and hemiparesis, idiopathic\r\nperipheral autonomic neuropathy, spinal stenosis\r\nwith bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, atrial\r\nfibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,\r\ndyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, stage 3\r\nchronic kidney disease (CKD), benign prostatic\r\nhypertrophy, obesity, major depressive disorder,\r\nand vascular dementia for which he took amlodipine, aspirin, atorvastatin, dabigatran, donepezil,\r\nfamotidine, memantine, metoprolol tartrate, omeprazole, pregabalin, tamsulosin, and valproic acid.\r\nOn admission, he complained of fevers, shortness\r\nof breath, nonproductive cough, loose stools, and\r\nanorexia, but denied headache, visual disturbance,\r\nhemoptysis, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, vomiting,\r\nor rashes. His O2 saturation was 91% on room air\r\nand computed tomography (CT) of the chest\r\nrevealed multifocal infiltrates with a ground-glass\r\nappearance consistent with COVID-19. Baseline\r\nchemistry and hematology laboratory values\r\nrevealed leukopenia and lymphopenia but were\r\notherwise unremarkable and reflected his underlying CKD (Figure 1). He was provided supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and treated with\r\nceftriaxone and azithromycin for 7 days. Although\r\nhe was deemed not to be a candidate for remdesivir at that time due to CKD, he received dexamethasone for 10 days in combination with\r\nconvalescent plasma. Blood cultures and sputum\r\ncultures were collected on admission but remained\r\nsterile.\r\nOver the next 10 days, he remained afebrile, but\r\nhis respiratory function continued to deteriorate\r\non nasal cannula, and he was transitioned to nonrebreather (NRB) mask. The previously identified multifocal infiltrates persisted on follow-up\r\nchest radiography (CXR). Due to decreased O2\r\nsaturation to 70% and bluish-gray appearance,\r\nthe patient required intubation, mechanical \r\nventilation, and initiation of vasopressors, which\r\nprompted a transfer to our institution.\r\nUpon arrival, he was admitted to the intensive\r\ncare unit (ICU), where he remained sedated,\r\nmechanically ventilated, and on vasopressors. He\r\nwas subsequently started on remdesivir for 5\r\ndays, in addition to IV methylprednisolone 60 mg\r\nIV every 8 h for 2 days followed by a gradual taper\r\nthroughout his hospitalization. His initial blood\r\nand urine cultures were sterile, but multiple tracheal aspirate cultures revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Despite an unchanged\r\nCXR and successful extubation, he was started\r\non IV vancomycin on day 3, but was transitioned\r\nto linezolid after experiencing an acute kidney\r\ninjury for a combined total of 16 days.\r\nThe patient continued to improve and was transferred out of the ICU on a high-flow nasal cannula over the next 4 days, but became febrile and\r\nexperienced hypoxia, lethargy, as well as hypotension requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation with a subsequent transfer back to ICU.\r\nBlood cultures revealed yeast on Gram stain, and\r\nhe was started on micafungin. Unfortunately, the\r\npatient’s blood pressure and respiratory function\r\ncontinued to deteriorate over the next 24 h, and\r\nhe expired. Post-mortem, the previously detected\r\nyeasts grew on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar\r\n(Emmons modification) which were identified via\r\nThermo Scientific™ RapID™ Yeast Plus System\r\n(RapID; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa,\r\nKansas) as C. neoformans. Molecular identification and antifungal susceptibility testing were not\r\nperformed due to limited capabilities in the local\r\nmicrobiology laboratory. Serum cryptococcal\r\nantigen (CrAg) lateral flow assay (LFA) was also\r\nnot performed due to low suspicion of cryptococcosis in this patient and limited data describing\r\ncryptococcosis in patients with COVID-19 at the\r\ntime of this patient’s care.\r\nDiscussion\r\nThere is increasing recognition of opportunistic\r\ninfections (OIs) in COVID-19 patients with\r\nunderlying medical conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.11,12 Although the precise\r\nmechanism remains unknown, the most likely\r\npathophysiology is multifactorial involving\r\ncytokine dysregulation and impaired cell-mediated immunity due to SARS-CoV-2 combined\r\nwith receipt of immunomodulatory therapies as\r\npart of the therapeutic armamentarium for\r\nCOVID-19. The most frequently identified OIs\r\ninclude invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and\r\nmucormycosis. Clinical presentation varies\r\ndepending on organ involvement and overlap with\r\nCOVID-19, but often develops 1 to 2 weeks after\r\nhospitalization.13,14 Advanced age, chronic pulmonary disease, and treatment with antimicrobial\r\ntherapy were identified as risk factors for coronavirus disease-associated pulmonary aspergillosis\r\n(CAPA),13,15 whereas diabetes mellitus was the\r\nmost common risk factor among patients with\r\nCOVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM).14\r\nIn addition, many of these patients received\r\nimmunomodulatory therapies for COVID-19,\r\nspecifically corticosteroids and IL-6 inhibitors,\r\nwhich likely contributes to the increasing incidence of CAPA and CAM.13–15 As our case demonstrates, cryptococcosis is yet another important\r\nopportunistic pathogen that should be considered\r\nby clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19\r\nwho received immunomodulatory agents.\r\nWhile cryptococcosis primarily affects immunodeficient patients, an increasing number of cases have\r\nbeen reported in immunocompetent patients, in\r\nwhich some of these patients do not have identifiable risk factors.9 In most situations, immunocompetent hosts can eradicate C. neoformans after\r\ninhalation, but C. neoformans may survive by evading the host immune response and forming a cryptococcal granuloma or residing in phagocytic\r\ncells, thereby establishing a latent infection.16,17\r\nFollowing the development of disease state- (e.g.\r\ndiabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, etc.)6–8,10,18\r\nor medication- (e.g. corticosteroids, chemotherapy, etc.)19,20 induced immune defects in these\r\npreviously immunocompetent patients, the latent\r\nC. neoformans infection can reactivate resulting in\r\ndetectable cryptococcosis.21\r\nIndeed, eight previous cases of cryptococcosis in\r\npatients with COVID-19 have been reported\r\n(Table 1)22–29 based on a PubMed literature search\r\non 14 September 2021, using ‘Cryptococcus’ and\r\n‘COVID-19’. Of those reports, the median age\r\nwas 74 (range: 24–78) years and 80% were men.\r\nSeventy-five percent had chronic comorbidities,22,25–29 of which hypertension (83%)22,25–27,29\r\nand diabetes mellitus (33%)25,27 were most common. In addition, two patients were receiving\r\nimmunosuppressive medications: prednisone for\r\nautoimmune hemolytic anemia28 and tacrolimus in\r\ncombination with prednisone due to renal transplantation.30 Characterization of symptoms\r\ncaused by cryptococcosis was challenging due to\r\noverlap with COVID-19. However, due to low\r\nsuspicion for cryptococcosis many patients clinically deteriorated, some of which died prior to\r\ndetection of cryptococcosis.\r\nDuring hospitalization, 25% of patients received\r\ntocilizumab, and 88% received corticosteroids. In\r\nthe only case where corticosteroids were not\r\nadministered for COVID-19, diagnosis of cryptococcosis subsequently led to a new diagnosis of\r\nHIV,24 whereas C. neoformans was most commonly\r\nidentified after receiving immunomodulatory therapy in all other cases; C. neoformans was isolated\r\nfrom blood cultures in 63% (n = 5) of patients. Of\r\nthe 38% (n = 3) of patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation, C. neoformans\r\nwas detected in all CSF cultures. Overall mortality\r\nwas 63%, of which two patients died before identification of cryptococcosis.27,28\r\nIn four cases,22,23,29 including our patient, no traditional risk factors for cryptococcosis were identified.9 Notably, our patient had a glycated\r\nhemoglobin (A1C) of 5.6% (A1C ⩾ 6.5% diagnostic for diabetes),31 but did not undergo HIV\r\ntesting. While viral pneumonia increases the risk\r\nof invasive fungal infections, it remains unclear\r\nwhether SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunomodulatory therapy, or a combination of both were\r\nresponsible for increased susceptibility to acute\r\ninfection with or reactivation of C. neoformans in\r\nthese patients with COVID-19. Although much\r\nof the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis in COVID19 patients is poorly defined due to limited details\r\nin other case reports, we suspect our patient had\r\nlatent cryptococcosis which reactivated because\r\nof SARS-CoV-2 infection–induced lymphopenia\r\nand corticosteroid treatment. Blood cultures\r\nobtained on admission at the OSH were sterile.\r\nBased on a rat model of pulmonary cryptococcosis which mirrors human infection, C. neoformans\r\npersists as a granuloma within the lung despite\r\ninitial containment and no clinical symptoms.17,21\r\nFollowing receipt of corticosteroid therapy,\r\nincreased fungal burden and extrapulmonary dissemination were observed to a greater extent\r\nwhen corticosteroid therapy was administered\r\nwithin 4 weeks of initial infection with C. neoformans. However, similar findings were not\r\nobserved with late stages of latent cryptococcosis\r\nsuggesting multiple mechanisms might be\r\nnecessary for reactivation, which in this case\r\ninclude SARS-CoV-2 infection–induced lymphopenia combined with prolonged high-dose corticosteroid treatment. Mechanisms to predict and\r\nprevent reactivation of latent cryptococcosis are\r\nneeded given the increasing incidence of immunosuppressive diseases and widespread use of\r\nimmunosuppressive medications.\r\nAsymptomatic treatment-naïve PLH with CD4\r\ncell counts ⩽100 to 200 cells/µL undergo screening for cryptococcosis using serum cryptococcal\r\nantigen (CrAg) testing.32,33 Among those with\r\ndetectable CrAg, CSF should be evaluated to\r\ndetermine whether the cryptococci have disseminated to the central nervous system (CNS). Early\r\nidentification and treatment of cryptococcus in\r\nPLH with low CD4 cell counts has led to\r\ndecreased mortality attributable to cryptococcal\r\nmeningoencephalitis.34–36 Unfortunately, similar\r\nrecommendations to detect cryptococcal antigenemia and ultimately identify localized pulmonary\r\ncryptococcosis or disseminated cryptococcosis do\r\nnot exist in HIV-uninfected immunodeficient\r\npatients nor immunocompetent patients.\r\nDiagnosis of cryptococcosis in non-HIV nontransplant patients is often missed or significantly\r\ndelayed compared to PLH or organ transplant\r\nrecipients resulting in lower survival rates,37,38 as\r\nthe sensitivity of CrAg LFA to detect CrAg in\r\nserum, while still relatively high, is lower than\r\nthat in PLH.39 Unfortunately, the sensitivity of\r\nserum CrAg is unknown in COVID-19 patients\r\nwith an impaired immune response. As such, the\r\nrisk of dissemination is increased compared to\r\nimmunocompetent patients, therefore necessitating an evaluation for meningoencephalitis in\r\nCOVID-19 patients with serologic or microbiologic evidence of cryptococcosis.\r\nAn optimal treatment regimen for cryptococcosis\r\nhas not been identified in non-HIV nontransplant\r\npatients due to limited data.40,41 As a result, most\r\ntreatment regimens are based on efficacy data from\r\nPLH and SOT recipients, but depend on the extent\r\nof disease. A combination of lipid-associated formulations of amphotericin B (LFAB), such as liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) or amphotericin B\r\nlipid complex (ABLC), plus flucytosine is most\r\neffective due to rapid fungicidal activity and is considered first line for induction therapy among\r\npatients with meningoencephalitis, disseminated\r\n(e.g. involvement of two or more noncontiguous\r\nTherapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease 9\r\n8 journals.sagepub.com/home/tai\r\nsites), or severe pulmonary disease (e.g. diffuse pulmonary infiltrates). In cases of meningoencephalitis,\r\nantifungal therapy should be combined with daily\r\ntherapeutic lumbar punctures or placement of a\r\nlumbar drain or ventriculostomy to reduce intracranial pressure (ICP). Indeed, most patients who were\r\nstill alive after identification of cryptococcosis\r\nreceived an LFAB in combination with flucytosine,23–25,29 though few patients underwent CSF\r\nexamination.23,24,29\r\nWhile LFABs are preferred due to lower risk of\r\nnephrotoxicity, amphotericin b deoxycholate\r\n(AmBd) can be used if LAmB or ABLC are unavailable.42 Many resource-limited countries are\r\nunable to access flucytosine due to limited availability and prohibitive costs,43,44 requiring use of\r\nless efficacious regimens such as high dose fluconazole with or without AmBd.40,41 A prolonged\r\nduration of induction therapy of 4 weeks, or longer\r\nin the presence of neurologic complications, is\r\nrequired in non-HIV nontransplant patients. After\r\nclinical improvement with induction therapy, fluconazole 800 mg per day should be initiated as\r\nconsolidation therapy for at least 8 weeks followed\r\nby 200 to 400 mg per day as maintenance therapy\r\nfor at least 1 year. However, the duration of antifungal therapy is somewhat dependent on resolution of the underlying immunodeficiency allowing\r\nfor gradual restoration of immune function.\r\nConclusion\r\nCases of cryptococcosis have previously been\r\nreported following short- or long-term initiation of\r\ncorticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors\r\nfor patients with autoimmune diseases, but it\r\nremains unknown how the use of one or a combination of these therapies will directly or indirectly\r\nalter immunologic response in patients with\r\nCOVID-19. Clinicians must be suspicious of cryptococcosis in COVID-19 patients who clinically\r\ndeteriorate following treatment with immunomodulatory therapies as signs and symptoms of cryptococcosis may overlap with COVID-19. Given the\r\nutility of CrAg LFA to detect CrAg in serum coupled with the high rate of missed opportunities to\r\nidentify cryptococcosis and dire outcomes in nonHIV nontransplant patients, early recognition,\r\nperhaps through the use of a CrAg screen-andtreat strategy, prior to administration of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19 patients\r\nwill result in prompt administration of antifungal\r\ntherapy, most often a combination of LFAB plus\r\nflucytosine, thereby halting or eliminating further\r\ndissemination and improve overall mortality.\r\nAuthor contributions\r\nDaniel B.
