In addition to the\r\nantidepressant effect of venlafaxine, it also\r\nrelieves nonorganic physical pain.1 D-dimer\r\nis a soluble fibrin degradation product that\r\nresults from ordered breakdown of thrombi\r\nby the fibrinolytic system, and D-dimer serves\r\nas a valuable marker of activation of coagulation\r\nand fibrinolysis.2 Serum D-dimer testing\r\ncan help diagnose deep vein thrombosis\r\n(DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).3 It\r\nwas reported that tricyclic antidepressants\r\ncan cause DVTor PE.We here report a patient\r\nwith D-dimer elevation and asymptomatic vascular\r\ndisease after venlafaxine administration.\r\nWe reported the patient was a married\r\nand retired 71-year-oldwoman. Height 163 cm,\r\nweight 62 kg, body mass index 23.3 kg/m2.\r\nShewascomplaining of sadness for 2months,\r\nwhich had been aggravated in the past 2 days.\r\nVenlafaxine 150 mg/d had been administered\r\nat 8:00 A.M. She denied a history of any serious\r\norganic diseases. Her vital signs were\r\nstable, and the overall physical examination\r\nwas normal. Venlafaxine had been continued\r\nto improve the depressive mood. Emergency\r\nblood testswere performed, including hematology,\r\nC-reactive protein test, serum biochemical\r\ntest, and functional blood coagulation\r\nand D-dimer test. Myocardial enzymes,\r\nincluding cTnI test, were also assessed, and\r\nno significant abnormalities were found, except\r\nfor a D-dimer level of 1190.0 μg/L,\r\nblood platelet (PLT) level of 218 \u0001 109/L,\r\nprothrombin time (PT) of 10.5 seconds, activated\r\npartial thromboplastin time (APTT) of\r\n24.1 seconds, and fibrinogen (FIB) level\r\nof 2.57 g/L.\r\nThree days after admission, an arterial\r\nand venous color Doppler ultrasonography\r\nwas performed, showing multiple small plaques\r\nin both lower limb arteries. Venlafaxine dosage\r\nwas increased to 225 mg/d and functional\r\nblood coagulation and D-dimer tests\r\nwere assessed 1 week later and showed a\r\nPLTlevel of 225\u0001109/L, PTof 10.8 seconds,\r\nAPTTof 24.3 seconds, FIB level of 2.69 g/L,\r\nand D-dimer of 7890.0 μg/L. These testswere\r\nrepeated the next day and showed a PLT level\r\nof 220 \u0001 109/L, PTof 10.8 seconds, APTT\r\nof 23.3 seconds, FIB level of 2.43 g/L, and\r\nD-dimer of 8490.0 μg/L. The patient developed\r\noccasional pain and swelling of the left\r\nlower limb, and the emergency arterial and\r\nvenous color Doppler ultrasonography indicated\r\nmultiple small plaques in both\r\nlower limb arteries, with normal blood flow\r\nin the deep veins of both lower limbs, and a\r\nthrombosis in the medial great saphenous\r\nvein of left thigh. Enoxaparin sodiuminjection\r\n4000 IU every 12 hours was immediately\r\nadministrated for anticoagulation therapy.\r\nThe next day, an enhanced pulmonary\r\nCTangiography scan was performed, showing\r\nno obvious abnormalities. The final diagnosis\r\nis single episode depressive disorder\r\n(Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 35).\r\nThe patient underwent surgerywas scheduled\r\nto repair the varicosis of the great saphenous\r\nvein in the left lower limb 3 days later.\r\nOne month later, the patient presented\r\nto the clinical psychology clinic for a routine\r\nfollow-up examination. Functional blood coagulation\r\nand D-dimer tests showed a PLT\r\nlevel of 228 \u0001 109/L, a PTof 10.5 seconds,\r\nAPTTof 23.8 seconds, FIB level of 2.39 g/L,\r\nand D-dimer of 3490 μg/L. A week after\r\nvenlafaxine was discontinued, a telephone\r\nfollow-up indicated that the D-dimer had\r\ndecreased, functional blood coagulation and\r\nD-dimer tests showed a PLT level of 231 \u0001\r\n109/L, a PT of 10.4 seconds, APTT of\r\n23.3 seconds, FIB level of 2.65 g/L, and\r\nD-dimer of 1110.0 μg/L. One month later,\r\ncoagulation function, functional blood coagulation,\r\nand D-dimer testswere performed again\r\nand showed a PLT level of 239\u0001 109/L, a PT\r\nof 11.1 seconds, APTT of 24.3 seconds, FIB\r\nlevel of 2.61 g/L, and D-dimer of 6150.0 μg/L\r\nas the patient resumed venlafaxine aweek ago.\r\nThe patient was advised to stop venlafaxine\r\nimmediately. Aweek later, the D-dimer level\r\nwas decreased and showed a PLT level of\r\n223 \u0001 109/L, a PT of 10.3 seconds, APTT\r\nof 23.8 seconds, FIB level of 2.46 g/L, and\r\nD-dimer of 650.0 μg/L.\r\nWe received written publication consent\r\nfrom the subject for publication of this\r\ncase report. Institutional review and ethics\r\nboards consent for research was obtained.\r\nChronic diseases such as depression\r\nand anxiety are major killers in the modern\r\nera. Physical inactivity is a primary cause\r\nof most chronic diseases.4 Depression in elderly\r\npeople is considered a risk factor for\r\nvenous thromboembolism (VTE).5 The main\r\nsymptoms of depression include psychomotor\r\ninhibition resulting in significantly prolonged\r\nsleeping described in the “Diagnostic\r\nand StatisticalManual ofMental Disorders,”\r\nwhich could be an important risk factor for\r\nvenous embolism. Lederbogen et al6 conclude\r\nthat major depression is associated\r\nwith increased platelet aggregability, which\r\nseems to persist even under a marked improvement\r\nin depressive symptom. In a study\r\nby Hoirisch-Clapauch et al,7 tissue plasminogen\r\nactivator and plasminogen activator\r\ninhibitor 1 imbalance may play an important\r\nrole in pathophysiology of mental and\r\nthromboembolic disorders. Tissue plasminogen\r\nactivator facilitates clot dissolution and\r\nparticipates in several brain functions, including\r\nresponse to stress, learning, and memory.7\r\nParkin et al8 showed that women with antidepressant\r\nuse had a significantly higher\r\nrisk of VTE than women who reported neither\r\ndepression nor use of psychotropic\r\ndrugs. Venous thromboembolism risk was\r\nnot significantly increased in women who\r\nwere treated for depression or anxiety, without\r\nuse of antidepressants or other psychotropic\r\ndrugs. A few studies have shown that\r\nmany depressive patients on long-term antidepressants\r\nhad elevated D-dimer levelswith\r\nasymptomatic venous embolisms.9 At present,\r\nthe pathogenesis underlying antidepressantinduced\r\nDVT or PE is unclear, Öhlinger\r\net al10 found that TMEM16F inhibitors tannic\r\nacid and epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibit\r\nlipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid–\r\ninduced phosphatidylserine exposure and\r\ncalcium uptake at low micromolar concentrations;\r\nfluoxetine, an antidepressant and a\r\nknown activator of TMEM16F, enhances\r\nthese processes. Erythrocytes actively modulate\r\nblood clotting and thrombus formation.10\r\nIn addition, doxepin is a powerful inhibitor of\r\ncollagen receptor glycoprotein VI-dependent\r\nplatelet Ca2+ signaling, platelet activation,\r\nand thrombus formation.11 Most recent studies\r\nhave examined DVTor PE caused by antipsychotic\r\ndrugs,12 such as clozapine.13 To\r\nour knowledge, no studies on D-dimer elevations,\r\nDVT, or PE caused by dual-receptor\r\nantidepressants have been reported.Medications\r\nand D-dimer changes in the patient are\r\nshown in Figure 1.\r\nWe used the Naranjo Scale to assess\r\nthe relationship between the possible adverse\r\nevent and venlafaxine. There were\r\nno previous conclusive reports on this adverse\r\nreaction. This case report described\r\nthe possible adverse event associated with\r\nD-dimer elevations after administration of\r\nvenlafaxine in patients with depression.\r\nIn addition, this adverse event improved\r\nwhen venlafaxine was discontinued. When\r\nvenlafaxine was readministered, D-dimer\r\nelevations again. The patient has never taken\r\nantidepressants or antipsychotics before.\r\nThe patient was not taking other antidepressants\r\nafter discontinuing venlafaxine\r\nduring the illness. There are many reasons\r\nfor the increase of D-dimer, such as sepsis,\r\nmalignancy, trauma, cerebrovascular accident,\r\nand so on.14 In addition, being overweight,\r\naging, and depression can also lead to elevated\r\nD-dimer. In this case report, the patient\r\nwas an elderly depression patient with\r\na BMI in the normal range, among which\r\nJournal of Clinical Psychopharmacology • Volume 42, Number 5, September/October 2022 Letters to the Editors\r\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

According to a\r\nstudy by Naranjo et al,15 the patient’s ADR\r\nscore was 5. (The ADR was assigned to a\r\nprobability category from the total score as\r\nfollows: definite ≥9, probable 5–8, possible\r\n1–4, doubtful ≤015). Thus, we think that\r\nDVT or PE should be ruled out initially in\r\npatients taking long-term venlafaxine for\r\nmild depressive symptoms. Functional blood\r\ncoagulation and D-dimer tests, as well as venous\r\ncolor Doppler ultrasonography, and enhanced\r\npulmonary CT angiography should\r\nbe routinely performed, whether in an outpatient\r\nor inpatient setting, to enhance the early\r\ndetection and treatment of vascular disorders\r\nin patients taking venlafaxine for depression.\r\nAUTHOR DISCLOSURE\r\nINFORMATION\r\nThe authors declare no conflicts\r\nof interest.\r\nThis is an open-access article distributed\r\nunder the terms of the Creative\r\nCommons Attribution-Non Commercial-No\r\nDerivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND),\r\nwhere it is permissible to download and\r\nshare the work provided it is properly cited.\r\nThe work cannot be changed in any way or\r\nused commercially without permission from\r\nthe journal.\r\nARTICLE INFORMATION\r\nReceived March 25, 2022; accepted after\r\nrevision June 10, 2022.\r\nDOI: 10.1097/JCP.0000000000001598\r\nZhi-Han Gao, MM\r\nChun-Xiao Dai, MM\r\nJian Xie, MM\r\nDepartment of Clinical Psychology\r\nPsychiatry Unit\r\nAffiliated Hangzhou First People’s Hospital\r\nZhejiang University School of Medicine\r\nHangzhou, China\r\n574892686@qq.com\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

In this case report, the patient\r\nwas an elderly depression patient with\r\na BMI in the normal range, among which\r\nJournal of Clinical Psychopharmacology • Volume 42, Number 5, September/October 2022 Letters to the Editors\r\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

According to a\r\nstudy by Naranjo et al,15 the patient’s ADR\r\nscore was 5. (The ADR was assigned to a\r\nprobability category from the total score as\r\nfollows: definite ≥9, probable 5–8, possible\r\n1–4, doubtful ≤015). Thus, we think that\r\nDVT or PE should be ruled out initially in\r\npatients taking long-term venlafaxine for\r\nmild depressive symptoms. Functional blood\r\ncoagulation and D-dimer tests, as well as venous\r\ncolor Doppler ultrasonography, and enhanced\r\npulmonary CT angiography should\r\nbe routinely performed, whether in an outpatient\r\nor inpatient setting, to enhance the early\r\ndetection and treatment of vascular disorders\r\nin patients taking venlafaxine for depression.\r\nAUTHOR DISCLOSURE\r\nINFORMATION\r\nThe authors declare no conflicts\r\nof interest.\r\nThis is an open-access article distributed\r\nunder the terms of the Creative\r\nCommons Attribution-Non Commercial-No\r\nDerivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND),\r\nwhere it is permissible to download and\r\nshare the work provided it is properly cited.\r\nThe work cannot be changed in any way or\r\nused commercially without permission from\r\nthe journal.\r\nARTICLE INFORMATION\r\nReceived March 25, 2022; accepted after\r\nrevision June 10, 2022.\r\nDOI: 10.1097/JCP.0000000000001598\r\nZhi-Han Gao, MM\r\nChun-Xiao Dai, MM\r\nJian Xie, MM\r\nDepartment of Clinical Psychology\r\nPsychiatry Unit\r\nAffiliated Hangzhou First People’s Hospital\r\nZhejiang University School of Medicine\r\nHangzhou, China\r\n574892686@qq.com\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.
