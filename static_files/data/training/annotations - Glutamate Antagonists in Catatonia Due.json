The glutamate NMDAR antagonists\r\namantadine and memantine are effective in catatonia (Beach, 2017), but data on their\r\nuse in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is limited. We describe three patients with catatonia\r\ndue to anti-NMDAR encephalitis treated with NMDAR antagonists and propose a\r\npossible mechanism underlying differential outcomes. Case 1: A 20-year-old woman\r\npresented with catatonic symptoms after successful treatment of anti-NMDAR\r\nencephalitis with immunotherapy and salpingo-oopherectomy for ovarian teratoma.\r\nInitial Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) score was 22. Lorazepam 2.5 mg\r\nthree times daily was partially effective, but increased doses caused sedation.\r\nMemantine was titrated to 10 mg twice daily with complete resolution of catatonia over\r\ntwo weeks. Case 2: A 26-year-old woman presented with catatonic with BFCRS score\r\nof 25, after successful immunotherapy for anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Lorazepam 2 mg\r\nfour times daily was partially effective, but further increase caused respiratory\r\ndepression. Memantine 10 mg daily resulted in further improvement. Lorazepam\r\ntitration to 4 mg four times daily was then possible, with complete resolution of catatonia\r\nover two weeks. Case 3: A 31-year-old woman with anti-NMDAR encephalitis presented\r\nwith catatonic symptoms with BFCRS score of 22, after a hospital course significant for\r\nlimited response to immunotherapy with persistently elevated serum anti-NMDAR\r\nantibody titers. Lorazepam 2 mg three times daily was partially effective, but further\r\nincrease caused sedation. Both amantadine 100 mg twice daily and memantine 10 mg\r\nwere trialed but were discontinued due to agitation. Mutism and negativism persisted,\r\nwith a discharge BFCRS score of 12. Discussion: Memantine was effective for catatonia\r\nand well tolerated in two patients with successfully treated anti-NMDAR encephalitis,\r\nbut both amantadine and memantine caused agitation in a third patient with active\r\ndisease. NMDARs are reversibly internalized in the presence of anti-NMDAR\r\nantibodies, leading to a compensatory increase in downstream glutamatergic tone. We\r\nhypothesize that NMDAR reemergence after successful treatment, in the context of\r\nexcess extracellular glutamate, creates a state of excitotoxicity contributing to catatonic\r\nsigns for which NMDAR blockade can be effective. In the third case, where NMDARs\r\npresumably remained internalized in the presence of persistent anti-NMDAR antibodies\r\nand a state of NMDAR hypofunction persisted, further NMDAR blockade caused clinical\r\nworsening. Conclusion/Implications: NMDAR antagonists can be safe and effective in\r\npatients with residual catatonia following successful treatment of anti-NMDAR\r\nencephalitis but may be less useful during active disease. More work is needed to\r\nclarify best practices for patients with catatonia due to anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\r\nReferences: 1. Espinola-Nadurille M, Flores-Rivera J, Rivas-Alonso V, et al.
