Only 23 cases of PCNS ENK/TCL have been\r\nreported in the English literature. Due to the rarity of this lymphoma, an effective therapeutic\r\nstrategy has not been defined. Generally, this type of lymphoma is treated with surgery,\r\nintrathecal chemotherapy, and postoperative chemoradiation therapy. The prognosis is poor.\r\nHerein, we present a case of primary brain NK/T cell lymphoma in a 50-year-old immuno­\r\ncompetent Chinese female and review the literature. The patient underwent intracranial\r\ntumor resection and was subsequently treated with a PD1 monoclonal antibody\r\n(Sintilimab) combined with chemotherapy. The patient survived 15 months after diagnosis.\r\nThis is the first report of PCNS ENK/TCL treated with surgery and chemotherapy combined\r\nwith immunotherapy and suggests an effective treatment regimen for PCNS ENK/TCL.\r\nKeywords: primary central nervous system, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma,\r\nchemotherapy, immunotherapy, PD1\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nPrimary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSLs) are aggressive non-Hodgkin\r\nextranodal lymphoma that originate from the brain parenchyma, meninges, spinal\r\ncord, or eyes excluding systemic disease; It represents 4% to 6% of all extranodal\r\nlymphomas and only 4% of all intracranial neoplasms.1,2 Among primary CNS\r\nlymphomas, more than 90% of PCNSLs are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in\r\nimmunocompetent patients,3 and less than 5% are T-cell lymphoma.2 Extranodal\r\nNatural Killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENK/TCL) originates from NK cells or cytotoxic\r\nT cells and is an aggressive lymphoma. ENK/TCL is usually related to Epstein-Barr\r\nvirus (EBV) infection and is characterized by a cytotoxic phenotype, vascular\r\ndamage, and prominent necrosis.4 ENK/TCL is more commonly in Asia and\r\nSouth America. Lesions occur mostly in the nasal cavity and the midline structure\r\nof the face. It was previously known as lethal midline granuloma.5 However, it can\r\nalso occur in the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin, soft tissue, and\r\ntestes.4 Conversely, the central nervous system is rarely involved as the initial site\r\nfor ENK/TCL lesions. Extranodal NK/TCL of the primary central nervous system\r\n(PCNS) is extremely rare.

The patient also had\r\na history of cholecystectomy and right breast cyst surgery.\r\nThere was no other relevant family and personal medical\r\nhistory. Physical examination revealed that the patient was\r\nconscious, spoke clearly, with the tongue in the middle\r\nposition. The bilateral frontal lines and the nasolabial\r\ngroove were symmetrical. The bilateral pupils were\r\nequally large and round, with a diameter of 3 mm. The\r\npatient’s left and right visual acuity was 1.0 and 0.1,\r\nrespectively. The intraocular pressure on both sides was\r\n16 mmHg. There was no evidence of lymphadenopathy or\r\nhepatosplenomegaly. A magnetic resonance imaging\r\n(MRI) scan was performed that revealed a mass located\r\nin the left frontal lobe with a large cross section of\r\n4.3×3.2 cm (Figure 1A–F). The lesion exhibited slightly\r\nlonger T1 and slightly longer T2 signals, with internal\r\ndensity that was not uniform (Figure 1A–F). Due to the\r\nmass effect, the midline structure and the left ventricle\r\nwere compressed and shifted to the right (Figure 1C).\r\nThe MRI revealed that the upper margin of the intracranial\r\nsegment of the left optic nerve was closely associated with\r\nthe intracranial tumor, while no obvious abnormality was\r\nobserved in the right optic nerve (Figure 1D). Magnetic\r\nresonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain showed an\r\nincreased\r\ncholine\r\npeak\r\nand\r\na\r\nsuppressed\r\nN-acetylaspartate peak (Figure 2). The patient underwent\r\nintracranial tumor resection. The tumor was yellowishwhite in color, hard in texture, without capsule, and had\r\na rich in blood supply, with significant surrounding edema.\r\nThe histological examination revealed that the brain par­\r\nenchyma was diffusely infiltrated by atypical lymphocytes\r\nand showed extensive necrosis (Figure 3A). The tumor\r\ncells were of medium size with irregularly folded nuclei\r\nand indistinct nucleoli. The cytoplasm was moderate and\r\nmitotic figures were easily identified (Figure 3B). The\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\r\n\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S343400\r\n\r\nDovePress\r\n\r\ntumor cells presented an angiocentric (Figure 3C) and\r\nangiodestructive growth pattern (Figure 3D). The\r\nEnVision method was applied for immunohistochemical\r\nstaining,25 and revealed that the tumor cells were positive\r\nfor CD3 (Figure 3E), CD4 (Figure 3F), CD7, and CD8.\r\nThe NK cell marker CD56 was partially positive\r\n(Figure 3G). PD1 was weakly positive (Figure 3M) and\r\nPD-L1 was positive (Figure 3N); however, B cell markers,\r\nincluding CD20 (Figure 3H) and CD79a, were negative. In\r\naddition, cytotoxic markers such as granzyme\r\nB (Figure 3I) and TIA-1 (Figure 3J) were also positive\r\nfor tumor cells. The Ki-67 proliferation index was positive\r\nin about 80% of tumor cells (Figure 3K). Additionally,\r\ntumor cells were positive for Vim, LCA, and negative for\r\nCD30, CK, S100, Syn, GFAP, olig-2, ALKp80, and EMA.\r\nSmall RNAs encoded by EBV (EBERs) were detected by\r\nin situ hybridization (ISH) in the nucleus of lymphoma\r\ncells (Figure 3L). Through histopathological analysis, the\r\ndiagnosis of ENK/TCL was established. Subsequent\r\nlaboratory tests revealed that platelets, hemoglobin level,\r\nand white blood cell count were all within the reference\r\nrange. The results of the blood biochemical examination\r\nwere normal. Syphilis serologies, hepatitis C virus, and\r\nhepatitis B virus were all negative. The patient was immu­\r\nnocompetent and HIV negative. The erythrocyte sedimen­\r\ntation rate (ESR) was elevated at 82 mm/hour (normal\r\nrange 0–20 mm/hour). Quantitative polymerase chain\r\nreaction (qPCR) analysis was positive for EBV DNA\r\n(5.96×102 copies/mL) in peripheral blood. The lympho­\r\ncyte subsets showed a decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio\r\nand B lymphocytes (CD3-CD19+). Cerebrospinal fluid\r\n(CSF) analysis showed an elevated white blood cell\r\ncount (53×106/L, normal range 0–5×106/L), with pleocy­\r\ntosis (54×106/L, normal range 0–8×106/L) and slightly\r\nelevated protein (628.6 mg/L, normal range 150–450 mg/\r\nL). The CSF cytologic examination was negative for neo­\r\nplastic cells, and flow cytometry immunophenotyping ana­\r\nlysis was normal. The real-time qPCR analysis of the CSF\r\nwas negative for EBV DNA. A bone marrow biopsy, bone\r\nmarrow smear, and bone marrow flow cytometry immu­\r\nnophenotyping analysis was negative for lymphomatous\r\ninvolvement. The whole-body positron emission photogra­\r\nphy/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan revealed that\r\nthe left frontal lobe foci showed postoperative changes\r\nwith sparse fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, but no foci of\r\nincreased uptake elsewhere in the body (Figure 4).\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan after surgery\r\nand before chemotherapy revealed a residual cavity was\r\n\r\nOncoTargets and Therapy 2022:15\r\n\r\n\fDovepress\r\n\r\nQin et al\r\n\r\nFigure 1 MRI images of the patient.

No\r\nabnormal signal areas and abnormal enhancement foci\r\nwere observed in other brain parenchyma (Figure 1G–J).\r\nFrom the combined radiological and clinicopathological\r\nanalysis, the patient was diagnosed with PCNS ENK/\r\nTCL. The patient underwent six cycles of PD1 monoclonal\r\nantibody (Sintilimab) and high-dose methotrexate and\r\npegaspargase and thiotepa chemotherapy regimen\r\n(Sintilimab 200 mg, methotrexate 3.5 g/m2, pegaspargase\r\n2000 IU/m2, thiotepa 30 mg/m2) plus an intrathecal meth­\r\notrexate (15 mg) and cytarabine (50 mg) and dexametha­\r\nsone (5 mg) in the first two cycles. After treatment, her\r\nright eye visual acuity recovered. The subsequent MRI\r\nobtained 8 months later revealed the extent of abnormal\r\nenhancement foci and the residual cavity in the left frontal\r\nlobe was smaller than before (Figure 1K–N).

The main adverse events during treatment\r\nwere hematologic toxicity: grade 1 neutropenia, grade 3\r\nanemia, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The efficacy was\r\nevaluated as complete response and the patient remained\r\nalive 15 months after her diagnosis. For subsequent treat­\r\nment, we planned to use Sintilimab as maintenance ther­\r\napy, but the patient refused further treatment.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nPCNSL is confined to the brain parenchyma, eyes, spinal\r\ncord, or meninges, with no evidence of systemic involve­\r\nment at the time of diagnosis. PCNSL is a specific form of\r\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma and represents 4% to 6% of all\r\nextranodal lymphomas,26 and only 4% of all intracranial\r\nneoplasms.2 Among primary CNS lymphomas, more than\r\n90% are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).3 PCNS\r\nENK/TCL is distinctly rare, with only 23 cases reported in\r\nthe English literature so far. Among these cases, aggres­\r\nsive clinical behavior and a rapid progressive clinical\r\ncourse were reported, and patients have a poorer prognosis\r\n\r\n\r\nthan extracranial NK/TCL.6–24 PCNSLs are often accom­\r\npanied by nonspecific clinical symptoms such as dizziness,\r\nheadache, vomiting, and blurred vision. Our patient pre­\r\nsented with loss of visual acuity and weakness of the\r\nlimbs, which were consistent with the nonspecific symp­\r\ntoms of primary CNS lymphoma. Morphologically, NK/\r\nTCL shows obvious necrosis and angiodestructive growth\r\npattern, and there was diffuse lymphocyte infiltration. The\r\nmorphology of tumor cells varies greatly. The typical\r\nimmunophenotype of NK/TCL is cytoplasmic CD3+,\r\nCD56+, EBER+, and cytotoxic markers (perforin, gran­\r\nzyme B, and TIA-1) are positive.27 Recently, research\r\nshowed that most NK/T cell lymphoma were from the\r\nT cell lineage, and half lacked expression of TCR\r\n\r\n\r\nprotein.28 The rearrangement of the TCR gene is an impor­\r\ntant diagnostic molecular marker for this lymphoma.\r\nWe report a case of PCNS ENK/TCL in a 50-year-old\r\nimmunocompetent Chinese female. To our knowledge, this is\r\nthe first case of this tumor treated with an immune checkpoint\r\ninhibitor. Furthermore, we checked the protein expression of\r\nprogrammed cell death 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death\r\nligand 1 (PD-L1) by immunohistochemistry (Figure 3M and\r\nN).

According to previously reported cases,\r\noverall survival in patients with PCNS ENK/TCL is not\r\nhigh. The highest survival reported was 139 months to\r\ndate, and the median overall survival was 6 months.6–24\r\nThere were nineteen immunocompetent (IC) cases and two\r\nimmunosuppressive (IS) cases of which one was infected\r\nwith HIV and the another was a posttransplant patient.\r\nMost of the patients were from Asia, Africa, and Spain,\r\nand the age of these patients was between 13 and 77 years\r\n(median, 53 years). There were 13 males and 10 females,\r\nand the male-to-female ratio was 1.3:1. In terms of IC\r\ncases, age ranged between 13 and 77 years (median, 54\r\nyears), with 10 males and 9 females. The lesions of all\r\nreported cases were restricted to the CNS; however, the\r\ntumor was broadly distributed throughout the CNS, includ­\r\ning the brain parenchyma, orbital, meninges, spinal cord\r\nand pituitary gland, cauda equina, indicating that there was\r\nno predilection site. The locations of previously reported\r\ncases of PCNS ENK/TCL are summarized in Table 1.\r\nMost cases were diagnosed by surgical resection, includ­\r\ning the case reported herein. Among all reported cases,\r\ntreatment information was available for eighteen patients.\r\nAll these patients received different treatments: seven\r\nunderwent surgical excision, twelve underwent MTX che­\r\nmotherapy, and twelve received radiotherapy. Although\r\nmost cases received combination treatment, some patients\r\nreceived radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone, while none\r\nof the patients received surgical intervention alone.\r\nHowever, the case we reported was treated with surgical\r\nexcision, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. For all\r\npatients, the prognosis was poor as shown in Table 1,\r\nwith the overall survival of the IC cases being 1–29\r\nmonths (median, 7 months). Histologically, they showed\r\nvascular damage and necrosis accompanied by vascularcentered infiltration. Expression of various markers\r\nincluded CD3 (20/21); CD56 (15/20); CD5 (1/8); CD45\r\n(6/6); cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1/granzyme B/perforin)\r\n(12/12), and EBER (18/18). T cell clonality was detected\r\nin 42% (5/12) of the cases examined. Some of the included\r\ncases revealed that the majority of NK/T-cell lymphoma\r\nwere of the T-cell lineage, and half lacked TCR protein\r\nexpression.28 In our case, immunohistochemical staining\r\nshowed the tumor cells were positive for CD3, CD4, TIA1, granzyme B, CD56 and were negative for CD20. In\r\naddition, PD1 was weakly positive and PD-L1 was\r\n\r\nOncoTargets and Therapy 2022:15\r\n\r\nQin et al\r\n\r\npositive. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) were\r\ndetected in the nucleus of lymphoma cells. However,\r\nT-cell clonality was not evaluated in our case.\r\nDue to the rarity of this lymphoma, an effective ther­\r\napeutic strategy has not been established. Generally, this\r\nlymphoma is treated by surgery, intrathecal chemotherapy,\r\nand postoperative chemoradiation therapy. Currently, the\r\nstandardized therapeutic strategy for CNS lymphoma\r\nincludes radiation therapy and high-dose MTX.29 The use\r\nof whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in PCNSL treat­\r\nment is controversial, especially in patients over 60 years\r\nof age, due to its limited efficacy and late-onset\r\nneurotoxicity.1 In our case, the patient underwent surgical\r\nexcision and was received six cycles of PD1 monoclonal\r\nantibody (Sintilimab), high-dose methotrexate, pegaspar­\r\ngase, thiotepa chemotherapy regimen plus intrathecal che­\r\nmotherapy. The patient tolerated the treatment well and\r\ncontinued to show radiographical and clinical improve­\r\nments, although her outcome is not known. Considering\r\nthe patient’s good response to chemotherapy and the\r\ndelayed neurotoxicity of WBRT, WBRT was not consid­\r\nered. Due to the short survival period of standard treatment\r\nand the highly aggressive course of this tumor, some clin­\r\nicians recommend bone marrow or peripheral stem cell\r\ntransplantation to consolidate.29 Nonetheless, there are no\r\nreliable data for NK/T-cell lymphoma, and this treatment\r\nstrategy is usually used for the treatment of B-cell lym­\r\nphoma. Due to the difficulty in performing clinical trials\r\nfor PCNS ENK/T-cell lymphoma, there is still a lack of\r\nstandardized treatments. Some studies have reported the\r\noverexpression of the PD-L1 protein in ENK/TCL by\r\nimmunohistochemistry,30–32 and refractory NK/T-cell lym­\r\nphoma with PD-L1 overexpression was sensitive to antiPD1 antibody treatment.33 One possible mechanism for\r\nNK/T-cell lymphoma to escape effector T cell immune\r\ntargeting is to suppress antitumor immunity by PD1 liga­\r\ntion with PD-L1. Blocking the PD1/PD-L1 signaling path­\r\nway with anti-PD1 antibody can restore effector T cells\r\ntargeting NK/T-cell lymphoma cells, which is a potential\r\ntherapeutic strategy. A study carried out in Asian countries\r\nthat included seven patients who were refractory or\r\nrelapsed after the SMILE chemotherapy regimen under­\r\nwent a median of seven cycles of a single agent, pembro­\r\nlizumab (an anti-PD-L1 antibody), and reported that two\r\npatients achieved a partial response (PR), and five patients\r\nachieved a complete response (CR). The objective\r\nresponse rate (ORR) was 100%.33 Two independent studies\r\ndemonstrated that three patients with refractory or relapsed\r\n\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/OTT.S343400\r\n\r\nDovePress\r\n\r\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\fDovepress\r\n\r\nQin et al\r\n\r\nENK/TCL achieved a CR after therapy with\r\npembrolizumab.34,35 Another study reported that three\r\ncases with refractory or relapsed ENK/TCL achieved\r\na clinical response with low-dose nivolumab (an anti-PD\r\n-1 antibody).36 A pilot study showed that nivolumab\r\nachieved objective clinical and radiographic responses in\r\nfour patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL and one sec­\r\nondary CNS lymphoma, including four CR and one PR.37\r\nThese results indicated that anti-PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal\r\nantibody may be an effective treatment for PCNS ENK/\r\nTCL. In our case, we verified the expression of PD1 and\r\nPD-L1 and revealed that PD1 was weakly positive\r\n(Figure 3M) and PD-L1 was positive (Figure 3N).\r\nTherefore, for this patient, we chose a chemotherapy regi­\r\nmen containing the PD1 monoclonal antibody (Sintilimab).\r\nOur patient’s good outcome may also be attributed to the\r\nreduction of the tumor mass by resection before high-dose\r\nMTX, which may have enhanced the antitumor efficacy of\r\nMTX, while the surgical disruption of the blood-brain\r\nbarrier may have resulting in increasing doses of drug\r\nentering the brain. However, our case report still has cer­\r\ntain limitations due to the lack of molecular profiling,\r\nwhich may be important to determine responses to PD-1\r\nimmunotherapy in NK/TCL.38\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe report a new case of PCNS ENK/TCL in a 50-year-old\r\nimmunocompetent Chinese female, and summarized the\r\nclinicopathological features of previously reported cases.\r\nAlthough most of primary CNS lymphoma are B-cell\r\nlymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma also do occur.\r\nTherefore, NK/T-cell lymphoma should be included in\r\nthe differential diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma, and\r\nexcluding direct invasion of extracranial NK/T-cell lym­\r\nphoma. Surgery and chemotherapy combined with immu­\r\nnotherapy may be an effective strategy for the treatment of\r\nPCNS ENK/TCL. Further studies are needed to verify the\r\nefficacy and safety of this treatment strategy.\r\n\r\nEthics and Consent Statement\r\nWritten informed consent has been provided by the patient\r\nto have the case details and any accompanied images\r\npublished.
