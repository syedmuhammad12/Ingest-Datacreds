There are the reports of\r\nfungal, bacterial, and viral co-infections\r\nwith SARS-CoV-\r\n2.\r\nWe report the unusual\r\ncase of concomitant aspergillosis, mucormycosis, cytomegalovirus pneumonia,\r\nand also klebsiella pneumoniae empyema as the complication of SARS-CoV-\r\n2.\r\nKEYWORDS\r\naspergillosis, CMV, co-infection,\r\nCOVID-19,\r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, mixed infection,\r\nmucormycosis\r\n2 of 5 | POURABDOLLAH TOUTKABONI et al.\r\n2 | CASE PRESENTATION\r\nA 68-year-\r\nold\r\ndiabetic man was presented to the emergency\r\ndepartment with a 5-day\r\nhistory of fever (38.7°C),\r\ndry cough, and dyspnea (SpO2 was 90%—room\r\nair). He\r\nwas on the oral hypoglycemic agent (metformin 500 mg\r\nevery 12 h) for several years. Laboratory studies showed\r\nelevated C-reactive\r\nprotein (120 mg/dl), and reverse transcription\r\npolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\r\nconfirmed\r\nSARS-CoV-\r\n2\r\ndiagnosis. A high-resolution\r\nchest CT scan\r\nobtained at admission was consistent with COVID-19\r\npneumonia. The patient received remdesivir and dexamethasone\r\nand was discharged after 9 days with the\r\nimprovement of signs and symptoms. After 12 days, the\r\npatient was re-admitted\r\nbecause of severe dyspnea and\r\nfever. Chest CT scan revealed left-sided\r\npleural effusion,\r\nand the chest tube was inserted and discharged after\r\n7 days with the improvement of dyspnea. After 10 days,\r\nthe patient was referred to our center for the first time because\r\nof malaise, fever, chills, and purulent discharge at\r\nthe previous chest tube excite site.\r\nAt admission, the patient was febrile, and the vital\r\nsigns were as follows: PR: 110 beats/min, RR: 25 breath/\r\nmin, T: 38.5, and BP: 120/90 mmHg. The initial laboratory\r\ndata were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC): 4900/\r\nmm3 (neutrophils: 83%, lymphocytes: 8%), hemoglobin\r\n(Hb): 10.2 g/dl, platelets (PLT): 250,000/mm3, blood sugar:\r\n187, and creatinine: 1.1 mg/dl. Furthermore, COVID-19\r\nPCR was reported positive. According to pleural effusion\r\nobserved in chest CT scan, thoracentesis was performed\r\nand pleural fluid was sent for analysis, bacterial and fungal\r\nsmear, and culture. Blood cultures were negative. The\r\npleural fluid analysis was as follows: turbid appearance,\r\nwhite blood cell >500,000, polymorphonuclear 90%, lactate\r\ndehydrogenase (LDH) 26,448 U/L, sugar <10 mg/dl,\r\nprotein 2.9 g/dl, and albumin 1.9 g/dl. Serum LDH level,\r\ntotal protein, and albumin were 523 U/L, 5.1 g/dl, and\r\n3.2 g/dl, respectively, indicative of empyema, and a chest\r\ntube was inserted.\r\nImipenem 500 mg every 6 h and vancomycin 1 g every\r\n12 h were started as empiric treatment. The result of culture\r\nwas reported klebsiella pneumoniae, which was sensitive\r\nto meropenem and imipenem. The vancomycin\r\nwas discontinued, and imipenem with the addition of\r\namikacin was continued. The patient presented extensive\r\nsubcutaneous emphysema on both sides, and a left chest\r\ntube was inserted (Figure 1). After several days, the left-sided\r\nchest tube came out. According to the right-sided\r\nempyema and no significant improvement, the patient\r\nunderwent right thoracotomy with decortication. Besides,\r\nwedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes, hilar\r\nlymph node biopsy, and parietal pleural peel resection\r\nwere done. The patient's whole lung was extended after\r\nthe procedure, and an anterior and posterior chest tube\r\nwas placed. In the histopathology, right upper lobe wedge\r\nresection revealed a severe suppurative necroinflammatory\r\nprocess associated with the presence of a few partially\r\ndegenerated fungal hyphae (both wide and irregular).\r\nRight lower lobe wedge resection showed extensive severe\r\nsuppurative necroinflammatory process associated with\r\nthe presence of numerous fungal hyphae (both wide and\r\nirregular). Moreover, the vessel wall infiltrated by several\r\nfungal hyphae, including thin and broad fungal hyphae\r\nand calcium oxalate crystals accompanied by fungal hyphae,\r\nwas the indicative of aspergillosis (Figure 2).\r\nHilar lymph node biopsy revealed a fibro-inflammatory\r\nprocess including foci of anthracotic pigment deposition.\r\nFibro-adipose\r\ntissue showed bland-looking\r\ngland-like\r\nstructures, patchy lymphocytic infiltration, and the presence\r\nof a few large cells with cytopathology suggestive of\r\nCMV infection. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed\r\nand confirmed the diagnosis of CMV pneumonia\r\n(Figure 3).\r\nAccording to the invasive fungal infection with both\r\nAspergillus and Mucoraceae species and with the diagnosis\r\nof CMV disease, the liposomal amphotericin B, 5 mg/\r\nkg/day, and intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg every 12 h\r\nwere initiated. Furthermore, the imipenem with amikacin\r\nwas continued for Klebsiella pneumoniae empyema. The\r\npatient signs and symptoms were improved and were afebrile.\r\nAfter the discontinuation of liposomal amphotericin\r\nB and intravenous ganciclovir course, posaconazole oral\r\nFIGURE 1 Multiple thick wall cavitary lesions in the right\r\nupper lobe and ground-glass\r\nopacities with the complicated\r\npneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous\r\nemphysema\r\nPOURABDOLLAH TOUTKABONI et al. | 3 of 5\r\nsuspension 200 mg every 6 h and valganciclovir 900 mg\r\nevery 12 h were started. The patient was discharged after\r\none month with a favorable clinical outcome (Figure 4).\r\n3 | DISCUSSION\r\nThe possibility of SARS-CoV-\r\n2\r\nco-infections\r\nwith bacterial,\r\nfungal, and viral pathogens should not be neglected.\r\nFungal co-infections\r\namong hospitalized patients with coronavirus\r\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19)\r\nare a challenging issue.\r\nFew recent research have shown instances of COVID-19\r\ninfection involving more than one aspergillus species or\r\ntwo separate fungal infections at the same time. Toc et al.\r\nreported a case of COVID-19-\r\nassociated\r\npulmonary aspergillosis\r\nwith Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus\r\nwith favorable outcome.2 Johnson et al.3 reported a case of\r\ncombined probable pulmonary aspergillosis and possible\r\nmucormycosis in a diabetic male with COVID-19\r\nin the\r\nICU who was treated with liposomal amphotericin B.\r\nCritical illness is an important risk factor for CMV\r\nreactivation in terms of the immunosuppression.\r\nAlthough co-infections\r\nwith CMV are frequent in critically\r\nill patients, but the impact on COVID-19\r\npatients\r\nis unclear. Moniz et al.4 presented five case reports of\r\nCMV reactivation in COVID-19\r\npatients admitted to the\r\nICU with respiratory failure. It was well described that\r\ncritical or severe illness can induce immune suppression.\r\nThe most common laboratory finding in patients\r\nwith COVID-19\r\nis lymphopenia, which correlates to disease\r\nseverity. The loss in cell-mediated\r\nimmunity, particularly\r\nthe drop in T-cell\r\nnumbers, has recently been\r\ndiscovered to be the most important factor in disease\r\nseverity.5 On the contrary, the number of iatrogenic factors,\r\nincluding the usage of corticosteroids in the treatment\r\nof severe COVID-19,\r\nmay predispose the patients\r\nto other infections.6 In addition to ICU admission and\r\nmechanical ventilation, other entities, including transfusions,\r\nsepsis, corticosteroids, and acute respiratory\r\ndistress syndrome, were found to be associated with the\r\nrisk of CMV reactivation.7\r\nCo-infections\r\nwith bacteria and fungi may exacerbate\r\nthe course of COVID-19\r\ninfection in a small\r\nFIGURE 2 (A), Suppurative necrosis,\r\nincluding several fungal hyphae, (B),\r\nvessel wall infiltrated by several fungal\r\nhyphae, including thin and broad fungal\r\nhyphae, (C), calcium oxalate crystals\r\naccompanied by fungal hyphae indicative\r\nof aspergillosis\r\n(A) (B) (C)\r\nFIGURE 3 (A), Endothelial cells with cytoplasmic change in\r\nCMV, (B), IHC with CMV antibody confirming CMV cytopathic\r\nchange\r\n(A) (B)\r\n4 of 5 | POURABDOLLAH TOUTKABONI et al.\r\npercentage of individuals. In a retrospective study,\r\nthe second most common respiratory pathogen detected\r\nfrom patients with COVID-19\r\nwas Klebsiella\r\npneumoniae.8,9 Montrucchio et al.10 reported patients\r\nwith COVID-19-\r\nrelated\r\nacute respiratory distress syndrome\r\nwho developed invasive infections in terms of\r\ncarbapenemase-producing\r\nKlebsiella pneumoniae. In\r\nour patient, the culture of empyema and visceral pleural\r\npeel confirmed the superimposed of Klebsiella pneumoniae\r\ninfection on COVID-19.\r\nTissue invasion by a filamentous fungus via the\r\nhistopathological examination of biopsy provides a\r\ndiagnosis of invasive fungal infections, and positive\r\nculture of Aspergillus species from the specimen is required\r\nto make a proven diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.\r\n11 In our case, right upper lobe wedge resection\r\nand right lower lobe wedge resection revealed wide\r\nand irregular fungal hyphae indicative of mucormycosis.\r\nMoreover, the vessel wall infiltrated by several thin\r\nand broad fungal hyphae. Calcium oxalate crystals accompanied\r\nby these fungal hyphae were indicative of\r\naspergillosis. Definitive diagnosis of CMV pneumonia\r\nis determined based on the lung tissue samples by histopathologic\r\ntesting and immunohistochemical analysis.\r\n12 Our case was consistent with the proven CMV\r\npneumonia. According to the histopathology and IHC,\r\nour patient had pulmonary aspergillosis, mucormycosis,\r\nand CMV disease with Klebsiella pneumoniae\r\ninfection. The combined risk factors, including diabetes\r\nmellitus, recent corticosteroid treatment, and\r\nCOVID-19\r\nper se, contributed to concomitant infections\r\nin our patient, which is a unique report.\r\n4 | CONCLUSION\r\nSecondary infections or co-infections\r\nare identified between\r\nSARS-CoV-\r\n2\r\nand other pathogens.
