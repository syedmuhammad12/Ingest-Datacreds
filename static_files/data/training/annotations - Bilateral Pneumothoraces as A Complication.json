He reported that he was unvaccinated against SARSCoV-2. Over the\r\ncourse of two months, he required high-flow nasal cannula, continuous then nocturnal\r\nBIPAP for respiratory support and completed appropriate courses of dexamethasone,\r\nremdesivir, and baricitinib. He also completed a course of levofloxacin due to concern\r\nfor superimposed bacterial pneumonia. After finishing the course of dexamethasone,\r\nthe patient was initiated on a prolonged prednisone taper. His course was complicated\r\nby the development of fibroproliferative acute respiratory distress syndrome two months\r\nafter his initial diagnosis of COVID- 19 requiring continuous followed by nocturnal\r\nBIPAP to maintain adequate oxygenation. Subsequently, he developed recurrent\r\nbilateral, spontaneous pneumothoraces, which required the insertion of multiple chest\r\ntubes due to ongoing air leaks and continued recurrence on removal.\r\nIMPACT/DISCUSSION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to diffuse\r\nalveolar damage in the lung and is increasingly being seen as a complication of COVID-\r\n19. These patients frequently require steroids along with positive pressure ventilation to\r\nmaintain adequate oxygenation. Pneumothorax is a common and sometimes fatal\r\ncomplication of positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress\r\nsyndrome, with some studies quoting an incidence as high as 48%. On the other hand,\r\ndevelopment of spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is\r\nmuch more rare, with studies showing an incidence of approximately 1% and usually\r\nupon the initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, with collapse due to barotrauma in\r\nthe setting of cystic and fibrotic changes in the lung parenchyma. However, there are no\r\ncurrent case reports citing pneumothoraces as late complications of COVID-19 ARDS,\r\nas occurred in our patient two months into his hospitalization, and related solely to\r\nBiPAP use in a patient who never previously underwent endotracheal intubation or\r\nventilation. Additionally, since corticosteroids delay wound healing, it is critical to\r\nrecognize the possibility of developing spontaneous, recurrent pneumothoraces in\r\npatients with COVID-19 on prolonged steroid tapers who are initiating any form of\r\npositive pressure ventilation, including non-invasive ventilation such as BIPAP.\r\nCONCLUSION: Pneumothoraces are rare complications of COVID-19 pneumonia, and\r\nare most commonly seen in males who undergo endotracheal intubation.\r\nCorticosteroids delay wound healing, and prolonged steroid tapers increase the risk of\r\nrecurrent pneumothoraces once one develops. Clinicians must be wary of this rare, late\r\ncomplication of patients with COVID-19 ARDS and prolonged steroid exposure and\r\nshould be extra judicious with the use of positive pressure ventilation.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nbaricitinib; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; levofloxacin; prednisone; remdesivir\r\nRecord downloaded - Mon 9 05 13:10:11 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\ncoronavirus disease 2019; spontaneous pneumothorax\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nadult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; artificial ventilation; assisted ventilation;\r\nbacterial pneumonia; barotrauma; bilevel positive airway pressure; case report; chest\r\ntube; clinical article; collapse; complication; conference abstract; diffuse alveolar\r\ndamage; drug fatality; endotracheal intubation; high flow nasal cannula therapy;\r\nhospitalization; human; incidence; invasive ventilation; lung development; lung\r\nparenchyma; male; medical history; noninvasive ventilation; oxygenation; positive\r\npressure ventilation; respiratory failure; wound healing\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\nbaricitinib (1187594-09-7)\r\ndexamethasone (50-02-2)\r\nlevofloxacin (100986-85-4, 138199-71-0)\r\nprednisone (53-03-2)\r\nremdesivir (1809249-37-3)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\nEnglish\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\nEnglish\r\nPUI\r\nL638738585\r\nDOI\r\n10.1007/s11606-022-07653-8\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07653-8\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L638738585&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",{"entities":[[394,408,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[837,850,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[1021,1023,"REPORTERTITLE"],[1024,1025,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[1026,1030,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[1032,1074,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[1076,1093,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[1095,1107,"REPORTERCITY"],[1109,1121,"REPORTERSTATE"],[1149,1312,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1335,1354,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1356,1391,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1393,1424,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1426,1458,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1460,1475,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1477,1515,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1517,1535,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1537,1559,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1583,1607,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1630,1640,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1642,1654,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1656,1667,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1686,1699,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1701,1711,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1722,1732,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1734,1746,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1748,1759,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1761,1774,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1776,1786,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1805,1823,"DRUGINDICATION"],[1825,1847,"DRUGINDICATION"],[1870,1894,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1916,1927,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[1928,1931,"PATIENTSEX"],[1937,1972,"PATIENTMEDICALHISTORYTEXT"],[1988,2004,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2106,2137,"PATIENTMEDICALHISTORYTEXT"],[2207,2232,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2409,2442,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2598,2616,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[3953,3988,"SERIOUSNESSHOSPITALIZATION"]]}]]}
