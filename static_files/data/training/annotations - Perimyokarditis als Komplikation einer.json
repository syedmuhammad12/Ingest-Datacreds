Depending on the severity and location of the inflammation, drugs such as corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), immunosuppressants and biologicals as well as small molecules, such as Janus kinase inhibitors, are used for acute therapy [1]. Appropriate recommendations from national and international specialist societies exist for the diagnostic and therapeutic regimen [1–3].\r\nIn recent years, various complications in connection with therapy for ulcerative colitis has been described as occurring, on the one hand due to the therapy and on the other hand due to the disease itself [4–6]. Treatment for an acute relapse is made more difficult if, on the one hand, there are complicated courses as a result of side effects from medications and, on the other hand, the agent causing them cannot be unambiguously identified at first, since different preparations are used at the same time.\r\nThe present case study reports on a 19-year-old male patient who initially suffered a progressive deterioration in his general condition as part of acute therapy for ulcerative colitis. There was an initial improvement in symptoms under drug therapy. In spite of increased laboratory infection values, the patient discharged himself from the hospital against medical advice. After 2 weeks, the patient was hospitalized again on an emergency basis.\r\nThe supplementary diagnosis ultimately revealed a finding of perimyocarditis as the most likely cause of the aggravation. Ultimately, by changing the drug treatment, the abdominal problems could be successfully treated first, followed by the cardiac problems over the protracted course.\r\n\r\n\r\nCase report\r\nMedical History\r\nThere was an emergency inpatient presentation of a 19-year-old man with an acute episode of ulcerative colitis in the gastroenterology department of our hospital. This was first diagnosed in the patient about a year earlier. There had been long-term therapy with topical and oral 5-ASA. The patient had been complaining of abdominal pain and bloody bowel movements for 6 weeks, with a clear progression of symptoms for a week and a half. Treatment with prednisolone 40mg had already been initiated on an outpatient basis (approx. 0.6mg/kg BW).\r\nWe administered a high-dose prednisolone therapy (60 mg; 1-0-0 orally) with an accompanying switch to a completely parenteral diet. Despite the therapy, the patient developed recurrent episodes of fever with increasing infection parameters on laboratory examination. The procalcitonin value was in the normal range at 0.15 ng/ml (reference: < 0.25 ng/ml). The empirical combined administration of an aminopenicillin and nitroimidazole only led to moderate control of the infection. However, supplementing prednisolone therapy with a monoclonal antibody (vedolizumab) improved the clinical condition, with the patient discharging himself home against medical advice. In the following 2 weeks, he developed recurrent episodes of fever again, which led to another emergency inpatient admission in our hospital.\r\n\r\nInvestigations\r\nIn the initial blood cultures performed, only Acinetobacter ursingii could be detected as a possible trigger of the current infection. The patient was provided with a central venous catheter at the same time.\r\nDue to the significant performance weakness with clinically prominent dyspnea symptoms according to NYHA (New York Heart Association) III, new-onset leg edema and recurrent thoracic pressure, we supplemented the diagnostics with a transthoracic echocardiography. A hemodynamically irrelevant pericardial effusion was detected here (▶ Fig. 1a, b). The left ventricular ejection fraction was slightly restricted at approx. 50%.\r\nTransesophageal echocardiography subsequently ruled out the presence of infectious endocarditis. An acute cardiac disease was confirmed serologically by the serological detection of significantly increased NT-proBNP (N terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide) and troponin values (▶  Fig. 2a, b). The subsequent MRI examination of the heart provided a diagnosis of acute perimyocarditis. A minimal amount of ascites was detected in the abdomen sonography. The rectoscopy showed an active ulcerative colitis with signs of bleeding.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n▶ Fig. 1 a–d Transthoracic echocardiography with modified parasternal long a and short b axial section at the time of diagnosis of perimyocarditis. The red arrow shows the pericardial fluid accumulation.\r\n\r\n \r\nBased on the available findings and the clinical symptoms, the patient was temporarily monitored for intensive care.\r\nThe same echocardiographic projections were seen approximately 4 weeks after discontinuing mesalazine administration and switching from antibody therapy to infliximab (1c + d). The green arrow shows the almost complete regression of the pericardial effusion.\r\n\r\nTherapy and clinical course\r\nInitiation of resistogram-compatible anti-infective therapy with meropenem after re-admission. We also discontinued mesalazine drug therapy, and integrin antibody treatment was discontinued. During the steroid refractory course, antibody therapy with a tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker (infliximab; initially 5mg/kg BW) was started. The patient developed a fever for a day on this regimen. The next day, his fever was gone. As symptomatic therapy, we initiated therapy with pethidine due to the pronounced pain symptoms. Due to the initially persistent bloody diarrhea, the patient received a total of 4 erythrocyte concentrates. On this regimen, the hemoglobin value remained stable. Enteral nutrition was not possible at first, so it was necessary to temporarily switch to parenteral food intake.\r\nAccording to the UpToDate recommendations [7], due to the insufficient response, the patient received an increased dose of the antibody during the 2nd administration (10 mg/kg BW). The patient developed a fever for a day this time as well. Overall, however, the dose was tolerated much better with accompanying cetirizine administration.\r\nFrom a cardiological perspective, forced diuretic therapy was initially started for the treatment of the incipient cardiac decompensation. This was done as first-line therapy for pulmonary congestion with clinically prominent dyspnea and incipient leg edema on both sides. In addition, an appropriate drug-based heart failure therapy was started in accordance with the current national recommendations [8].\r\nAt that time, the patient had categorically ruled out a colectomy as a possible treatment option. The 3rd antibody dose was thus administered (5 mg/kg BW), which was well tolerated without further problems. The patient received a final (4th) antibody substitution shortly before the planned discharge from the hospital. Due to the fulminant course, the administration of infliximab was carried out in the same manner with shortened breaks.\r\nUnder this therapy, there was gradually a slow improvement in the general condition. Bowel movements were no longer bloody, and the frequency decreased significantly. Left ventricular function improved to the normal range on echocardiographic examination. The pericardial effusion was clearly regressive (▶ Fig. 1c, d).\r\nAn unclear glossitis developed as a complication under parenteral nutrition. Another gastroscopic and supplementary presentation to the ENT doctor resulted in the diagnosis of proximal thrush esophagitis. This was treated with fluconazole for 2 more weeks.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n▶ Fig. 2 a, b Laboratory follow-ups for NT-proBNP and troponin on different examination days as evidence of myocardial damage.\r\n\r\n \r\nAs a further supportive measure, the patient received intravenous iron substitution during his inpatient stay. Osteoporosis prophylaxis was also carried out.\r\nThere was only a very protracted clinical improvement under the measures mentioned. The temporary parenteral diet was switched to an oral diet. Temporary mobilization by means of a rollator could be discontinued under intensive physiotherapeutic supervision.\r\nAnother infliximab administration in the outpatient course was most recently planned. Due to the existing infliximab/decortin therapy, the patient received PCP prophylaxis (pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia) with co-trimoxazole. A rehabilitative measure following the inpatient stay was organized.\r\nAfter a 2-month hospital stay, the patient was finally able to be discharged into outpatient medical care with improved symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nIn recent years, there have been increasing reports of cardiac complications associated with the diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis [9]. These were mostly associated with the administration of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and/or antibodies, here mostly anti-TNF [4, 5, 10-12].\r\nIn our case report, we describe the case of a 19-year-old man with acute relapse of ulcerative colitis. Under concomitant therapy with a steroid, a monoclonal antibody (Entyvio), 5-aminosalicylic acid and a supplementary anti-infective medication, the patient developed acute perimyocarditis with clinical signs of acute cardiac decompensation. The antibody had been administered about one and a half weeks before the described complaints developed for the first and last time as part of an inpatient stay.\r\nAnother reason for the rapid clinical deterioration of the patient within a few days could be the cultural detection of Acinetobacter ursingii in the blood cultures. However, the overall clinical constellation (abdominal and cardiac complaints), the adequate and rapid response of anti-infective therapy with meropenem and ultimately the exclusion of infectious endocarditis make this assumption rather unlikely.\r\nOur report shows that, even after longer-term 5-ASA therapy, the development of perimyocarditis as a complication as described in the literature is possible. As a newly initiated therapy with a direct temporal reference, the integrin antagonist is also considered as the cause of perimyocarditis in our case report. To our knowledge, no case reports on this have been published to date. A corresponding notification of the case was therefore promptly made to the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM [Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte]).\r\nWith the early detection of a complication, therapeutic management is based on the symptoms and the most likely underlying cause if the cause is initially unclear. Close, ideally intensive monitoring of patients is sensible here. Since we could not find a clear cause for the increasing clinical deterioration in the near-term course, we decided to discontinue the existing medication with mesalazine and the integrin antibody.\r\nFor our clinic, we have decided that in the future, all patients with acute relapse of a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with regard to the rare complication of perimyocarditis will be screened and, with an appropriate clinical picture and symptoms, receive a non-invasive cardiological consultation at an early stage to rule out potential cardiac complications. This is initially done as part of a simple cardiac history and, depending on the symptoms, can be supplemented by ECG, laboratory chemical parameters (e.g. troponin, CK, CK-MB, BNP...) as well as imaging methods.\r\nEarly re-evaluations must be carried out in case there is no response to the initiated therapeutic measures,\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n▶ Fig. 3 Example of a possible algorithm for cardiological screening in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD) before, during and after immunomodulating therapy\r\n\r\n \r\n\t\r\nKEY MESSAGES\r\n\tThe development of cardiac complications under therapeutic agents for chronic inflammatory bowel disease is possible.\r\n\tImmediate discontinuation of the complete immunosuppressive therapy with multiple therapy can be a useful approach if the triggering medication in the event of further clinical deterioration remains unclear.\r\n\tEven in otherwise healthy young people, the response to immunosuppressive therapy can generally be accompanied by severe clinical courses.\r\n\tClose cooperation between different disciplines is essential for a successful therapy.\r\n\tWhile on therapeutic agents for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, monitoring for cardiological complications is very important – early cardiac diagnostics are therefore highly recommended in the event of clinical suspicions. We have depicted an example of a possible algorithm for cardiological screening in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD) before, during and after immunomodulating therapy (▶ Fig. 3).\r\n \r\nInteressenkonflikt\r\nThe authors state that there are no conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nBauer M, Baholli L, Uflacker L, Rolffs S.

This is initially done as part of a simple cardiac history and, depending on the symptoms, can be supplemented by ECG, laboratory chemical parameters (e.g. troponin, CK, CK-MB, BNP...) as well as imaging methods.\r\nEarly re-evaluations must be carried out in case there is no response to the initiated therapeutic measures,\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n▶ Fig. 3 Example of a possible algorithm for cardiological screening in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD) before, during and after immunomodulating therapy\r\n\r\n \r\n\t\r\nKEY MESSAGES\r\n\tThe development of cardiac complications under therapeutic agents for chronic inflammatory bowel disease is possible.\r\n\tImmediate discontinuation of the complete immunosuppressive therapy with multiple therapy can be a useful approach if the triggering medication in the event of further clinical deterioration remains unclear.\r\n\tEven in otherwise healthy young people, the response to immunosuppressive therapy can generally be accompanied by severe clinical courses.\r\n\tClose cooperation between different disciplines is essential for a successful therapy.\r\n\tWhile on therapeutic agents for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, monitoring for cardiological complications is very important – early cardiac diagnostics are therefore highly recommended in the event of clinical suspicions. We have depicted an example of a possible algorithm for cardiological screening in chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD) before, during and after immunomodulating therapy (▶ Fig. 3).\r\n \r\nInteressenkonflikt\r\nThe authors state that there are no conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nBauer M, Baholli L, Uflacker L, Rolffs S.
