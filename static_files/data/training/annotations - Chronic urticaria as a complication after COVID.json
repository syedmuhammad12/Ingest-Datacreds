Expression of the receptor has been found not only in the airways but also in the gastrointestinal tract and skin. The highest ACE2 expression level has been shown in the small intestine, testes, kidneys, heart, thyroid and adipose tissue, and the lowest expression level in blood, spleen, bone marrow, brain and blood vessels.\r\n     The percentage of ACE2-positive keratinocytes in the skin is 97.37%. Keratinocytes occur at various stages of differentiation and they are responsible for the formation of tight connections with nerves in the skin; in addition, \r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey maintain epidermal Langerhans cells and lymphocytes in the dermis in place. Furthermore, keratinocytes contribute to immune system function (e.g. inflammatory response to injury).\r\n   Skin lesions develop in patients with COVID-19 at any age and with various severity and their estimated frequency is approx. 40%. As COVID-19 develops with progression to pneumonia, an extreme increase in proinflammatory cytokines occurs, in particular for IL-6, one of interleukins. When cytokines enter the skin through dendritic cells, they stimulate macrophages, mast cells and lymphocytes, which ultimately results in associated skin lesions [1].\r\n   Among the skin lesions due to COVID-19, skin lesions mainly affecting the superficial layers and vascular lesions are known [2]. The lesions may be macular or vesicular and may \r\r\r    \r\r\r\rCorrespondence address:\r\nGrazyna Piotrowicz, M.D., Ph.D.\r\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, \r\nMSWiA (Ministerstwo Spraw Wewnetrznych i Administracji [Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration]) Hospital in Gdansk\r\nul.

Urticaria may be acute or chronic. The acute form tends to be self-limiting; symptoms remain for up to 6 weeks, and the estimated incidence is approx. 20% of the population. The chronic type is confirmed when skin lesions remain for more than 6 weeks (it affects approx. 5% of the population) [3]. A specific feature of urticaria associated with COVID-19 is that skin symptoms develop simultaneously as disease symptoms and the estimated duration of skin lesions is 6-8 days [2]. Skin lesions occur mainly in the trunk and limbs and may be associated with angioedema. The estimated incidence of urticaria is 16-19% of all skin symptoms due to COVID-19 [4]. Medicines being administered, mainly antibiotics, and immune system hyperactivity with cytokine storm which also affects the skin (activation of perivascular lymphocytes) are thought to be the cause of urticaria, even though the rash due to COVID-19 is a non-typical form of skin lesions due to infection with a coronavirus family virus [2].\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE REPORT\r\n\r\nA female patient aged 57 years with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) confirmed in 1992; history of diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) confirmed in 2017; she had a surgery due to intra-abdominal abscesses that year; in addition, right-sided hemicolectomy was performed at that time with stoma creation in the descending colon. The patient had been followed by a gastroenterology clinic of the MSWiA Hospital in Gdansk since 2017.\r\n   Due to liver injury induced by mesalazine, azathioprine and methotrexate as well as mesalazine-related interstitial nephritis, the patient was found eligible for treatment in a drug program. She received infliximab twice: in a one-year cycle in 2017 and a two-year cycle in 2018-2019. She consulted us again in September 2021 due to exacerbation of complaints related to the underlying disease (CD). In April 2021, the patient had COVID-19 with a mild course (she had not been vaccinated yet), but symptoms of urticaria associated with symptoms of angioedema developed on day 3 after the onset (Fig. 1). \r\r\rSerious skin lesions were persistent and resolved in June 2021. At that time, systemic steroids (Metypred from 6 to 2 mg as the maintenance dose) and antihistamine agents were administered. When discontinuation of the steroids was attempted, the skin and vascular symptoms worsened. Steroids, histamine inhibitors and JAK inhibitors which act by blocking IL-6 are the first-line medicines in chronic urticaria [1]. Because the symptoms related to the underlying disease worsened, it was decided to evaluate eligibility for infliximab therapy again. \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r[bilingual text]\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\rThe patient currently does not use any steroids or antihistamine agents. The skin lesions completely resolved and the clinical status in terms of CD-related complaints also improved.\r\r[bilingual text]\r\n\r\nAn allergic reaction on the upper limb skin developed after the first dose (Fig. 2) which resolved spontaneously within several hours. It was decided to continue biologic therapy in a hospital setting. No allergy symptoms were reported after the second dose and it was decided to discontinue steroids while antihistamine agents were sustained for several months.\rSUMMARY\r\nThe development of skin lesions due to COVID-19 is a complex process which is yet to be fully understood. The biologic drug administered within the continuation of CD therapy in this case turned out to be a good decision with therapeutic benefit, purportedly also in terms of the chronic urticaria, an autoimmune condition, induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection [3].\rM Fiorito, NYU Langone Hospital,Pediatrics, 120 Mineola Blvd, Suite 210, Mineola, New York, NY, 11501, US, Abuso S, Rubin L, Geraghty B, Hoque T, Better D, Kumar TKS, et al.

Multivalvular Endocarditis With Abscess: A Wild Goose Chase. The Pediatric infectious disease journal. 2022;41(7):e296-9 on 17 Jun 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from The United States of America and concerns a 19-years-old male patient who experienced serious adverse drug reaction of worsening renal function associated with gentamicin. This patient with a congenitally diagnosed bicuspid aortic valve presented to NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island with a 5-month history of fatigue, intermittent cough, rashes, intermittent fevers, 25-pound weight loss, and migrating joint pain. Five weeks before presentation, he developed night sweats, and fevers became daily and continuous. Patient had no international travel history and resided in Long Island, NY. He denied any recent dental work or intravenous drug use. He was seen by his primary care provider, diagnosed with clinical pneumonia, and given azithromycin with improvement. A week after discontinuation of antibiotics, he developed a red blotchy rash on the plantar surface of his right foot with recurrence of fever. His primary care provider diagnosed him with cellulitis and started him on amoxicillin-clavulanate with resolution of rash and defervescence. Approximately 2�3 weeks later, fevers recurred, accompanied by a painful, petechial rash to the sole of his foot. He was restarted on amoxicillin-clavulanate with resolution of rash and fevers. Bloodwork done at that time, including antinuclear antibody, tuberculosis testing, HIV, Hepatitis A-C serology, and Babesia microti serology, was unremarkable. He was evaluated by his outpatient cardiologist, where echocardiogram showed no change to his underlying bicuspid aortic valve and limited visualization of the mitral valve. The patient was referred to rheumatology for further evaluation after rheumatoid factor returned mildly positive. A working diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever was considered by rheumatology; the patient was empirically started on colchicine without improvement. He was referred to oncology, where concern for lymphoma prompted imaging. CT scan of his chest and abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and subcentimeter axillary lymph nodes. positron emission tomography scan showed hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse, mildly increased uptake within the bone marrow and tonsils. A bone marrow biopsy was recommended. The patient saw another oncologist who drew basic labs and, for the first time, a blood culture, which grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs. He presented to pediatric emergency room for further workup and management. In the emergency room, he was febrile (101.1-degree F) and tachycardic (heart rate 125). Antibiotic therapy was initiated with 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone. Patient was noted to have rash on the bilateral plantar surfaces of his feet and the dorsum of his hands with tenderness to palpation. Patient was noted to have a grade II/VI mid systolic murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border; his mother reported this was not a new finding. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission showed 2 small masses in the 4�6x10-14 mm range on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The bicuspid aortic valve showed moderate dysfunction with mild-to-moderate insufficiency and accompanying left ventricular dilation and a mildly dilated ascending aorta. There was trivial mitral valve insufficiency. In combination with the positive blood culture from the outside hospital, he was diagnosed with IE (infective endocarditis). Gentamicin was added to his therapy as per AHA recommendations. He was evaluated by dental and had no evidence of obvious caries, however, he reported he had not seen a dentist in over 5 years. On hospital day 2, blood culture grew Streptococcus mutans and gentamicin was discontinued. An MRA/magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple small septic emboli. CT angiogram of the head and neck were unremarkable. Because of concern for potential deterioration and need for cardiothoracic surgical intervention, the patient was transferred to NYU Langone Hospital in Manhattan, NY. Upon transfer, patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram, which showed vegetations on the aortic and mitral valves. An abscess near the aortic root with evidence of dissection and an 8 mm aneurysm of the intervalvular fibrosa were seen alongside moderate regurgitation with moderate stenosis of the aortic valve. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen was ordered secondary to abdominal pain, and revealed a thick-walled rim enhancement with internal septations consistent with a splenic abscess, and an evolving infarct in the left kidney lower pole. Percutaneous drainage of the abscess was attempted by interventional radiology but minimal fluid was aspirated. Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed to reduce the risk of reinfection after heart surgery. Given extensive valvular involvement and severe aortic stenosis with regurgitation, the aortic valve was replaced using a pulmonary autograft (Ross) procedure. Mitral valve vegetations were removed with valve repair. Gram stain of the valve tissue showed Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains; culture was negative. Patient tolerated the procedure well with notable improvement. Patient continued on ceftriaxone; gentamicin was initially restarted and stopped early in the postoperative course because of worsening renal function. The patient was later switched to penicillin for a total of 6 weeks. Follow-up information has been requested.\r\n\r\n69\rGASTROENTEROLOGIA PRAKTYCZNA � 4/2021\r\r\n\r\n70\rGASTROENTEROLOGIA PRAKTYCZNA � 4/2021\r\r\n\r\n",{"entities":[[3410,3439,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[6064,6065,"REPORTERMIDDLENAME"],[6066,6073,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[6075,6095,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[6096,6106,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[6108,6144,"REPORTERSTREET"],[6146,6154,"REPORTERCITY"],[6156,6158,"REPORTERSTATE"],[6160,6165,"REPORTERPOSTCODE"],[6167,6169,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[6171,6392,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[6848,6872,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[6963,6987,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[7549,7567,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[7579,7591,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[7829,7852,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[8173,8176,"TESTNAME"],[8178,8200,"TESTNAME"],[8206,8230,"TESTNAME"],[8236,8249,"TESTRESULT"],[8661,8671,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[8767,8787,"TESTNAME"],[8807,8825,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[8866,8894,"TESTNAME"],[8907,8937,"TESTRESULT"],[9698,9726,"TESTNAME"],[9753,9787,"TESTRESULT"],[10020,10055,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[10252,10271,"TESTNAME"],[10280,10309,"TESTRESULT"],[10394,10407,"TESTNAME"],[10408,10433,"TESTRESULT"],[10850,10894,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[10944,10954,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[10967,11004,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[11334,11370,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[11628,11653,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[11836,11843,"TESTNAME"],[11848,11857,"TESTRESULT"]]}]]}
