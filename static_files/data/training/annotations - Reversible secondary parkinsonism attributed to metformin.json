Background: Secondary parkinsonism\r\ncan be caused by a variety of conditions including medications, toxins, tumors, and\r\nvascular lesions. Metformin has been thought to cause parkinsonism in those with renal\r\nimpairment but has rarely been reported. Methods: Relevant medical history, physical\r\nexamination, laboratory findings, neuroimaging, and clinical course are described.\r\nResults: On initial presentation, a 59-year-old man with history of type II diabetes and\r\nend stage renal disease presented to the Emergency Room with a two-day history of\r\nspeech and difficulty walking. Ancillary data disclosed a mild lactic acidosis and\r\nsymmetric bilateral putaminal T2 FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery)\r\nhyperintensities; toxidrome workup was unrevealing. He experienced some clinical\r\nimprovement after hemodialysis and was discharged with outpatient follow-up arranged.\r\nOne month later, the patient was admitted for hypertensive crisis and lactic acidosis with\r\nan exam consistent with marked parkinsonism. Repeat imaging demonstrated diffuse\r\nsymmetric T2 FLAIR hyperintensities within the bilateral basal ganglia. Extensive\r\nmetabolic workup was normal. Prompted by additional history, serum metformin levels\r\nwere measured and found to be elevated to a degree consistent with the development\r\nof lactic acidosis. The patient continued to receive scheduled hemodialysis while in the\r\nhospital and metformin was discontinued. He experienced dramatic improvement in\r\nextrapyramidal symptoms within 14 days. Conclusions: Metformin use in those with\r\nadvanced renal impairment may cause a reversible secondary parkinsonism associated\r\nwith lactic acidosis and MR FLAIR changes within the basal ganglia.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n metformin\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\n toxin\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n hemodialysis; lactic acidosis; secondary parkinsonism\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\n adult; adverse drug reaction; basal ganglion; case report; clinical article; conference\r\nabstract; diabetes mellitus; drug therapy; emergency ward; end stage renal disease;\r\nextrapyramidal symptom; fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging; follow up;\r\nhuman; human tissue; hypertensive crisis; kidney disease; male; medical history;\r\nmiddle aged; neuroimaging; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outpatient;\r\nparkinsonism; physical examination; side effect; speech disorder; toxidrome;\r\nvascular tumor; walking\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\n metformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)\r\nRecord downloaded - Tue 11 08 06:00:23 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\n English\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\n English\r\nPUI\r\n L639305609\r\nDOI\r\n 10.1002/mds.29223\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mds.29223\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L639305609&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nBailey G, Salinas V, Dewey R, Salinas M, Tardo L.
