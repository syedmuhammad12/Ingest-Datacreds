Her symptoms included cough, which\r\nhad persisted for 5 days and sore throat. She was obese\r\n(body mass index, 29.5 kg/m2\r\n) and had diabetes mellitus,\r\ndyslipidemia, hypertension, and a history of cholecystec\u0002tomy. Remdesivir and dexamethasone (6 mg) improved her\r\nsymptoms. On the 14th day after the development of\r\nCOVID-19, her serum levels of pancreatic enzymes were\r\nelevated (Picture, upper). Simultaneously, abdominal tender\u0002ness appeared and computed tomography showed an en\u0002larged pancreatic parenchyma (Picture, lower). She was di\u0002agnosed with acute pancreatitis, which was ameliorated by\r\nfasting and fluid therapy.\r\nCOVID-19 is rarely complicated by acute pancreatitis (1).\r\nIn such cases, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in\r\npancreatic cells may be associated with the pathogenesis (2).\r\nConsidering that pancreatitis occurred after the administra\u0002tion of dexamethasone and remdesivir, these drugs might\r\nhave been involved in the pancreatitis of our case. This case\r\nsuggested that acute pancreatitis could develop immediately\r\nafter treatment for COVID-19.\r\nThe authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).\r\n１Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan and ２De\u0002partment of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan\r\nReceived: February 22, 2021; Accepted: March 30, 2021; Advance Publication by J-STAGE: May 14, 2021\r\nCorrespondence to Dr. Koichiro Yamamoto, pi291nd8@s.okayama-u.ac.jp\r\nIntern Med Advance Publication DOI: 10.2169/internalmedicine.7400-21\r\n2\r\nReferences\r\n1.

This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Japan and concerns a 70-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis associated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. A woman presented with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Her symptoms included cough, which had persisted for 5 days, and sore throat.
