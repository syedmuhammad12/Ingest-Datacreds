Lab work was notable for persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase.\r\n12 months prior to this admission, the patient was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia\r\nfor a week of ongoing fever, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. Her hospital\r\ncourse was complicated by PE, ARDS, pneumothorax, required chest tube placement,\r\nintubation and ECMO. She was treated with dexamethasone, remdesivir, ceftriaxone,\r\nazithromycin, and convalescent plasma. Unfortunately, the patient developed post-\r\nARDS pulmonary fibrosis and she was unable to wean off ECMO. Three months later,\r\nshe underwent lung transplantation for postCOVID ARDS. Post- operative course was\r\nsignificant for profound shock intraoperatively, acute blood loss with delayed chest\r\nclosure, Grade 3 primary graft dysfunction (PGD), critical illness myopathy, AKI with a\r\nneed for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) / hemodialysis, and Aspergillus\r\npneumonia. She received two doses of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent a\r\nbone scan that showed asymmetrically increased uptake in the bilateral femoral\r\nmetadiaphysis, metaphysis, and proximal tibial metaphysis. There was questionable\r\nincreased uptake in the humeral heads. MRI of the tibia showed bilateral distal tibial\r\nmetaphysis/epiphysis heterogeneous T1 and T2 signal intensity lesions compatible with\r\nintramedullary infarct. There was no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. Overall,\r\nthe findings were consistent with multifocal osteonecrosis secondary to corticosteroid\r\ntreatment. She is currently managed with analgesics in view of a nonsurgical approach\r\nas advised by the orthopedic team. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Coronavirus disease 2019\r\n(COVID-19) pandemic continues to present critical challenges for public health and\r\nmedical communities globally. Its manifestations are predominantly respiratory, with\r\nmultiorgan dysfunction in severe cases. Skeletal involvement is uncommon. Systemic\r\ncorticosteroids such as dexamethasone are frequently used as the standard of care for\r\ncritically ill COVID-19 patients to alleviate the hyperinflammatory response and reduce\r\nthe need for mechanical ventilation. However, long-term treatment with dexamethasone\r\ncan increase the risk of the development of osteonecrosis. In this case report, to our\r\nknowledge, we describe the first case of multifocal bone infarction in a patient treated\r\nwith corticosteroids status-post lung transplant secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.\r\nCONCLUSION: Recognizing clinical features of multifocal bone infarct as a late effect of\r\ncorticosteroid treatment may be challenging given a complicated history of transplant\r\nand COVID-19. However, it may be prudent to consider osteonecrosis when a patient\r\nwith prior steroid treatment history presents with musculoskeletal complaints.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\ncorticosteroid\r\nRecord downloaded - Mon 9 05 12:40:04 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nanalgesic agent; azithromycin; ceftriaxone; convalescent plasma; dexamethasone;\r\nremdesivir\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\nadult respiratory distress syndrome; avascular necrosis; coronavirus disease 2019;\r\nhemodialysis; lung transplantation\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nadult; adverse drug reaction; artificial ventilation; Aspergillus; bleeding; bone\r\nscintiscanning; case report; chest tube; clinical article; clinical feature; complication;\r\nconference abstract; continuous renal replacement therapy; corticosteroid therapy;\r\ncritical illness myopathy; critically ill patient; drug combination; drug therapy; dyspnea;\r\nepiphysis; female; fever; fracture dislocation; health care quality; Hispanic; human;\r\nhumeral head; hyperinflammation; hyperphosphatasemia; intubation; long term care;\r\nlower limb; lung fibrosis; metaphysis; multiple organ failure; musculoskeletal disease;\r\nnonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pandemic; patient history of\r\ntransplantation; pneumonia; pneumothorax; primary graft dysfunction; public health;\r\nside effect; surgery; thorax pain; tibial metaphysis; vaccination; weaning\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\nazithromycin (83905-01-5, 117772-70-0, 121470-24-4)\r\nceftriaxone (73384-59-5, 74578-69-1)\r\ndexamethasone (50-02-2)\r\nremdesivir (1809249-37-3)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\nEnglish\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\nEnglish\r\nPUI\r\nL638738723\r\nDOI\r\n10.1007/s11606-022-07653-8\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-022-07653-8\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L638738723&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomaratna A, Wang J.
