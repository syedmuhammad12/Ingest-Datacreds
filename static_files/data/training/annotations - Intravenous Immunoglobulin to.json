However,\nthese effects have been observed in a limited number of clinical cases. We report the case of\na patient with metastatic breast cancer in which long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease\nprogression in the absence of salvage chemotherapy. The patient was treated with IVIG for\nthe treatment of immune thrombocytopenia. Surprisingly, the lung and brain metastases\nwere stabilized, and the patient achieved a progression-free interval of 29 months. More\ncases are needed to investigate and confirm the efficacy of IVIG in solid tumors in the future.\nKeywords: Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Immunoglobulins, Intravenous; Purpura,\nThrombocytopenic, Idiopathic\n\n\nresultstestsprocedures- TEST 10058542 (25.0) antiplatelet antibody test : during the 6-month follow-up; TEST 10072954 (25.0) chest CT : during the 6-month follow-up; TEST 10059938 (25.0) laboratory studies : during the 6-month follow-up; TEST 10005983 (25.0) Bone marrow biopsy : during the 6-month follow-up; TEST 10035525 (25.0) platelet count : during the 6-month follow-up; TEST 10072954 (25.0) chest CT (2016) : during the 6-month follow-up; TEST 10072954 (25.0) chest CT (201809) : during the 6-month follow-up; \npatientepisodename - Invasive ductal breast carcinoma stage I, Sjogren's syndrome, Breast conserving surgery\nreactionmeddrallt - Immune thrombocytopenia, Menorrhagia\ntestname - MRI brain, Anti-platelet antibody, Progesterone receptor assay, Chest CT, Immunohistochemistry, Estrogen receptor assay, Biopsy, Platelet count, Human epidermal growth factor receptor negative, Imaging procedure, Laboratory test, Bone marrow biopsy\nmedicinalproduct- FLUOROURACIL, EPIRUBICIN, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE\nactivesubstancename - FLUOROURACIL, EPIRUBICIN, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE\ndrugindication - Invasive ductal breast carcinoma stage I\ndrugreactionasses - Menorrhagia, Immune thrombocytopenia\n\nINTRODUCTION\nImmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease characterized by\nisolated thrombocytopenia [1]. ITP results in autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets\nin the spleen. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is derived from donor plasma and\ncontains purified immunoglobulin G (IgG). IVIG is used to treat various diseases, including\nimmunodeficiency, as well as autoimmune, systemic inflammatory, and neurodegenerative\ndisorders [2]. IVIG exhibits anticancer effects that suppress metastases in several animal\nmodels [3,4]. However, these effects were observed in a limited number of patients,\nincluding a case report and a clinical study of metastatic melanoma [5,6] and a case report\nof soft tissue sarcoma [7]. Here, we report that long-term IVIG treatment stopped disease\nprogression in a patient with advanced breast cancer with lung and brain metastases in the\nabsence of salvage breast cancer therapy.\n\nConflict of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no\ncompeting interests.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nAuthor Contributions\nConceptualization: Chao TC, Chen MH;\nInvestigation: Lin KL, Chao TC, Chen MH;\n\nA 43-year-old woman was diagnosed with Sjogren syndrome with dryness of the eyes and\nmouth since 2006.

Figure 2 summarizes the entire clinical course, treatment, and\nresponse of the patient. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen receptor, progesterone\nreceptor, and human epithelial growth factor receptor were negative. She underwent breast\nconservation surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and\nfluorouracil. She received three cycles of chemotherapy, and thrombocytopenia developed\nafter the second cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count,16,000/\nµL) persisted and became refractory to platelet transfusion after the third cycle of adjuvant\nchemotherapy. In addition, the patient had severe menorrhagia. As a result, adjuvant\nchemotherapy was discontinued, and chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia was\nsuspected. However, the platelet count did not recover to baseline during the 6-month\nfollow-up. Bone marrow biopsy and all pertinent laboratory studies were normal except for\na positive antiplatelet antibody test; therefore, a clinical diagnosis of ITP was established.\nEltrombopag (25 mg daily), hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and\ndanazol were administered, but the response was limited. Splenectomy was not considered\nbecause of the high risk of bleeding. Subsequently, she did not receive any cancer treatment.\nThe patient developed lung metastases with a diameter of 1 cm in the right lower lobe (Figure 3)\nand tiny subpleural nodules in the right middle lobe 28 months after the operation. Six months\nlater, the patient suffered from severe vertigo, headache, and vomiting. Magnetic resonance\n\nFigure 1. Contrast-enhanced chest CT imaging.

The red arrows indicated the metastatic lung lesions.\nIVIG = intravenous immunoglobulin.\n\nimaging of the brain revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar\nhemispheres, with the largest measuring 2.3 cm (Figure 4). Brain metastases were confirmed\nradiologically. Whole-brain radiotherapy was administered (14 fractions of 3500 mGy) in March\n2019. The sizes of the brain metastases were all regressed (with the largest size of approximately\n1.3 cm) (Figure 4B). For refractory ITP and a high risk of bleeding, the patient began to receive\nIVIGs at a dosage of 0.4 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Her platelet count recovered\nto approximately 100,000/µL in subsequent cycles of IVIG therapy. Notably, the lung metastases\nslightly decreased half a year after the initiation of IVIG (all of them less than 1 cm) (Figure 3).\nMoreover, in further repeated imaging studies, metastatic breast cancer in the brain and lungs\nremained stable without new metastatic lesions for 29 months (Figures 3 and 4). No side effects\nfrom IVIG therapy were reported, and the patient maintained a normal life. During the course, the\npatient did not receive palliative chemotherapy or targeted therapy for breast cancer.\n\nDISCUSSION\nOf all subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer has the worst prognosis and\nthe highest likelihood of recurrence. Published data suggest that metastatic triple-negative\nbreast cancer has a median survival of approximately 1 year [8] and a 5-year survival rate of\n12% [9]. This is the first known case of sustained tumor stabilization from IVIG treatment\nalone in an advanced triple-negative breast cancer patient with lung and brain metastases.\nWithout any anticancer therapy, IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer\nand metastases in the lungs and brain. This therapy provided a prolonged progressionfree survival time of at least 29 months in our patient with metastatic triple-negative breast\ncancer. This extraordinary outcome suggests that IVIG may be an alternative therapy for\nbreast cancer.\nClinical experience with IVIG for patients with cancer is scarce, but beneficial antimetastatic\neffects have been described in several animal studies [5-7,10]. In mouse models of melanoma\nand sarcoma, the administration of IVIG significantly inhibited cancer progression and\nprolonged survival [10]. A similar effect was reported in a mouse model of sarcoma\n[7]. Recently, Xu et al. [11] demonstrated that low-dose IgG might induce macrophage\npolarization toward the M1 profile, and it was effective in suppressing tumor progression in\nmouse models of three cancer types (melanoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer).\nhttps://ejbc.kr\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8\n\n255\n\n\fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nFigure 4.

The red arrows indicated the metastatic brain lesions.\nMR = magnetic resonance; IVIG = intravenous immunoglobulin; WBRT = whole brain radiotherapy.\n\nThe antimetastatic effects and safety of IVIG have been reported. In one case report, a patient\nwith malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor received IVIG (0.4 g/kg) once every 6 weeks for\nmultiple sclerosis and had a stable disease status for 30 months [7]. In another case report,\na patient with metastatic melanoma receiving high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) experienced liver\nmetastasis regression and stabilization of lung metastases for 9 months [5]. In a third report,\nnine patients with metastatic melanoma who failed prior chemotherapy and immunotherapy\nwere treated with IVIG therapy (1 g/kg) every 3 weeks [6]. Two of the patients achieved stable\ndisease status for 3 and 8 months, respectively, but the metastases progressed thereafter. To\nour knowledge, no other clinical reports have illustrated the substantial antimetastatic effect\nof IVIG therapy on solid tumors. In our case, a patient with metastatic breast cancer receiving\nonly IVIG therapy achieved stable disease status for more than 2 years. This indicates that\nIVIG therapy may improve the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage cancer and has great\npotential for metastatic solid tumor treatment.\nhttps://ejbc.kr\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.4048/jbc.2022.25.e8\n\n256\n\n\fIntravenous Immunoglobulin Suppressed Progression of Advanced Breast Cancer\n\nThe mechanisms by which IVIG inhibits metastasis progression are multifactorial and\nnot fully understood. IVIG may halt tumor progression by inducing tumor cell apoptosis\n[4,12]. IVIG was observed to enhance the apoptotic gene expression of p53, p21, and pRb\nin cancer cells and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation [3]. IVIG also induces interleukin-12\nand transforming growth factor-β secretion, which potentiates natural killer cell activity\nand increases anticancer effects. Antiangiogenic effects and activity against tumor\nadhesion machinery have also been proposed [10]. IVIG protects the basement membrane\nand intercellular matrix integrity and prevents cell invasion by decreasing matrix\nmetalloproteinase-9 mRNA expression and protein levels [7]. F(ab')2 fragments from IVIG\nhave an affinity for binding to cancer cells and initiating antibody-dependent cell-mediated\ncytotoxicity [13]. Domínguez-Soto et al. observed that the dissemination of tumors depends\non tumor-associated macrophages (M2), and IVIG could inhibit this process by modulating\ncytokines and inducing M2 (protumoral)-to-M1 (antitumoral) polarization [14].\nThe current study showed that IVIG treatment suppressed the progression of breast cancer\nand metastases in the lungs and brain without any anticancer therapy, except for whole-brain\nradiotherapy. Although whole-brain radiotherapy may have contributed to the progression\nof brain metastases, it is noteworthy that a previous study reported that the intracranial\nprogression-free duration was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5–8.5 months)\nin patients with multiple brain metastases [15]. Furthermore, the median survival after a\ndiagnosis of brain metastases in patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy was 3.6\nmonths (95% CI, 1.5–8.9 months) [16]. In another retrospective study, the median survival\nfor patients with brain metastases who received whole-brain radiotherapy was 4.2 months\n[17]. Consequently, the improved survival might not be entirely attributable to wholebrain radiotherapy. It is possible that both IVIG and whole-brain radiotherapy provided a\nsynergistic or additive effect on the stabilization of brain metastases. The effect of IVIG\ntherapy and radiation therapy on brain metastases should be considered in further long-term\nfollow-up studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer.\nIn conclusion, we report the first case of metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and brain that\nwas incidentally stabilized by IVIG treatment. The administration of IVIG may play a role in\nsuppressing tumor progression and metastasis with few side effects in patients with solid tumors.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Kistangari G, McCrae KR.
