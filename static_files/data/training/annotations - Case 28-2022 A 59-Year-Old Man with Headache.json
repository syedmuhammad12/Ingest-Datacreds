Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this\nhospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction.\nTen months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to\n38.9°C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both\ncheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea,\nand he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8°C, the\nheart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and\nthe maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination\nwas normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and\nglobulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet\ncount was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal.\nAmoxicillin–clavulanate was prescribed.\nDuring the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and\nhip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care\nphysician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain\nthat caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination\nwas unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an\ninterferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were\nscreening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was\nreferred to a rheumatologist at another hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and\nmaxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tender-\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\fCase Records of the Massachuset ts Gener al Hospital\n\nness; the remainder of the examination was\nnormal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference\nrange, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive\nprotein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference\nvalue, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor\n24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and\nthe blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter\n(reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed\nno granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted.\nA diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made,\nand treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated.\nThe next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache\nwith scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was\n55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level\n84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated.\nDuring the next 6 weeks, another attempt was\nmade to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week\nof treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and\n5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation),\nthe patient reported headache that he described\nas “the worst headache of my life,” with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst\nat the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the\nentire right side of the face, including the scalp\nand neck, was affected. The patient returned to\nthe other hospital for evaluation. He was found\nto have palsies of the third and sixth cranial\nnerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\ntesting revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value,\n<1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not\ndetected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were\nnormal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) of the head (Fig. 1A and 1B), performed\nafter the administration of intravenous contrast\nmaterial, revealed abnormal expansion and en-\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and\nright pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal\npachymeningeal thickening and enhancement\nof the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of\nthe cervical spine (Fig. 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2–C4\nwith an anterior predominance as well as more\ncircumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction\n(C6–T3) with a posterior predominance, with\nresultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7–T2. There was no spinal cord\nedema.\nDr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded.\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was\n65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference\nrange, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol\nper liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per\ndeciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red\ncells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram’s\nstaining and cultures of the CSF were negative.\nTests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensinconverting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein–Barr\nvirus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as\nwas a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test.\nCytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed\npopulation of mononuclear cells with rare plasma\ncells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg\nper deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands.\nOn the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose\nprednisone was started, and the patient was\ndischarged home. During the next 2 weeks, the\npatient continued taking the prednisone, but the\nfacial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of\ntreatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone.\nPathological examination of the meningeal\nbiopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic,\nchronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B\nlymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+\nplasma cells per high-power field.

Some of the inflammatory\nfoci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was\npresent. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells\nbut no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related\ndisease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a\npulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treat-\n\nA\n\nC\n\nment with apixaban was initiated.

Treatment with dexamethasone was\ncontinued, and the patient was discharged home.\nThree weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again\nto the other hospital because of streptococcal\ninfection. Two months after discharge, and 10\nmonths after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of\nthis hospital for additional evaluation.\nThe patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden\nmutation. Medications included apixaban, baclofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin,\nlisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired\nbusinessman and lived with his wife. He drank\none glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking\nmore than 40 years before the current evaluation.\nHis maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.\nThe temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 88\nbeats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg,\nand the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient\nwas breathing ambient air. The body-mass index\n(the weight in kilograms divided by the square\nof the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair\nwas thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the\nface, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and\nproximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs.\nThere was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He\nhad no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the\nnasal examination showed no crusting. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no\narthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic\nexaminations were normal. The complete blood\ncount and the differential count were normal,\nas was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein\nelectrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg\nper deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334) and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was\nnegative.\nA diagnosis and management decisions\nwere made.\n\nDiffer en t i a l Di agnosis\nDr. David Jayne: This 59-year-old man’s illness\nbegan with fever, sweats, rhinorrhea, and maxillary tenderness, and he was presumably treated\nfor sinusitis. The development of headache, jaw\n\n1026\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nsoreness, scalp tenderness, polymyalgia, diplopia, and marked elevations in the erythrocyte\nsedimentation rate and the level of C-reactive\nprotein prompted a temporal artery biopsy that\nled to a diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis and\ntreatment with prednisone. After an initial response, symptoms returned when prednisone\nwas tapered to a lower dose. Despite the addition of tocilizumab treatment, headache persisted\nwhen prednisone was again tapered. Third and\nsixth cranial nerve palsies developed, and the\npatient was noted to have a low positive titer on\nANCA testing, directed against myeloperoxidase.\nEvidence of pachymeningitis was observed on\nMRI, and a meningeal biopsy revealed many\nIgG4+ plasma cells; these findings prompted a\nchange in the diagnosis to IgG4-related disease.\nPachymeningitis\n\nPachymeningitis describes a disease that is characterized by thickening of the intracranial dura\nmater, which on MRI can show gadolinium enhancement caused by inflammation. Pachymeningitis is a central feature of this patient’s presentation; it accounts for the headache, cranial\nneuropathies, and spinal stenosis, and it progressed despite substantial immunosuppression\nwith rituximab and glucocorticoid therapy. The\ndifferential diagnosis for pachymeningitis includes primary vasculitis syndromes, nonvasculitic chronic inflammatory disease, infection,\nand cancer. Evaluation of extracranial features\nof a patient’s disease and histologic examination\nof a meningeal biopsy specimen are necessary to\ndetermine the diagnosis that is responsible for\nthe syndrome.1,2\nInfection and cancer have been ruled out in\nthis patient on the basis of appropriate microbiologic and histologic studies, and there are no\nclinical or histologic features supportive of histiocytosis. The diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disease includes the integration of clinical\nand radiologic features with serologic tests and\npathological examination of tissue-biopsy specimens, as well as careful observation over time\nwith respect to treatment response. Many inflammatory diseases do not have diagnostic\ncriteria, but consensus definitions and classification systems can aid in diagnosis.3,4 This patient had received diagnoses of two different\ninflammatory diseases: giant-cell arteritis and\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\fCase Records of the Massachuset ts Gener al Hospital\n\nIgG4-related disease.

In addition, the When features of both diseases occur simultanefindings of the temporal artery biopsy included ously, it is more likely that the true diagnosis\nnecrotizing arteritis of a small adjacent blood is one or the other, rather than the presence of\nvessel, and necrosis is not a typical feature of both diseases in the same patient.\ngiant-cell arteritis.\nGranulomatosis with Polyangiitis\nIgG4-Related Disease\n\nIgG4-related disease has a diverse range of clinical presentations, and histologic features include\ndense, storiform fibrosis with IgG4+ plasma\ncells and obliterative venulitis.6 Circulating IgG4\nlevels are often elevated. The levels of IgG subclasses were normal in this patient, although\nthey were measured after months of treatment\nwith glucocorticoid therapy, which may have affected the results. Pachymeningitis is a known\nfeature of IgG4-related disease.2 However, the\nseverity of this patient’s inflammatory presentation, which was marked by fever and night\nsweats, would be highly unusual for IgG4-related\ndisease, as would the patient’s poor response to\nboth oral and intravenous glucocorticoids. Patients with IgG4-related disease typically have a\ngood response to prednisone.\nThe results of this patient’s temporal artery\nand meningeal biopsies are also helpful when\nconsidering the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. IgG4+ plasma cells would have been expected to be present in the temporal artery–biopsy\nspecimen if IgG4-related disease were affecting\nthe temporal artery, but these cells were not seen\nin this patient’s specimen.7 The meningeal biopsy\nrevealed storiform fibrosis, obliterative venulitis,\nand IgG4+ plasma cells, but these findings are\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nGPA has been defined as a necrotizing, granulomatous inflammation of small and mediumsized blood vessels of the respiratory tract that\noften also affects the kidneys.11 The inflammatory features seen in this patient are consistent\nwith this diagnosis, and both facial pain and\nmaxillary tenderness are also common with\nGPA. The absence of findings in the lungs and\nkidneys would make this an unusual case of\nGPA, but such cases occur. Presentations that\nare limited to the head and neck, including hypertrophic pachymeningitis, are well described\nin patients with GPA.\nGPA is closely associated with one of two\nautoantibodies directed against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens: either proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase. This patient had a positive test for\nantibodies to myeloperoxidase, albeit at a relatively low level. ANCA assays remain poorly\nstandardized, and their diagnostic performance\ndepends on both the pretest probability of disease and laboratory expertise.12 In addition, the\ntiter in this patient may have been reduced by\nthe preceding 6 weeks of treatment with prednisone.\nThe necrotizing inflammation of the small\nartery that was seen in the temporal artery biopsy\nand the presence of giant cells with areas of\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n1027\n\n\fT h e n e w e ng l a n d j o u r na l o f m e dic i n e\n\nnecrosis in the meningeal biopsy are consistent\nwith GPA. Moreover, infiltrations of IgG4+\nplasma cells are often detected in this disease.13\nGPA is initially responsive to glucocorticoids,\nbut remission requires treatment with either the\ncytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide or the B-cell–\ndepleting antibody rituximab. Rituximab takes\ntime to work and would not yet have been effective within the 2 weeks after treatment, when\nthis patient’s radiologic findings had progressed\nand clinical deterioration had occurred.\n\nDr . Dav id Ja y ne’s Di agnosis\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\nPathol o gic a l Discussion\nDr. James R. Stone: The specimens from the temporal artery and meningeal biopsies that were\nperformed at the other hospital were reviewed.\nThe temporal artery–biopsy specimen (Fig. 3)\nshowed necrotizing vasculitis involving a branch\nartery. The main temporal artery was not involved. There was both fibrinoid necrosis and\nluminal thrombosis of the branch artery. Focal\ninvolvement of small veins, which indicated a\nsmall-vessel vasculitis, was also observed. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the\ninflammatory infiltrate was composed primarily\nof CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells,\nand CD68+ macrophages.\nAlthough the temporal artery biopsy showed\nvasculitis, and giant-cell arteritis is by far the\nmost common form of vasculitis to affect this\nsite, in up to 6% of temporal artery biopsies that\nconfirm the presence of vasculitis, the vasculitis\nis due to a form other than giant-cell arteritis.14-16\nThe use of the term “temporal arteritis” to describe temporal artery biopsies with evidence of\nvasculitis should be avoided because this construct inadvertently implies giant-cell arteritis.\nSeveral histologic features of the temporal artery–\nbiopsy specimen from this patient were unusual for giant-cell arteritis: the finding of arteritis being confined primarily to a branch\nartery, the presence of both fibrinoid necrosis\nand luminal thrombosis, and the degree of plasmacell infiltration. Moreover, venous involvement\nimplicates a small-vessel vasculitis (e.g., an ANCAassociated vasculitis or an immune complex–\nmediated vasculitis).17 Although IgG4-related\n\n1028\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\ndisease can be associated with vasculitis in both\nsmall and large vessels, necrotizing small-vessel\nvasculitis is not a feature of IgG4-related disease.7,18 Taken together, the findings of the temporal artery biopsy were not consistent with\ngiant-cell arteritis or IgG4-related disease.\nThe meningeal biopsy specimen showed a\ndiffuse inflammatory infiltrate that was similar\nto that seen in the temporal artery–biopsy\nspecimen; the infiltrate was composed primarily\nof CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells,\nand CD68+ macrophages (Fig. 4). Relatively few\nCD20+ B lymphocytes were present, and the\nplasma cells showed polytypic expression for\nkappa and lambda immunoglobin light chains\n(not shown). There were occasional multinucleated giant cells, which indicated granulomatous\ninflammation, as well as areas with neutrophils\nand necrosis (often termed microabscesses). Storiform fibrosis and obliterative venulitis, which\nwere reported at the other hospital and can be\nseen in some cases of IgG4-related disease, were\nnot identified. Staining for microorganisms was\nnegative. There were more than 100 IgG4+\nplasma cells per high-power field; 49% of the\nIgG+ plasma cells showed expression of IgG4.\nThe diffuse nature of the meningeal infiltrate\nwas not consistent with a focused vasculitis such\nas giant-cell arteritis. The degree of IgG4+\nplasma cell infiltration would meet the criteria\nfor IgG4-related disease in the appropriate context; however, giant cells and neutrophilic microabscesses are not features of IgG4-related disease.18 Diffuse inflammation with giant cells\nand neutrophilic microabscesses are features of\nGPA.19 Biopsy specimens from patients with GPA\nmay also show a high degree of tissue infiltration by IgG4+ plasma cells.20 Taken together,\nthis case of vasculitis affecting both the temporal artery and the meninges is most consistent\nwith the diagnosis of GPA.\n\nPathol o gic a l Di agnosis\nArteritis involving the temporal artery and pachymeningitis associated with granulomatosis with\npolyangiitis.\n\nDiscussion of M a nagemen t\nDr. John Stone: The treatment of GPA generally\nrequires at least two drug therapies — not gluco-\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\fCase Records of the Massachuset ts Gener al Hospital\n\nB\n\nA\n\n*\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nFigure 3.

Although circulating B cells are no longer detected\nafter even just one 1000-mg dose of rituximab in\nmost cases, such patients are not truly “B-cell–\ndepleted.” The ability to gauge the depth of B-cell\ndepletion with the use of conventional flow cytometry is poor, and assays that are currently available for routine clinical purposes provide no precise indication of the extent that the B-lymphocyte\npool has been affected. Decisions about when to\nreadminister B-cell–depleting agents are largely\nempirical. For this patient with disease that was\nparticularly refractory to remission induction,\nwe administered a third dose of rituximab, followed by a fourth dose 4 months later. Excellent\ndisease control was achieved with this regimen.\nThe glucocorticoids were tapered off after several months, and he remains in complete remission under close monitoring. However, more than\n1 year after remission had been achieved and\nglucocorticoids had been discontinued entirely,\nthe patient began to have avascular necrosis of\nboth hips and the left shoulder, long-term complications of the intensive glucocorticoid therapy\nused early in his clinical course.\n\nby streptococcal infection. Although his condition appeared to be stable in the rheumatology\nclinic on the day we met, the speed of his earlier neurologic deterioration suggested that\ncontrol of the disease was tenuous and that\nconsolidation therapy was warranted.

Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this\nhospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction.\nTen months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to\n38.9°C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both\ncheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea,\nand he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8°C, the\nheart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and\nthe maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination\nwas normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and\nglobulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet\ncount was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal.\nAmoxicillin–clavulanate was prescribed.\nDuring the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain continued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and\nhip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care\nphysician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain\nthat caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination\nwas unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an\ninterferon-γ release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were\nscreening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radiography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was\nreferred to a rheumatologist at another hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and\nmaxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tender-\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\fCase Records of the Massachuset ts Gener al Hospital\n\nness; the remainder of the examination was\nnormal, including the absence of bruits on auscultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference\nrange, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive\nprotein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference\nvalue, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor\n24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and\nthe blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter\n(reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right temporal artery was performed. Histologic examination of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed\nno granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflammation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid necrosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted.\nA diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made,\nand treatment with prednisone was started. Within a few days after initiation of treatment, headache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated.\nThe next month, an attempt to lower the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache\nwith scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was\n55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level\n84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutaneous administration of tocilizumab was initiated.\nDuring the next 6 weeks, another attempt was\nmade to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week\nof treatment at a lower prednisone dose, and\n5 months after the development of initial symptoms (5 months before the current evaluation),\nthe patient reported headache that he described\nas “the worst headache of my life,” with associated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain was worst\nat the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the\nentire right side of the face, including the scalp\nand neck, was affected. The patient returned to\nthe other hospital for evaluation. He was found\nto have palsies of the third and sixth cranial\nnerves on the right side. The patient was admitted to the neurology service at the other hospital. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\ntesting revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxidase antibody level, at 1.9 U (reference value,\n<1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not\ndetected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were\nnormal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) of the head (Fig. 1A and 1B), performed\nafter the administration of intravenous contrast\nmaterial, revealed abnormal expansion and en-\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nhancement of the right cavernous sinus that extended into the right superior orbital fissure and\nright pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal\npachymeningeal thickening and enhancement\nof the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of\nthe cervical spine (Fig. 1C and 1D) showed masslike pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2–C4\nwith an anterior predominance as well as more\ncircumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction\n(C6–T3) with a posterior predominance, with\nresultant canal narrowing and mild cord compression at C7–T2. There was no spinal cord\nedema.\nDr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded.\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was\n65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference\nrange, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol\nper liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per\ndeciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red\ncells per microliter and 8 white cells per microliter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram’s\nstaining and cultures of the CSF were negative.\nTests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensinconverting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysticercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein–Barr\nvirus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as\nwas a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test.\nCytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed\npopulation of mononuclear cells with rare plasma\ncells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg\nper deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligoclonal bands.\nOn the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose\nprednisone was started, and the patient was\ndischarged home. During the next 2 weeks, the\npatient continued taking the prednisone, but the\nfacial and head pain worsened. He was readmitted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of\ntreatment with parenteral pulse-dose methylprednisolone.\nPathological examination of the meningeal\nbiopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic,\nchronically inflamed dura mater with large numbers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B\nlymphocytes. There was a large number of polyclonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+\nplasma cells per high-power field.

Some of the inflammatory\nfoci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was\npresent. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necrosis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells\nbut no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related\ndisease was made, and rituximab was administered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a\npulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treat-\n\nA\n\nC\n\nment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks\nlater, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate\nthe treatment response.\nDr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head (Fig. 2A\nand 2B), performed after the administration of\nintravenous contrast material, revealed increased\nabnormal enhancement in the right cavernous\nsinus and right middle cranial fossa and new abnormal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus\n\nB\n\nD\n\nFigure 1.

There was also progression of\nthe canal stenosis, which had become severe,\nand cord compression at the C7 level. There was\nno cord signal abnormality.\nDr. John Stone: The patient received a second in-\n\nA\n\nC\n\nfusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral\ndexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months\nafter the development of initial symptoms (3\nmonths before the current evaluation), the patient was admitted to the other hospital because\nof worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nExamination was notable for new sensorineural\nhearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the\ntongue to the left.

Treatment with dexamethasone was\ncontinued, and the patient was discharged home.\nThree weeks after placement of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again\nto the other hospital because of streptococcal\ninfection. Two months after discharge, and 10\nmonths after the development of initial symptoms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of\nthis hospital for additional evaluation.\nThe patient had a history of migraines, hypertension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden\nmutation. Medications included apixaban, baclofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin,\nlisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired\nbusinessman and lived with his wife. He drank\none glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking\nmore than 40 years before the current evaluation.\nHis maternal grandfather had died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm.\nThe temperature was 36.5°C, the heart rate 88\nbeats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg,\nand the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient\nwas breathing ambient air. The body-mass index\n(the weight in kilograms divided by the square\nof the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair\nwas thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the\nface, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and\nproximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs.\nThere was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He\nhad no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the\nnasal examination showed no crusting. Extraocular movements were intact. There was no\narthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic\nexaminations were normal. The complete blood\ncount and the differential count were normal,\nas was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein\nelectrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg\nper deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334) and normal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was\nnegative.\nA diagnosis and management decisions\nwere made.\n\nDiffer en t i a l Di agnosis\nDr. David Jayne: This 59-year-old man’s illness\nbegan with fever, sweats, rhinorrhea, and maxillary tenderness, and he was presumably treated\nfor sinusitis.

After an initial response, symptoms returned when prednisone\nwas tapered to a lower dose. Despite the addition of tocilizumab treatment, headache persisted\nwhen prednisone was again tapered. Third and\nsixth cranial nerve palsies developed, and the\npatient was noted to have a low positive titer on\nANCA testing, directed against myeloperoxidase.\nEvidence of pachymeningitis was observed on\nMRI, and a meningeal biopsy revealed many\nIgG4+ plasma cells; these findings prompted a\nchange in the diagnosis to IgG4-related disease.\nPachymeningitis\n\nPachymeningitis describes a disease that is characterized by thickening of the intracranial dura\nmater, which on MRI can show gadolinium enhancement caused by inflammation. Pachymeningitis is a central feature of this patient’s presentation; it accounts for the headache, cranial\nneuropathies, and spinal stenosis, and it progressed despite substantial immunosuppression\nwith rituximab and glucocorticoid therapy. The\ndifferential diagnosis for pachymeningitis includes primary vasculitis syndromes, nonvasculitic chronic inflammatory disease, infection,\nand cancer. Evaluation of extracranial features\nof a patient’s disease and histologic examination\nof a meningeal biopsy specimen are necessary to\ndetermine the diagnosis that is responsible for\nthe syndrome.1,2\nInfection and cancer have been ruled out in\nthis patient on the basis of appropriate microbiologic and histologic studies, and there are no\nclinical or histologic features supportive of histiocytosis. The diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disease includes the integration of clinical\nand radiologic features with serologic tests and\npathological examination of tissue-biopsy specimens, as well as careful observation over time\nwith respect to treatment response. Many inflammatory diseases do not have diagnostic\ncriteria, but consensus definitions and classification systems can aid in diagnosis.3,4 This patient had received diagnoses of two different\ninflammatory diseases: giant-cell arteritis and\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\fCase Records of the Massachuset ts Gener al Hospital\n\nIgG4-related disease.

In addition, the When features of both diseases occur simultanefindings of the temporal artery biopsy included ously, it is more likely that the true diagnosis\nnecrotizing arteritis of a small adjacent blood is one or the other, rather than the presence of\nvessel, and necrosis is not a typical feature of both diseases in the same patient.\ngiant-cell arteritis.\nGranulomatosis with Polyangiitis\nIgG4-Related Disease\n\nIgG4-related disease has a diverse range of clinical presentations, and histologic features include\ndense, storiform fibrosis with IgG4+ plasma\ncells and obliterative venulitis.6 Circulating IgG4\nlevels are often elevated. The levels of IgG subclasses were normal in this patient, although\nthey were measured after months of treatment\nwith glucocorticoid therapy, which may have affected the results. Pachymeningitis is a known\nfeature of IgG4-related disease.2 However, the\nseverity of this patient’s inflammatory presentation, which was marked by fever and night\nsweats, would be highly unusual for IgG4-related\ndisease, as would the patient’s poor response to\nboth oral and intravenous glucocorticoids. Patients with IgG4-related disease typically have a\ngood response to prednisone.\nThe results of this patient’s temporal artery\nand meningeal biopsies are also helpful when\nconsidering the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. IgG4+ plasma cells would have been expected to be present in the temporal artery–biopsy\nspecimen if IgG4-related disease were affecting\nthe temporal artery, but these cells were not seen\nin this patient’s specimen.7 The meningeal biopsy\nrevealed storiform fibrosis, obliterative venulitis,\nand IgG4+ plasma cells, but these findings are\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\nGPA has been defined as a necrotizing, granulomatous inflammation of small and mediumsized blood vessels of the respiratory tract that\noften also affects the kidneys.11 The inflammatory features seen in this patient are consistent\nwith this diagnosis, and both facial pain and\nmaxillary tenderness are also common with\nGPA. The absence of findings in the lungs and\nkidneys would make this an unusual case of\nGPA, but such cases occur. Presentations that\nare limited to the head and neck, including hypertrophic pachymeningitis, are well described\nin patients with GPA.\nGPA is closely associated with one of two\nautoantibodies directed against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens: either proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase. This patient had a positive test for\nantibodies to myeloperoxidase, albeit at a relatively low level. ANCA assays remain poorly\nstandardized, and their diagnostic performance\ndepends on both the pretest probability of disease and laboratory expertise.12 In addition, the\ntiter in this patient may have been reduced by\nthe preceding 6 weeks of treatment with prednisone.\nThe necrotizing inflammation of the small\nartery that was seen in the temporal artery biopsy\nand the presence of giant cells with areas of\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n1027\n\n\fT h e n e w e ng l a n d j o u r na l o f m e dic i n e\n\nnecrosis in the meningeal biopsy are consistent\nwith GPA. Moreover, infiltrations of IgG4+\nplasma cells are often detected in this disease.13\nGPA is initially responsive to glucocorticoids,\nbut remission requires treatment with either the\ncytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide or the B-cell–\ndepleting antibody rituximab. Rituximab takes\ntime to work and would not yet have been effective within the 2 weeks after treatment, when\nthis patient’s radiologic findings had progressed\nand clinical deterioration had occurred.\n\nDr .

Stone: The specimens from the temporal artery and meningeal biopsies that were\nperformed at the other hospital were reviewed.\nThe temporal artery–biopsy specimen (Fig. 3)\nshowed necrotizing vasculitis involving a branch\nartery. The main temporal artery was not involved. There was both fibrinoid necrosis and\nluminal thrombosis of the branch artery. Focal\ninvolvement of small veins, which indicated a\nsmall-vessel vasculitis, was also observed. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the\ninflammatory infiltrate was composed primarily\nof CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells,\nand CD68+ macrophages.\nAlthough the temporal artery biopsy showed\nvasculitis, and giant-cell arteritis is by far the\nmost common form of vasculitis to affect this\nsite, in up to 6% of temporal artery biopsies that\nconfirm the presence of vasculitis, the vasculitis\nis due to a form other than giant-cell arteritis.14-16\nThe use of the term “temporal arteritis” to describe temporal artery biopsies with evidence of\nvasculitis should be avoided because this construct inadvertently implies giant-cell arteritis.\nSeveral histologic features of the temporal artery–\nbiopsy specimen from this patient were unusual for giant-cell arteritis: the finding of arteritis being confined primarily to a branch\nartery, the presence of both fibrinoid necrosis\nand luminal thrombosis, and the degree of plasmacell infiltration. Moreover, venous involvement\nimplicates a small-vessel vasculitis (e.g., an ANCAassociated vasculitis or an immune complex–\nmediated vasculitis).17 Although IgG4-related\n\n1028\n\nn engl j med 387;11\n\ndisease can be associated with vasculitis in both\nsmall and large vessels, necrotizing small-vessel\nvasculitis is not a feature of IgG4-related disease.7,18 Taken together, the findings of the temporal artery biopsy were not consistent with\ngiant-cell arteritis or IgG4-related disease.\nThe meningeal biopsy specimen showed a\ndiffuse inflammatory infiltrate that was similar\nto that seen in the temporal artery–biopsy\nspecimen; the infiltrate was composed primarily\nof CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells,\nand CD68+ macrophages (Fig. 4). Relatively few\nCD20+ B lymphocytes were present, and the\nplasma cells showed polytypic expression for\nkappa and lambda immunoglobin light chains\n(not shown). There were occasional multinucleated giant cells, which indicated granulomatous\ninflammation, as well as areas with neutrophils\nand necrosis (often termed microabscesses). Storiform fibrosis and obliterative venulitis, which\nwere reported at the other hospital and can be\nseen in some cases of IgG4-related disease, were\nnot identified. Staining for microorganisms was\nnegative. There were more than 100 IgG4+\nplasma cells per high-power field; 49% of the\nIgG+ plasma cells showed expression of IgG4.\nThe diffuse nature of the meningeal infiltrate\nwas not consistent with a focused vasculitis such\nas giant-cell arteritis. The degree of IgG4+\nplasma cell infiltration would meet the criteria\nfor IgG4-related disease in the appropriate context; however, giant cells and neutrophilic microabscesses are not features of IgG4-related disease.18 Diffuse inflammation with giant cells\nand neutrophilic microabscesses are features of\nGPA.19 Biopsy specimens from patients with GPA\nmay also show a high degree of tissue infiltration by IgG4+ plasma cells.20 Taken together,\nthis case of vasculitis affecting both the temporal artery and the meninges is most consistent\nwith the diagnosis of GPA.\n\nPathol o gic a l Di agnosis\nArteritis involving the temporal artery and pachymeningitis associated with granulomatosis with\npolyangiitis.\n\nDiscussion of M a nagemen t\nDr. John Stone: The treatment of GPA generally\nrequires at least two drug therapies — not gluco-\n\nnejm.org\n\nSeptember 15, 2022\n\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n\n\fCase Records of the Massachuset ts Gener al Hospital\n\nB\n\nA\n\n*\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nFigure 3.
