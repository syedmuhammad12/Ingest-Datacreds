Remdesivir is currently the only\nantiviral to achieve FDA approval to treat hospitalized patients with Covid-19 and hypoxemia\n[6], when administered early it is highly efficacious [7]. Despite this approach, the emergence of\nOmicron variants has been associated with increased acquisition and prolonged viral illness in\nimmunocompromised patients. When progression to LRTI occurs after the first week of\nsymptoms patients are no longer eligible for EUA-available therapeutics.\n\nD\n\nM\n\nA\n\nNirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) is a combination antiviral with nirmatrelvir, a direct-acting 3CL\nprotease inhibitor, and ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor without direct antiviral activity.\nOutpatient clinical trials have shown high efficacy when used early in infection [8]. Studies in\npatients hospitalized with severe infection or patients with prolonged infection have not been\nperformed.\n\nTE\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA\n\nCC\n\nEP\n\nA 40-year-old man with B-cell ALL received rituximab and hyper-CVAD in 2021 with complete\nremission and no evidence of minimal residual disease after 6 months and 8 cycles of treatment\nincluding 8 infusions of rituximab, 375mg/m2 in 2021. He had transitioned to maintenance\nchemotherapy in December 2021 when multiple family members developed polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR)-proven Covid-19. He received prophylactic casivirimab and imdevimab (RegenCov). He experienced rhinorrhea and did not present for care, but at 20 days after exposure a\nnares swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 106 copies/ml [9] and chemotherapy was held\n(Figure 1a). A week later he presented to his local hospital with fevers and cough and received\nsotrovimab (Figure 1b). Over the next six weeks he was admitted three times to his local\nhospital with fever and hypoxemia. With each hospitalization he received steroids to treat\nworsening pulmonary infiltrates which were initially multifocal and dense but evolved into\ndiffuse, ground glass opacities (GGO) and interstitial disease; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was\nnot performed but nares swabs were positive (Figure 1c). In mid-March he was admitted to our\nhospital with oxygen saturations <90% and nares swab again positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chest\nCT showed diffuse GGO, consistent with viral LRTI. Sequencing revealed variant of concern\n(VOC) BA.1.1, consistent with a nares sample from February (Figure 1d). He received 10 days\n\nDOI: 10.1093/cid/ciac868\n\n2\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac868/6795102 by guest on 19 November 2022\n\nImmunocompromised individuals, especially those with hematological malignancies, have an\nelevated risk of prolonged infection, clinical failure of available therapeutics, progressive lower\nrespiratory tract infection (LRTI) and mortality far in excess of age-matched immune competent\npersons [1,2]. Prolonged infection is associated with within-host viral evolution and represents a\nsource of global variants [3–5].\n\n\fof IV remdesivir and a dexamethasone taper (Figure 1b). He remained on 2-4L of supplemental\noxygen by nasal cannula (NC) but was afebrile and discharged home.\n\nSC\nRI\nPT\n\nU\n\nN\n\nTE\n\nD\n\nM\n\nA\n\nThe patient’s hypoxemia resolved quickly after initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir on HD6. Nares\nswab SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative on HD7 and serum PCR on HD8. By HD14 he was\nweaned off supplemental oxygen and chest CT showed persistent but improved areas of GGO\n(Figure 1c). To further investigate whether GGO persistence was related to COVID or\norganizing pneumonia, repeat bronchoscopy was performed on HD15. SARS-CoV-2 was again\ndetected in BAL, though at much lower concentration (104 copies/ ml). BAL fluid\ngalactomannan decreased to 0.5. Serum nucleocapsid antibodies were undetectable.\n\nA\n\nCC\n\nEP\n\nIn the first week after hospital discharge his oxygen requirement recurred and he was treated\nwith nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for an additional 10 days via eIND extension and a second dose of\nsotrovimab, also under eIND, due to persistent BA.1.1 virus. By day 20 of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir\nhe was off oxygen. He tolerated twenty days of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir well, only reporting\nabdominal bloating. No laboratory abnormalities arose during treatment and the transaminase\nelevation, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia observed during his viral illness resolved. Chest\nCT one week after completion of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir revealed substantial improvement with\nno suggestion of IPA (Figure 1c). Prednisone taper was completed 10 days after discontinuation\nof nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Isavuconazole was used in place of ambisome after cessation of\nritonavir to prevent IPA and was stopped after discontinuation of prednisone. At 4 months after\ndiscontinuation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir he is clinically stable without evidence of recrudescent\ninfections.\nWhole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing of nares and BAL fluid samples revealed a consistent\nBA.1.1 sequence without evidence of novel SARS-CoV-2 exposures (Figure 1d) [10]. The first\nnasopharyngeal sample sequenced from 2 months after virus acquisition revealed changes\n\nDOI: 10.1093/cid/ciac868\n\n3\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac868/6795102 by guest on 19 November 2022\n\nAt completion of the dexamethasone taper in early April he again developed cough, fevers, and\ndyspnea and had an oxygen saturation in the mid-70s on 3L supplemental oxygen with\ntemperature >39C. On admission, nares swab was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1a)\nbut chest imaging by CT was slightly improved (Figure 1c). Off steroids, he required 8-10L by\nNC of supplemental oxygen at rest to 10-15L by face mask with exertion or sleep on hospital day\n(HD) 3-5. Fluid from BAL on HD3 was positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 107 copies/ml. BAL fluid\ngalactomannan was 1.1 (confirmation 0.8), with no mold detected by PCR or in culture.\nPneumocystis stain by direct fluorescent antibody was negative. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by\nPCR in serum. He was diagnosed with persistent SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with viremia. He was\nstarted on IV remdesivir with prednisone at 0.5mg/kg and ambisome at 5mg/kg on HD4 due to\npotential contributions of organizing pneumonia and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). He\ncontinued to require supplemental oxygen of 4-8L by NC. Sequencing from the nares and BAL\nrevealed the same BA.1.1 variant (Figure 1d). A single patient emergency investigational new\ndrug (eIND) authorization was obtained for 10 days of treatment with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.\n\n\fSC\nRI\nPT\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA\n\nN\n\nU\n\nWe present a case of prolonged, persistent, and severe lower respiratory tract Covid-19 in a\nprofoundly immunocompromised person who was cured with 20 days of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.\nWhile multiple therapies were tried, including monoclonal antibodies and IV remdesivir, the\nclinical and virological improvement we observed was most closely associated with\nnirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Virus remained detectable by BAL and oxygen requirement returned after\n10 days of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in combination with remdesivir but a full twenty days of\nnirmatrelvir/ritonavir led to sustained improvement and clinical cure.\n\nA\n\nCC\n\nEP\n\nTE\n\nD\n\nM\n\nOur case illustrates the importance of the abrogation of viral replication for effective treatment of\npersistent LRTI in the profoundly immunocompromised patient. Our patient had severe clinical\nprogression with evidence of profound respiratory insufficiency and disseminated SARS-CoV-2,\napproaching hypoxemic respiratory failure despite sotrovimab and IV remdesivir therapy. The\nSARS COV2 variant BA.1.1 was sequenced from a nares sample from February and persisted\nwith minimal changes throughout his course. Although many sequence changes are shared across\nOmicron variants BA.1 – BA.3, no BA.2-defining mutations were observed at any time point\n[10]. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from\nnares and serum, which became negative by days 2 and 3 respectively of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir\ntherapy (day 5 of his second 10-day course of IV remdesivir). A high viral load in the lower\nrespiratory tract required a longer duration of therapy: SARS-CoV-2 was still detected in the\nBAL at 104 copies/ml after 10 days of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, indicating that only partial virologic\ncontrol had been achieved. While we did not repeat BAL after 20 days to confirm lower airway\nclearance, his resumption of daily activities off supplemental oxygen and marked resolution of\ninfiltrates by chest CT provide ample evidence of the resolution of his illness after prolonged\nantivirals.\nCorticosteroids treat the inflammatory manifestations of COVID-19 including organizing\npneumonia, which presents as ground glass opacities and may be indistinguishable from viral\npneumonia. This patient may not have survived 4 months of COVID-19 LRTI without the use of\nsteroids; during his last hospitalization and prior to initiation of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, steroids\nwere held and he progressed to requiring 100% oxygen by non-rebreathing face mask over a\n\nDOI: 10.1093/cid/ciac868\n\n4\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac868/6795102 by guest on 19 November 2022\n\nassociated with resistance or escape to sotrovimab (E340D, S371F) and mutations previously\nseen at high frequency in sotrovimab-treated patients (R346K, Q493R) that were consistently\ndetected in subsequent samples [11–14]. K356T, also associated with reduced susceptibility to\nsotrovimab, was observed in the BAL sample [13]. These likely contributed to the ineffective\nclinical response associated with its administration. The sequence from BAL after 10 days of\nnirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not of sufficient quality to detect mutations that might be associated\nwith nirmatrelvir/ritonavir resistance.\n\n\fperiod of 4-5 days. However, we suspect that corticosteroids facilitated his persistent viral\ninfection and contributed to his risk of invasive fungal infection.\n\nSC\nRI\nPT\n\nU\n\nNOTES:\n\nN\n\nFunding sources: None to report\n\nM\n\nJH, JMR, and MD are employees of Pfizer.\n\nA\n\nPotential conflicts of interest:\n\nD\n\nMB receives research support from GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead, and research support and\nconsulting fees from Vir Biotechnology.\n\nTE\n\nALG reports contract testing to UW from Abbott, Cepheid, Novavax, Pfizer, Janssen and\nHologic and research support to UW from Gilead and Merck, outside of the described work.\n\nEP\n\nPR received speaking fees from Gates Foundation.\n\nCC\n\nAll other authors have no potential conflicts to disclose.\n\nReferences:\n\nA\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nZhang Y, Luo W, Li Q, et al.

In\nthis patient, a 20-day course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir led to clinical cure. Use of high dose\ncorticosteroids likely compromises the potency of antiviral therapy, but how to manage\ncorticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents in profoundly immunocompromised patients\nis not yet clear. We deeply appreciate the eIND process and the capacity to provide cure for this\npatient, but the need for expanded availability of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and clinical trials for its\nuse in profoundly immunocompromised patients, including in combination with other antivirals\nand immunomodulatory agents, is emergent.\n\n\f11.\n12.\n\n13.\n\nTE\n\n14.\n\nSC\nRI\nPT\n\n10.\n\nU\n\n9.\n\nN\n\n8.\n\nEP\n\nFIGURE LEGEND:\n\nA\n\nCC\n\nFigure 1.
