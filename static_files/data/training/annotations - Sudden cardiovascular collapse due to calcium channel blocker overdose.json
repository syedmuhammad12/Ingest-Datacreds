Management has traditionally included use of calcium (Ca), glucagon, and vasopressors (pressors). High-dose insulin euglycemic therapy (HIET) has recently been recommended for the treatment of severe CCB toxicity.\r\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 65 year-old male with atrial fibrillation presented to the ED after being found down at home. He had a GCS of 11 and shallow respirations despite administration of naloxone, and initially had normal vitals. He was found near crushed white powder and an unknown prescription bottle which was ultimately confirmed to contain 240 mg sustained-release diltiazem capsules. Initial labs showed a severe respiratory acidosis and drug screen positive for oxycodone and fentanyl. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm. He was intubated for airway protection and admitted to the ICU for suspected opioid overdose. The patient rapidly became bradycardic, hypotensive, and went into asystolic cardiac arrest. Given the hemodynamic changes preceding cardiac arrest, diltiazem toxicity was suspected. In addition to standard ACLS, 6g of Ca gluconate and 1 mg of atropine were administered, and nor-epinephrine infusion was initiated. ROSC was obtained after 4 minutes of ACLS. Immediately postarrest, the patient had a normal heart rate but was requiring three pressors. He received an additional 3g of Ca gluconate but again began developing bradycardia. The decision was made to initiate HIET. A 0.25 unit/kg bolus of regular insulin was administered, followed by an IV insulin drip at 0.5 units/kg/hr along with a dextrose infusion. The patient had no further bradycardia, and within 3 hours the vasopressor requirements began to decrease. Approximately 24 hours after initiation of HIET, pressors were stopped and HIET was discontinued. No further hemodynamic instability was observed, and the patient had a good neurological outcome.\r\nDISCUSSION: HIET in CCB toxicity is theorized to promote myocyte metabolism of carbohydrates which has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects in stressed states. An expert consensus panel recently gave a class ID recommendation for the use of HIET with other first-line treatments if there is evidence of myocardial dysfunction (1). The evidence for this recommendation is limited to observational studies, case series, and animal studies. Additional treatments for severe CCB toxicity include lipid emulsion therapy (ID) and VA-ECMO (2D)(1). Our patient showed no signs of impending cardiovascular collapse on presentation, which we attribute to the slow-release preparation of diltiazem that delays the onset of the medication effect 6-8 hours after administration.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Given the rapid improvement in our patient's hemodynamic status, our case supports the recommendation that HIET be a first-line treatment option for CCB toxicity in cases with severe cardiovascular dysfunction.\r\nReference #1: St-Onge M, Anseeuw K, Cantrell FL, et al.
