They were largely \r\nfavoured for their perceived lower profile of extrapyramidal \r\nsymptoms commonly seen with first-generation antipsychotics \r\nsuch as haloperidol, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine.1\r\nHowever, atypical antipsychotics have significant adverse \r\neffects of their own, including worsening risk of type 2 diabetes, \r\nobesity, hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease.2,3\r\nFurthermore, while antipsychotics were originally confined \r\nmainly as therapeutics for SEMI, there is broadening licence \r\nand off-licence use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with \r\nnon-schizophreniform illness, including as a treatment for \r\nresistant depression, emotionally unstable personality disorder \r\nand bipolar disorder.4\r\nWhile atypical antipsychotics are largely effective medica\u0002tions for reducing psychotic symptoms, due to pressures on \r\nsecondary care mental health services, many patients on atyp\u0002ical antipsychotics who are deemed ‘stable’ are transferred \r\nback to management solely within primary care. General prac\u0002tice teams have tended to focus mainly on the physical risk \r\nfactor management of atypical antipsychotic prescriptions, but \r\nfew GPs (an informal survey online suggests less than 10%) \r\nhave the confidence or specialist skills to consider safe reduc\u0002tion or switching of atypical antipsychotics. As such, some \r\npatients may remain on these medications for some years, \r\nperhaps for life, without further psychiatric review.5\r\nManaging patients on atypical \r\nantipsychotics in primary care\r\nALAN WOODALL \r\nAtypical antipsychotics are effective \r\ntreatments for patients with psychotic \r\ndisorders, but prolonged use can \r\nincrease the risk of long-term adverse \r\neffects such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, \r\nhyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular \r\ndisease. This article provides guidance \r\nto help GPs manage patients on these \r\nmedications, and discusses how service \r\nreconfiguration is urgently needed \r\nto improve care for patients who \r\nare currently falling through the gap \r\nbetween primary and secondary care \r\nreview. \r\nSPL\r\nwchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com Prescriber November/December 2021 ❚ 19\r\nAtypical antipsychotics l PRESCRIBING IN PRACTICE ■\r\nThis article discusses the main roles for primary care in the \r\nmanagement of risk factors associated with atypical antipsy\u0002chotics. It also raises the need for a co-ordinated strategy to \r\nensure that there is regular consideration of targeted dose \r\nreduction and withdrawal, and suggests research needed to \r\nachieve this. \r\nRise in use of atypical antipsychotics and the role \r\nof primary care\r\nAntipsychotics are widely prescribed in the general population: \r\nabout 1% of primary care patients are prescribed these medi\u0002cines at any one time.4 Some of the most common atypical \r\nantipsychotics, with their licensed and unlicensed indications, \r\nare shown in Table 1.6 Since their introduction, the use of atyp\u0002ical antipsychotics has broadened, and they are increasingly \r\nbeing favoured by some psychiatry teams as medications \r\nwhich, while effective, also allow discharge of the patient to \r\nprimary care with less blood testing. A typical example of this \r\nis the use of quetiapine monotherapy instead of lithium in the \r\nmanagement of stable bipolar disorder.7\r\nMore atypical antipsychotics are being used in treatment\u0002resistant depression and (off-licence) for mood-stabilisation in \r\npatients with emotionally unstable personality disorder. In older \r\npatients, atypical antipsychotic prescriptions are rising, espe\u0002cially in the management of dementia, despite the concerns \r\nover stroke risk and guidance from NICE that they should be \r\nused only for the shortest possible time and at the lowest pos\u0002sible dose.8 Again, with pressure on mental health services, \r\nmany patients are discharged to equally hard-pressed primary \r\ncare teams to manage and prescribe, which inadvertently trans\u0002fers prescribing risk to the primary care team; nearly one-third \r\nof atypical antipsychotics are now solely prescribed and moni\u0002tored by primary care.9\r\nAdverse effects and risk factors associated with \r\natypical antipsychotics \r\nAtypical antipsychotics are thought to exert their therapeutic \r\neffect mainly via transient ‘on-off’ blockade of the dopaminergic \r\nD2 receptor pathway, but also interact with the anticholinergic, \r\nnoradrenergic, glutaminergic and serotonergic pathways to var\u0002ying degrees, which means the risk of adverse effects is broad \r\nand often difficult to predict.10 Table 2 shows the common \r\nadverse effects of these medications and their relative \r\nrisks.11,12\r\nMetabolic syndrome, manifesting as obesity, hypertension, \r\nhyperlipidaemia and increased insulin resistance, is a well\u0002known adverse effect of atypical antipsychotics; a meta-analy\u0002sis suggests 32% of patients taking atypical antipsychotics will \r\n■ PRESCRIBING IN PRACTICE l Atypical antipsychotics\r\n20 ❚ Prescriber November/December 2021 wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\r\ndevelop it.13 This independently increases the risk of cardiovas\u0002cular disease and mortality, which is already significantly \r\nincreased two- to three-fold in patients with SEMI,14 and thus it \r\nis imperative to review and consider if drug switching, reduction \r\nor withdrawal are possible or necessary at regular intervals. As \r\na result, SEMI patients, who are often diagnosed and treated \r\nfrom a young age, rapidly acquire co-morbidities requiring poly\u0002pharmacy with other medications to control effects – a typical \r\ncase study is given in Box 1. \r\nIn addition to their direct cardiovascular and metabolic \r\neffects, atypical antipsychotics can also adversely affect risk of \r\nsudden cardiac death. This primarily manifests as QTc prolon\u0002gation on ECG, as a result of cumulative use of medications \r\nthat can influence this parameter (eg concomitant prescription \r\nof citalopram). Many patients with polypharmacy have QTc pro\u0002longation but many are not fully monitored for this risk factor.14\r\nNeurological effects from atypical antipsychotics are also \r\nnot uncommon. While atypical antipsychotics do not commonly \r\ninduce Parkinsonian symptoms compared with first-generation \r\nantipsychotics such as haloperidol, many increase prolactin, \r\nmainly through their dopaminergic effect, which can affect sex\u0002ual function.

This is another \r\nreason why a more integrated approach to management of \r\npatients on antipsychotics is warranted. \r\nWhat does a good primary care antipsychotic \r\nmedication review look like? \r\nPrimary care is often now the mainstay of monitoring of many \r\npatients taking antipsychotics, and a comprehensive medica\u0002tion review should be undertaken annually. This involves both \r\nassessment and monitoring of physical risk factors, as well as \r\na review and patient-centred discussion of the risk-benefit ratio \r\nof the medication taken in the longer term. \r\nFigure 1 provides a simple flowchart and consideration of \r\nsome of the common opportunities primary care can have to \r\ninfluence positively the holistic life experience of the patient. \r\nOne suggested approach has been that recognition of signifi\u0002cant weight gain of greater than 10% from discharge (or any BMI \r\n>35), even in those ‘stable’ on antipsychotics, should prompt \r\nthe GP to refer back to secondary care to discuss a dose reduc\u0002tion or a switch to an alternative atypical antipsychotic with a \r\nlower metabolic risk profile (eg switching from olanzapine to \r\naripiprazole).18 A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should also \r\nprompt referral for review, as should any evidence of QTc inter\u0002val prolongation or hyperprolactinaemia. In those re-referral \r\nletters, it is helpful if primary care clinicians highlight the phys\u0002ical risks and request specifically that a review of the atypical \r\nantipsychotic by a psychiatrist is warranted, rather than a review \r\nby another non-prescribing member of the mental health team. \r\nClosing the gap between primary and secondary care\r\nMore patients than ever taking atypical antipsychotics (31%) \r\nare now managed solely by primary care,4 but many GPs are \r\nreluctant to consider adjustment to atypical antipsychotics in \r\nstable patients. This is understandable, given that 45% of \r\nyoung patients with a first episode of psychosis can relapse \r\nfollowing discontiuation.19 However, this also implies many do \r\nnot relapse, but the problem is trying to predict who is most at \r\nrisk: research to guide which patients are at lowest relapse risk \r\nis urgently needed. \r\nIt is understandable that secondary care focuses on those \r\npatients who are unwell, but there is a wider public health con\u0002cern for the long-term risk of these medications and their \r\nimpact on life expectancy and morbidity. A collaborative \r\napproach is needed to aid risk/benefit assessment and agree \r\nan action in partnership with the patient. The question is: how \r\ndo we, as both primary care and secondary care practitioners, \r\nundertake this efficiently? There are several solutions to dis\u0002cuss, and all will require significant investment. \r\n1. The ‘low-tech’ solution: periodic re-referral\r\nPatients who are discharged to primary care on atypical anti\u0002psychotics should, at regular intervals of, say, every five years, \r\nbe offered review by a consultant psychiatrist, and a discussion \r\nof the risk-benefit to continue or trial reduction/cessation of \r\nmedication should be documented. The downside of this \r\napproach is, obviously, the use of scarce consultant psychiatrist \r\nresources to oversee review of ‘stable’ patients, and the obvi\u0002ous reluctance many may feel to interfere with the consequent \r\nrisk of psychotic relapse – it is understandable many clinicians \r\nwill follow the proverb ‘let sleeping dogs lie’. Nevertheless, this \r\napproach gives the patient autonomy and support in decision \r\nmaking from those best able to do it. \r\n2. The ‘medium-tech’ solution: a new role for GPs with \r\nextended roles in mental health\r\nCommissioning bodies should look to employ skilled GPs who \r\ncould, on behalf of a particular CCG or local health board, \r\nundertake structured reviews of patients ‘stable’ for five years \r\non atypical antipsychotics, and make possible reductions in \r\natypical antipsychotic use in a carefully monitored way in care\u0002fully selected patients. The aim should be improved quality of \r\nlife, and success should never be measured by dose reduction \r\nor cessation. This will reduce pressure on secondary care ser\u0002vices and is likely to lead to a more holistic overview of patient \r\nJames is a 35-year-old man with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, \r\nwhich began when he was 19 years old and at university. The condition \r\nwas initially managed with once-daily olanzapine (10mg) and sertraline \r\n(100mg) by his mental health team at university. He then moved house \r\nseveral times, resulting in dislocated continuity of care, before returning \r\nback home aged 22 years, where his GP has managed his medication, \r\nsince he had been discharged from secondary care as ‘stable’ and \r\nwas not attending review appointments (due to invites going to an old \r\nrental address). His only management is an infrequent review of blood \r\ntests and blood pressure (he often misses GP review appointments). \r\nIn the past decade, he has gained 22kg, and now has a BMI of 37 and \r\nhas developed hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. To \r\nmanage these co-morbidities, he is currently prescribed metformin, \r\nperindopril and atorvastatin: the latter cause him muscle aching \r\nand he has erectile dysfunction, which has caused poor medication \r\ncompliance. No monitoring of serum prolactin has been undertaken. A \r\nlocum GP notes he has not had any ECG monitoring in seven years and \r\nfinds his QTc is prolonged at 490ms. He is referred back to secondary \r\ncare for input, but due to pressures on their services and because he \r\nis ‘stable’ from a psychosis point of view, they only suggest a reduction \r\nin sertraline dose to 50mg daily to address the QTc prolongation, \r\nand discharge him back to primary care, suggesting an annual ECG is \r\nundertaken (for which the GP is not funded) and to refer him back if \r\nQTc remains prolonged. \r\nBox 1. A case study of polypharmacy associated with antipsychotic use and \r\n‘disintegrated’ care\r\n■ PRESCRIBING IN PRACTICE l Atypical antipsychotics\r\n22 ❚ Prescriber November/December 2021 wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\r\ncare in terms of their long term physical and mental health. \r\nThe GP with an extended role (GPwER), with a dedicated \r\ncommunity psychiatric nurse to provide regular contact, would \r\noversee the controlled reduction in medication in carefully \r\nselected and consenting patients who are able to maintain \r\nregular contact with both primary and secondary care to monitor \r\nfor any sign of relapse. Of course, there are extreme shortages \r\nof GPs in primary care, and many have limited experience in \r\npsychiatry (a recent survey showed 46% of GPs had no psychi\u0002atric training during the hospital component of vocational train\u0002ing, and while this has improved, most now have only four \r\nmonths’ experience, which is insufficient).20 Funding for training \r\nof GPwER, to include a Diploma in Clinical Psychiatry or Mental \r\nHealth, would be one solution and likely improve the care of \r\npatients presenting with mental health problems in primary \r\ncare, and there is urgent need for accreditation routes to be \r\njointly developed by professional bodies, such as the Royal \r\nCollege of General Practitioners and Royal College of \r\nPsychiatrists.21\r\n3. The ‘high-tech’ solution: use of AI systems and an \r\nintegrated care approach to reduce antipsychotic-associated \r\npolypharmacy harm \r\nBoth of the solutions (1) and (2) are constrained by the current \r\norganisational split in primary and secondary care services. An \r\nintegrated care model to manage those patients at most risk \r\nwould overcome some of this, but the problems remain: too few \r\ntrained staff are available to undertake the specialist work; \r\nidentifying who is least at risk of relapse and would benefit from \r\nintensive controlled reduction is difficult; and the relative cost \r\nof doing so is high. \r\nUsing an artificial intelligence (AI) machine-learning \r\napproach to interrogate practice prescribing systems and iden\u0002tify those patients at risk of atypical antipsychotic-associated \r\nmorbidity and relapse is likely to be the most cost-effective \r\nsolution. This will reduce the person-hours involved in reviewing \r\n‘SEMI registers’, allow focus on those patients who are likely to \r\noffer the greatest returns in terms of staff intervention, and \r\nallow an integrated team to make the most effective interven\u0002tions to optimise antipsychotic prescribing while equally mini\u0002mising risk of relapse.22\r\nThis approach will require research to develop multivariate \r\nregression models to allow AI to interrogate and identify the \r\nmost vulnerable patients from primary care computer systems, \r\nbased on their physical and mental health characteristics and \r\nco-morbidities, but also the subset of those patients who, while \r\n‘stable’ but at high risk of adverse effects of long-term atypical \r\nantipsychotic use, are least likely to be at risk of relapse if dose \r\nreduction or withdrawal is considered. This should be an urgent \r\nfocus for research within the UK, involving the input of psychia\u0002try, public health, computational mathematicians, information \r\ntechnologists and primary care researchers to develop these \r\ntools. Implementation will not be immediate but could be an \r\neventual addition to the solutions offered in scenarios (1) and \r\n(2) to reduce appointment burden and improve the effective\u0002ness of intervention. \r\nConclusion\r\nAtypical antipsychotics are effective therapeutics for the man\u0002agement of a range of psychotic disorders in patients with \r\nSEMI, but they are not without considerable risks when used \r\nlong term.

They were largely \r\nfavoured for their perceived lower profile of extrapyramidal \r\nsymptoms commonly seen with first-generation antipsychotics \r\nsuch as haloperidol, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine.1\r\nHowever, atypical antipsychotics have significant adverse \r\neffects of their own, including worsening risk of type 2 diabetes, \r\nobesity, hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease.2,3\r\nFurthermore, while antipsychotics were originally confined \r\nmainly as therapeutics for SEMI, there is broadening licence \r\nand off-licence use of atypical antipsychotics in patients with \r\nnon-schizophreniform illness, including as a treatment for \r\nresistant depression, emotionally unstable personality disorder \r\nand bipolar disorder.4\r\nWhile atypical antipsychotics are largely effective medica\u0002tions for reducing psychotic symptoms, due to pressures on \r\nsecondary care mental health services, many patients on atyp\u0002ical antipsychotics who are deemed ‘stable’ are transferred \r\nback to management solely within primary care. General prac\u0002tice teams have tended to focus mainly on the physical risk \r\nfactor management of atypical antipsychotic prescriptions, but \r\nfew GPs (an informal survey online suggests less than 10%) \r\nhave the confidence or specialist skills to consider safe reduc\u0002tion or switching of atypical antipsychotics. As such, some \r\npatients may remain on these medications for some years, \r\nperhaps for life, without further psychiatric review.5\r\nManaging patients on atypical \r\nantipsychotics in primary care\r\nALAN WOODALL \r\nAtypical antipsychotics are effective \r\ntreatments for patients with psychotic \r\ndisorders, but prolonged use can \r\nincrease the risk of long-term adverse \r\neffects such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, \r\nhyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular \r\ndisease. This article provides guidance \r\nto help GPs manage patients on these \r\nmedications, and discusses how service \r\nreconfiguration is urgently needed \r\nto improve care for patients who \r\nare currently falling through the gap \r\nbetween primary and secondary care \r\nreview. \r\nSPL\r\nwchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com Prescriber November/December 2021 ❚ 19\r\nAtypical antipsychotics l PRESCRIBING IN PRACTICE ■\r\nThis article discusses the main roles for primary care in the \r\nmanagement of risk factors associated with atypical antipsy\u0002chotics. It also raises the need for a co-ordinated strategy to \r\nensure that there is regular consideration of targeted dose \r\nreduction and withdrawal, and suggests research needed to \r\nachieve this. \r\nRise in use of atypical antipsychotics and the role \r\nof primary care\r\nAntipsychotics are widely prescribed in the general population: \r\nabout 1% of primary care patients are prescribed these medi\u0002cines at any one time.4 Some of the most common atypical \r\nantipsychotics, with their licensed and unlicensed indications, \r\nare shown in Table 1.6 Since their introduction, the use of atyp\u0002ical antipsychotics has broadened, and they are increasingly \r\nbeing favoured by some psychiatry teams as medications \r\nwhich, while effective, also allow discharge of the patient to \r\nprimary care with less blood testing. A typical example of this \r\nis the use of quetiapine monotherapy instead of lithium in the \r\nmanagement of stable bipolar disorder.7\r\nMore atypical antipsychotics are being used in treatment\u0002resistant depression and (off-licence) for mood-stabilisation in \r\npatients with emotionally unstable personality disorder. In older \r\npatients, atypical antipsychotic prescriptions are rising, espe\u0002cially in the management of dementia, despite the concerns \r\nover stroke risk and guidance from NICE that they should be \r\nused only for the shortest possible time and at the lowest pos\u0002sible dose.8 Again, with pressure on mental health services, \r\nmany patients are discharged to equally hard-pressed primary \r\ncare teams to manage and prescribe, which inadvertently trans\u0002fers prescribing risk to the primary care team; nearly one-third \r\nof atypical antipsychotics are now solely prescribed and moni\u0002tored by primary care.9\r\nAdverse effects and risk factors associated with \r\natypical antipsychotics \r\nAtypical antipsychotics are thought to exert their therapeutic \r\neffect mainly via transient ‘on-off’ blockade of the dopaminergic \r\nD2 receptor pathway, but also interact with the anticholinergic, \r\nnoradrenergic, glutaminergic and serotonergic pathways to var\u0002ying degrees, which means the risk of adverse effects is broad \r\nand often difficult to predict.10 Table 2 shows the common \r\nadverse effects of these medications and their relative \r\nrisks.11,12\r\nMetabolic syndrome, manifesting as obesity, hypertension, \r\nhyperlipidaemia and increased insulin resistance, is a well\u0002known adverse effect of atypical antipsychotics; a meta-analy\u0002sis suggests 32% of patients taking atypical antipsychotics will \r\n■ PRESCRIBING IN PRACTICE l Atypical antipsychotics\r\n20 ❚ Prescriber November/December 2021 wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\r\ndevelop it.13 This independently increases the risk of cardiovas\u0002cular disease and mortality, which is already significantly \r\nincreased two- to three-fold in patients with SEMI,14 and thus it \r\nis imperative to review and consider if drug switching, reduction \r\nor withdrawal are possible or necessary at regular intervals. As \r\na result, SEMI patients, who are often diagnosed and treated \r\nfrom a young age, rapidly acquire co-morbidities requiring poly\u0002pharmacy with other medications to control effects – a typical \r\ncase study is given in Box 1. \r\nIn addition to their direct cardiovascular and metabolic \r\neffects, atypical antipsychotics can also adversely affect risk of \r\nsudden cardiac death. This primarily manifests as QTc prolon\u0002gation on ECG, as a result of cumulative use of medications \r\nthat can influence this parameter (eg concomitant prescription \r\nof citalopram). Many patients with polypharmacy have QTc pro\u0002longation but many are not fully monitored for this risk factor.14\r\nNeurological effects from atypical antipsychotics are also \r\nnot uncommon. While atypical antipsychotics do not commonly \r\ninduce Parkinsonian symptoms compared with first-generation \r\nantipsychotics such as haloperidol, many increase prolactin, \r\nmainly through their dopaminergic effect, which can affect sex\u0002ual function.

This is another \r\nreason why a more integrated approach to management of \r\npatients on antipsychotics is warranted. \r\nWhat does a good primary care antipsychotic \r\nmedication review look like? \r\nPrimary care is often now the mainstay of monitoring of many \r\npatients taking antipsychotics, and a comprehensive medica\u0002tion review should be undertaken annually. This involves both \r\nassessment and monitoring of physical risk factors, as well as \r\na review and patient-centred discussion of the risk-benefit ratio \r\nof the medication taken in the longer term. \r\nFigure 1 provides a simple flowchart and consideration of \r\nsome of the common opportunities primary care can have to \r\ninfluence positively the holistic life experience of the patient. \r\nOne suggested approach has been that recognition of signifi\u0002cant weight gain of greater than 10% from discharge (or any BMI \r\n>35), even in those ‘stable’ on antipsychotics, should prompt \r\nthe GP to refer back to secondary care to discuss a dose reduc\u0002tion or a switch to an alternative atypical antipsychotic with a \r\nlower metabolic risk profile (eg switching from olanzapine to \r\naripiprazole).18 A new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should also \r\nprompt referral for review, as should any evidence of QTc inter\u0002val prolongation or hyperprolactinaemia. In those re-referral \r\nletters, it is helpful if primary care clinicians highlight the phys\u0002ical risks and request specifically that a review of the atypical \r\nantipsychotic by a psychiatrist is warranted, rather than a review \r\nby another non-prescribing member of the mental health team. \r\nClosing the gap between primary and secondary care\r\nMore patients than ever taking atypical antipsychotics (31%) \r\nare now managed solely by primary care,4 but many GPs are \r\nreluctant to consider adjustment to atypical antipsychotics in \r\nstable patients. This is understandable, given that 45% of \r\nyoung patients with a first episode of psychosis can relapse \r\nfollowing discontiuation.19 However, this also implies many do \r\nnot relapse, but the problem is trying to predict who is most at \r\nrisk: research to guide which patients are at lowest relapse risk \r\nis urgently needed. \r\nIt is understandable that secondary care focuses on those \r\npatients who are unwell, but there is a wider public health con\u0002cern for the long-term risk of these medications and their \r\nimpact on life expectancy and morbidity. A collaborative \r\napproach is needed to aid risk/benefit assessment and agree \r\nan action in partnership with the patient. The question is: how \r\ndo we, as both primary care and secondary care practitioners, \r\nundertake this efficiently? There are several solutions to dis\u0002cuss, and all will require significant investment. \r\n1. The ‘low-tech’ solution: periodic re-referral\r\nPatients who are discharged to primary care on atypical anti\u0002psychotics should, at regular intervals of, say, every five years, \r\nbe offered review by a consultant psychiatrist, and a discussion \r\nof the risk-benefit to continue or trial reduction/cessation of \r\nmedication should be documented. The downside of this \r\napproach is, obviously, the use of scarce consultant psychiatrist \r\nresources to oversee review of ‘stable’ patients, and the obvi\u0002ous reluctance many may feel to interfere with the consequent \r\nrisk of psychotic relapse – it is understandable many clinicians \r\nwill follow the proverb ‘let sleeping dogs lie’. Nevertheless, this \r\napproach gives the patient autonomy and support in decision \r\nmaking from those best able to do it. \r\n2. The ‘medium-tech’ solution: a new role for GPs with \r\nextended roles in mental health\r\nCommissioning bodies should look to employ skilled GPs who \r\ncould, on behalf of a particular CCG or local health board, \r\nundertake structured reviews of patients ‘stable’ for five years \r\non atypical antipsychotics, and make possible reductions in \r\natypical antipsychotic use in a carefully monitored way in care\u0002fully selected patients. The aim should be improved quality of \r\nlife, and success should never be measured by dose reduction \r\nor cessation. This will reduce pressure on secondary care ser\u0002vices and is likely to lead to a more holistic overview of patient \r\nJames is a 35-year-old man with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, \r\nwhich began when he was 19 years old and at university. The condition \r\nwas initially managed with once-daily olanzapine (10mg) and sertraline \r\n(100mg) by his mental health team at university. He then moved house \r\nseveral times, resulting in dislocated continuity of care, before returning \r\nback home aged 22 years, where his GP has managed his medication, \r\nsince he had been discharged from secondary care as ‘stable’ and \r\nwas not attending review appointments (due to invites going to an old \r\nrental address). His only management is an infrequent review of blood \r\ntests and blood pressure (he often misses GP review appointments). \r\nIn the past decade, he has gained 22kg, and now has a BMI of 37 and \r\nhas developed hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. To \r\nmanage these co-morbidities, he is currently prescribed metformin, \r\nperindopril and atorvastatin: the latter cause him muscle aching \r\nand he has erectile dysfunction, which has caused poor medication \r\ncompliance. No monitoring of serum prolactin has been undertaken. A \r\nlocum GP notes he has not had any ECG monitoring in seven years and \r\nfinds his QTc is prolonged at 490ms. He is referred back to secondary \r\ncare for input, but due to pressures on their services and because he \r\nis ‘stable’ from a psychosis point of view, they only suggest a reduction \r\nin sertraline dose to 50mg daily to address the QTc prolongation, \r\nand discharge him back to primary care, suggesting an annual ECG is \r\nundertaken (for which the GP is not funded) and to refer him back if \r\nQTc remains prolonged. \r\nBox 1. A case study of polypharmacy associated with antipsychotic use and \r\n‘disintegrated’ care\r\n■ PRESCRIBING IN PRACTICE l Atypical antipsychotics\r\n22 ❚ Prescriber November/December 2021 wchh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\r\ncare in terms of their long term physical and mental health. \r\nThe GP with an extended role (GPwER), with a dedicated \r\ncommunity psychiatric nurse to provide regular contact, would \r\noversee the controlled reduction in medication in carefully \r\nselected and consenting patients who are able to maintain \r\nregular contact with both primary and secondary care to monitor \r\nfor any sign of relapse. Of course, there are extreme shortages \r\nof GPs in primary care, and many have limited experience in \r\npsychiatry (a recent survey showed 46% of GPs had no psychi\u0002atric training during the hospital component of vocational train\u0002ing, and while this has improved, most now have only four \r\nmonths’ experience, which is insufficient).20 Funding for training \r\nof GPwER, to include a Diploma in Clinical Psychiatry or Mental \r\nHealth, would be one solution and likely improve the care of \r\npatients presenting with mental health problems in primary \r\ncare, and there is urgent need for accreditation routes to be \r\njointly developed by professional bodies, such as the Royal \r\nCollege of General Practitioners and Royal College of \r\nPsychiatrists.21\r\n3. The ‘high-tech’ solution: use of AI systems and an \r\nintegrated care approach to reduce antipsychotic-associated \r\npolypharmacy harm \r\nBoth of the solutions (1) and (2) are constrained by the current \r\norganisational split in primary and secondary care services. An \r\nintegrated care model to manage those patients at most risk \r\nwould overcome some of this, but the problems remain: too few \r\ntrained staff are available to undertake the specialist work; \r\nidentifying who is least at risk of relapse and would benefit from \r\nintensive controlled reduction is difficult; and the relative cost \r\nof doing so is high. \r\nUsing an artificial intelligence (AI) machine-learning \r\napproach to interrogate practice prescribing systems and iden\u0002tify those patients at risk of atypical antipsychotic-associated \r\nmorbidity and relapse is likely to be the most cost-effective \r\nsolution. This will reduce the person-hours involved in reviewing \r\n‘SEMI registers’, allow focus on those patients who are likely to \r\noffer the greatest returns in terms of staff intervention, and \r\nallow an integrated team to make the most effective interven\u0002tions to optimise antipsychotic prescribing while equally mini\u0002mising risk of relapse.22\r\nThis approach will require research to develop multivariate \r\nregression models to allow AI to interrogate and identify the \r\nmost vulnerable patients from primary care computer systems, \r\nbased on their physical and mental health characteristics and \r\nco-morbidities, but also the subset of those patients who, while \r\n‘stable’ but at high risk of adverse effects of long-term atypical \r\nantipsychotic use, are least likely to be at risk of relapse if dose \r\nreduction or withdrawal is considered. This should be an urgent \r\nfocus for research within the UK, involving the input of psychia\u0002try, public health, computational mathematicians, information \r\ntechnologists and primary care researchers to develop these \r\ntools. Implementation will not be immediate but could be an \r\neventual addition to the solutions offered in scenarios (1) and \r\n(2) to reduce appointment burden and improve the effective\u0002ness of intervention. \r\nConclusion\r\nAtypical antipsychotics are effective therapeutics for the man\u0002agement of a range of psychotic disorders in patients with \r\nSEMI, but they are not without considerable risks when used \r\nlong term.

In accordance with the MLM service duplicate management process, this case is based on that first E2B transmission. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a healthcare professional from The United Kingdom and concerns a male patient (age: unknown) who experienced a serious adverse drug reaction of Erectile dysfunction and a non-serious adverse drug reaction of poor medication compliance associated with atorvastatin, metformin and perindopril and a non-serious adverse drug reaction of Muscle aching with atorvastatin. The patient was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which began when he was 19 years old and at university. The condition was initially managed with once-daily olanzapine (10mg) and sertraline(100mg) by his mental health team at university. He then moved house several times, resulting in dislocated continuity of care, before returning back home aged 22 years, where his GP has managed his medication since he had been discharged from secondary care as ‘stable’ and was not attending review appointments (due to invites going to an old rental address). His only management is an infrequent review of blood tests and blood pressure (he often misses GP review appointments). In the past decade, he has gained 22kg, and now has a BMI of 37, and has developed hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. To manage these co-morbidities, he is currently prescribed metformin, perindopril, and atorvastatin: \r\n\r\nA case received from United Kingdom for PERINDOPRIL, METFORMIN.",{"entities":[[646,661,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[665,672,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[674,689,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[4956,4968,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[6730,6770,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[7670,7676,"TESTNAME"],[7677,7681,"TESTRESULT"],[9923,9934,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[13322,13333,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[13334,13337,"PATIENTSEX"],[14315,14335,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[20350,20369,"TESTNAME"],[23047,23062,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[25348,25352,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[25353,25360,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[25497,25538,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[25567,25697,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[26070,26084,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[26300,26309,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[26314,26325,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[26369,26382,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[26388,26401,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[26567,26577,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[26579,26583,"DRUGSTRUCTUREDOSAGENUMB"],[26589,26599,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[26600,26605,"DRUGSTRUCTUREDOSAGENUMB"],[27115,27119,"TESTRESULT"]]}]]}
