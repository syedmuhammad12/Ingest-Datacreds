Their incidence\r\nvaries from 3% to 72%4 and spans a broad spectrum of symptoms, from subtle changes in mood to severe affective\r\nsyndromes and psychosis,5 as well as cognitive failure. The risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients who begin\r\ntreatment with corticosteroids varies with the individual (age, sex, dose, prior psychiatric history, and various biological\r\nmarkers).6 The time it takes for the symptoms to resolve after interrupting treatment is variable as well.5\r\nWe present the case of a patient with COVID-19 who was admitted to the hospital for bilateral pneumonia, at which\r\ntime he was administered dexamethasone. After discharge, he attempted suicide, which led to admission in the mental\r\nhealth hospitalization unit.\r\nCASE REPORT\r\nThe patient was a married 38-year-old employed father of an 8-month-old son. He weighed 253 lb (115 kg) and had no\r\npersonal or family history of interest or toxic habits.\r\nHe was diagnosed with COVID-19, which started with a fever and cough, following a positive PCR (polymerase chain\r\nreaction) test result. At the beginning of his illness, he was under outpatient follow-up. On day 5 from the onset of\r\nsymptoms, he presented to the emergency department (ED) with oxygen saturation of 91%–92% and was admitted to\r\nthe hospital for observation. He was subsequently admitted to the COVID unit 2 days later. He was diagnosed with\r\nsevere bilateral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was\r\ntreated with dexamethasone 6 mg 4 mg/mL every 24 hours by slow IV (intravenous), budesonide 160 mcg plus\r\nformoterol 4.5 mcg per inhaler every 12 hours, enoxaparin 80 mg once every 24 hours by subcutaneous injection (SC),\r\ndextromethorphan 15 mg every 8 hours, and losartan 25 mg (if blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg).\r\nOn day 8 since the onset of symptoms, partial hypoxemic respiratory failure was identified, and tocilizumab 200-mg/10-\r\nmL injection 800-mg infusion IV was added to his treatment. On day 10 from the onset of symptoms, oxygen saturation\r\nof 97% with oxygen therapy via Ventimask face mask at 50% and 15 L/minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute was\r\nstarted; dexamethasone was increased to 7.2 mg IV every 24 hours; and the second 800-mg bolus IV of tocilizumab\r\nwas administered. On day 11, oxygen saturation of 95% was achieved with the nasal cannula at 4 L/minute with good\r\ntest values (PCR, ferritin, decreasing D-dimer).\r\nOn day 12 since the onset of symptoms and 6 days since the start of treatment with dexamethasone, according to the\r\nclinical history, the patient first began to speak of fear of poor evolution. Both the patient and his wife reported his low\r\nmood, fear of death from the disease, and sleep problems during the days before discharge. On day 14, which was 8\r\ndays since admission to the COVID unit, the patient was discharged and sent home with the following treatment:\r\ndexamethasone 6 mg/24 hours for 4 days and enoxaparin 40 mg SC/24 hours for 14 days.\r\nFrom the time the patient arrived home, his wife said he did not seem “normal” and that he was afraid he would not\r\nrecover and constantly repeated he would not “be the same again.” He was in a very low mood, his spontaneous\r\nconversation decreased, and he lacked motivation, had no appetite, and had insomnia. The patient later admitted that\r\nduring those days, he had intense anxiety, unfounded fears about financial concerns, and ruminative thoughts about\r\nideas of incapacity and desperation.\r\nFour days after his release (day 18 since symptom onset and 12 days since starting treatment with dexamethasone),\r\nthe patient was taken to the hospital ED for a self-inflicted 4-cm parasternal incision. He had attempted suicide, taking\r\nadvantage of his wife’s absence from the home. He was admitted to the emergency observation ward for assessment\r\nand given analgesic treatment with no prescription of corticosteroids (not knowing that the patient had been taking the\r\ntreatment at home).\r\nThe thoracic surgery team evaluated the patient and found no need for intervention related to the wound. Neither the\r\nhemogram nor the general biochemistry provided pathological findings, and a head computed tomography scan was\r\nunremarkable.\r\nA psychiatric evaluation 24 hours after admission described the patient as perplexed, with striking increase in response\r\nlatency and bradyphrenia. He said he felt sad and worried and had insomnia. His emotional response did not fit the\r\nsituation. Therefore, admission to the psychiatric unit was scheduled.\r\nThe patient was reevaluated in the psychiatry unit 48 hours after withdrawal of dexamethasone. He showed remarkable\r\nrecovery from the psychopathological state described at admission. He was aware, oriented, and cooperative in the\r\ninterview; his discourse was adequate and coherent; and reactivity and affective resonance were sufficient. The patient\r\nsaid his mood had improved, and there were no psychotic symptoms. He had an appropriate critical view of the suicide\r\nattempt, for which he was very sorry and explained what had happened due to his low mood and anxiety.\r\nHe agreed to remain hospitalized for a follow-up assessment. According to the infectious medicine team, treatment\r\nwith dexamethasone was restarted at 4 mg for progressive reduction, as the patient had been doing at home (4 mg\r\nadministered the first day of admission to the psychiatry unit and another 4 mg administered on the second day after\r\nadmission).\r\nOn the following day, the patient’s symptoms worsened again. He seemed semiperplexed, with bradypsychia,\r\nincreased response latency, and little spontaneous conversation, and he perceived his cognitive impairment (“The\r\nideas don’t come to me, I’m blocked”). He complained again of lack of energy and low mood.\r\nAs it was suspected that corticosteroids could induce neuropsychiatric symptoms, treatment was suspended. Twentyfour\r\nhours after the last dose of dexamethasone, the patient had improved remarkably, with complete remission of\r\nsymptoms at 72 hours. Five months after release from the hospital, the patient was stable and asymptomatic. Figure\r\n1 provides a timeline of the patient’s course.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWe present what is, to our knowledge, the first report of a failed suicide attempt induced by corticosteroids in the context\r\nof SARS-CoV-2 infection. Suicide is an important public health problem, with almost 700,000 deaths per year.7 The\r\nuse of corticosteroids is related to a dose-dependent increase in risk of suicide (7 times higher in patients with cancer\r\nand twice as high in those treated for other diseases).8 The mechanism that produces secondary lesions in the central\r\nnervous system is not yet clear, although they seem to be related to neurotoxicity of the glutamate and high arterial\r\npressure.9 Corticosteroids increase harm to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus even after brief exposure to those\r\nmolecules. The corticosteroids, through their regulatory function of the raphe-hippocampal serotonin system, can alter\r\nneurotransmission and thereby generate affective symptoms.10\r\nBoth neuroinflammatory mechanisms and neurotropism from SARS-CoV-2 infection, hypoxia, cerebrovascular events,\r\nand the effect of the steroid treatment itself have been proposed as possible biological mediators of neuropsychiatric\r\nalterations in COVID-19.11 Psychosocial factors may also affect the psychiatric consequences of COVID-19. Thus, for\r\nexample, the quarantine implicit after infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been related to negative psychological effects\r\nincluding posttraumatic stress symptoms, confusion, anger,12 anxiety related to fear of spreading the disease to family,\r\nand anxiety related to fear of death.11\r\nFor a drug to be considered responsible for an adverse reaction, it must generally meet the following criteria. First, the\r\ndrug must be able to initiate the symptom within a specified period. Second, removal of the drug must reduce the\r\nsymptom. Third, there must not be any other confounding variable that could be causing the symptom or its\r\nimprovement. Reinstitution of the drug should cause reappearance of the symptom.13\r\nThese 3 criteria were met in our case. The evident chronology found between the appearance and resolution of\r\nneuropsychiatric symptoms and the start and withdrawal of the corticosteroids leads to the conclusion of causality of\r\ncorticosteroids in neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidal behavior. Any possible confounding factors derived from\r\ninfection by SARS-CoV-2 and psychosocial stress associated with the pandemic were determinants not considerably\r\nmodified after resolution of the affective symptoms.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe effects on mental health of the COVID-19 pandemic, infection by SARS-CoV-2, and treatment with corticosteroids\r\nare well known, although the latter is occasionally underestimated. Their confluence may cause a “perfect storm”\r\nsituation, such as observed in our case. As the risk of neuropsychiatric alterations and increase in risk of suicide with\r\ndexamethasone treatment are known, evaluation of patients with COVID-19 should include psychopathologic\r\nassessment and the risk of suicide in all cases.
