The incidence of DILI is very low, with a value between 1 and 19 per 100,000 patient years. All\nantidepressants may induce DILI even at low therapeutic doses. In this report, we present a case of ALI after venlafaxine\nadministration.\nPatient concerns: A 27-year-old Chinese Han woman was admitted for depression. Several serum liver function indices in this\npatient were abnormal after antidepressant treatment. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) causality\nassessment score was 8, and the R value was 31.18.\nDiagnoses: The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular ALI, which was derived from venlafaxine-related adverse events.\nInterventions: First, all medications were stopped to block the progression of DILI. Then, a hepatoprotective strategy and proper\npsychological treatment were performed to recover the impaired hepatic function.\nOutcomes: Liver function was fully recovered as indicated by liver function indices and ultrasound imaging.\nLessons: The possibility of DILI should not be overlooked during the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs. In response, regular liver\n\nfunction monitoring should be performed in a timely manner to avoid missing diagnoses and delayed treatment. Furthermore, the\nnecessary medical treatment needs to be conducted after the occurrence of ALI.\nAbbreviations: ADRs = adverse drug reactions, ALI = acute liver injury, DILI = drug-induced liver injure, VEN = venlafaxine.\nKeywords: acute liver injury, drug-induced liver injure, causality assessment, venlafaxine\n\ncommon ADRs[2,3] are mild, including nausea, vomiting,\ndizziness, diarrhea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, constipation,\nsomnolence, and so on, all of which might be caused by serotonin\ntoxicity or vulnerability to drug-drug interactions.[4] Notably,\nVEN-induced acute liver injury (ALI) has been less reported since\nits approval in 1993.[5–7] It has been conﬁrmed that VEN can\nresult in transient asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and has been linked to rare instances of clinically\napparent ALI.[8] However, the mechanism by which VEN causes\nALI is unknown. In this case report, we describe 1 patient with\ndepression who was diagnosed with ALI after the administration\nof VEN.\n\n1. Introduction\nAs a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine (VEN) has been proven to be well tolerated with a rate of\nadverse drug reactions (ADRs) of less than 1/1000.[1] The most\nEditor: Maya Saranathan.\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this\ncase report and accompanying images.\nThis work was supported by Fund for development of Science and Technology\nof Nanjing Medical University (NMUB2020295).\nThe authors have no conﬂicts of interest to disclose.\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are\navailable from the corresponding author on reasonable request\na\nDepartment of Clinical Psychology, The Afﬁliated Wuxi Mental Health Center\nwith Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214151, China, b Department of\nPharmacy, The Afﬁliated Wuxi Mental Health Center with Nanjing Medical\nUniversity, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214151, China.\n\n2. Case presentation\nA 27-year-old Chinese Han woman was diagnosed with\ndepression. She had no chronic or metabolic liver disease, blood\ntransfusion, or history of alcohol consumption. The patient was\nadmitted to our Department of Clinical Psychology on March 9,\n2021, and low-dose VEN 50 mg (oral, qd) was started to give to\nher. Meanwhile, liver function was normal according to the test\nresults (Table 1). The dosage of VEN was gradually increased to\n225 mg/d on March 19 because of severe depression. The patient\nshowed good tolerance without any symptoms. Additionally,\nshe also received lorazepam 1 mg (oral, qn) and zolpidem tartrate\n10 mg (oral, qn) for treating anxiety symptoms and dyssomnia\nduring this period. After administering these treatments,\ndepressive symptoms were well controlled.\n\n∗\n\nCorrespondence: Kun Yao, Department of Clinical Psychology, The Afﬁliated\nWuxi Mental Health Center with Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu\n214151, China (e-mail: yaokun2021@njmu.edu.cn).\n\nCopyright © 2021 the Author(s).

It has been reported that the dosage\nof VEN-related liver function abnormalities is in the range of 25\nto 300 mg/d with a median dose of 75 mg/d, and the upper limit of\nnormal for concentration of VEN in the patients’ plasma is 400\nng/mL.[9] It is critical to note that this upper value may be\nexceeded in patients who receive only the conventional dosage.\nThis individual difference increases the risk of dose-related\nadverse events. In view of these facts, we ﬁrstly performed the\nplasma drug concentration measurements and the result was only\n93.9 ng/mL, which was even slightly lower than the recommended therapeutic concentration of Arbeitsgemeinschaft für\nNeuropsychopharmakologie und Pharmakopsychiatrie (100–\n400 ng/mL). Second, we attempted to determine the metabolic\nfeatures of VEN in this patient. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in\nthe liver is the predominant metabolic enzyme responsible for\nconverting 90 percent of VEN to O-desmethylvenlafaxine\n(desvenlafaxine).[10] Additionally, CYP2C19 mediates the\nremaining 10% of this demethylation. Indeed, extensive CYP2D6\nand CYP2C19 metabolizers always increase the clearance of\nVEN and maintain a low plasma concentration. To our surprise,\nresults of genetic polymorphism testing showed that CYP2D6\nwas a normal metabolizer with rs1065852 CT, rs16947 CT, and\nrs5030865 GG, while CYP2C19 was an extensive metabolizer\nwith rs4244285 GG, rs4986893 GG, and rs12248560 CC,\nwhich is in accordance with the low exposure of VEN. Third, the\nvulnerability of VEN to drug-drug interactions can also cause\nADRs. In this case, the fast metabolic characteristics of VEN lead\nto a high abundance of cytochrome isoenzymes (mainly CYP2D6\nand CYP2C19) as well as rapidly accumulated O-desmethyl-\n\nBefore leaving the hospital, the liver function as well as her\nblood routine were reviewed on April 14, 2021. The results of\nroutine blood tests were normal, while the symptoms of ALI\n(Table 1) were abnormal elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase to 767 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase to 1777 IU/L,\nalkaline phosphatase to 171 IU/L, g-glutamyltransferase to\n147 IU/L, and 5’-nucleotidease to 37 U/L. Nevertheless, neither\ndilatation of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts nor\nhepatomegaly or splenomegaly were detected by ultrasound of\nthe liver (Fig. 1). These results indicate that ALI was still in its\nearly stages. The results of Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment\nMethod (RUCAM) assessment (score: 8) illustrated that this\nALI (hepatocellular, R = 31.18) was derived from VEN-related\nadverse events.\nBased on these considerations, stopping all medications was\nadopted to block the progression of ALI. g of glutathione 1.08 g\nof magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate 150 mg (intravenous, qd) and\nsilibinin meglumine 100 mg (oral, tid) were administered to the\npatient. Several indices of liver function were recovered based on\nthe results from April 19, 2021 (Table 1). Therefore, the current\nhepatoprotective strategy, as well as proper psychological\ntreatment, were held for this patient. The liver function fully\nrecovered on April 29, 2021 (Table 1), and she was discharged\nfrom the hospital the next day.\n\n3. Discussion\nALI is a rare manifestation of VEN-induced ADRs. Despite the\nunknown mechanism, we attempted to reveal the pathogeny of\n\nFigure 1. The ultrasound of the liver on March 11, 2021 (A) and April 14, 2021 (B).

It can\ninhibit the increase in serum transaminase, reduce the degeneration, necrosis, and inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration of liver cells, and\nhence repair the liver tissue and recover its activity.[12–15] In\naddition, VEN was shown to induce ROS formation to enhance\nthe membrane permeability of mitochondria and lysosomes,\ntriggering apoptosis or necrosis.[16] Thus, ROS scavenger agents\nhave been identiﬁed as promising therapeutic strategies against\ndrug/xenobitic-induced liver injuries.[17]\n\n4. Conclusion\nDuring the administration of VEN or other antidepressants, liver\nfunction monitoring is crucial, and immediate drug withdrawal\nas well as necessary medical treatment should be taken in cases of\nALI to obtain satisfactory post-treatment results. Furthermore,\nmore samples and further explorations are still needed to better\nunderstand the etiology, early diagnosis, and treatment of VENinduced ALI. We hope that our report will provide an effective\nreference for future research on this DILI.\n\nAuthor contributions\nConceptualization: Lin Fang, Kun Yao.\nFunding acquisition: Kun Yao.\nWriting – original draft: Lin Fang, Shushan Wang.\nWriting – review & editing: Leiming Cao, Kun Yao.\n\nReferences\n[1] Fagiolini A, Albert U, Ferrando L, et al.
