The palliative approach in the treatment of these refractory symptoms is\neffective and widely applicable in different settings. We report the case of a patient with refractory dyspnea\nadmitted to a specialized palliative care unit with a very poor prognosis. The application of different tools of the\npalliative approach proved to be effective: a detailed advanced care planning and open communication, the respect\nfor the patient’s wishes and optimal use of his resources—the salutogenesis— an adaptation of the rhythm of care to\nthat of the patient. The patient was then discharged for rehabilitation, and finally returned home.\nKeywords: advanced care planning; post-COVID; refractory dyspnea; salutogenesis; slow medicine\n\nIntroduction\n\nM\n\nr. M.’s case illustrates the efficiency of slow\nmedicine and watchful communication in treating\nrefractory dyspnea, more specifically in a patient suffering\nfrom post-COVID syndrome with panic attacks and neuropsychological sequelea. Individualization of care has been a\ncrucial aspect of this effective and humanist approach.\nCOVID-19 (disease secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection)\npandemic is an outstanding situation, where prompt reactions are necessary to cope with the impressive number of\npatients to avoid care network saturation. However, this acute\nsetting can be an obstacle to patient care when facing postCOVID sequelea and refractory symptoms, which concern\nquite a large number of patients.1\nOur case proves relevance and effectiveness of a multifaceted approach, with specific tools of palliative medicine\nbut useful to common hospital care—as well as principles\napplicable to many different types of disease and patients.\n\nEven in the eye of a bad prognosis, patient’s wishes and needs\nshould be the focus of care including hope if this is what\nthe patient seeks. Optimal drug management of symptoms,\nprogressive and personalized physiotherapeutic approach,\nthoughtful communication with the patient and his family,\nand open-ended goals of care that are adaptable to the patient’s clinical course and wishes are key elements in the\nsuccessful management of these patients. Each member of\nthe team has a particular role in the patient’s treatment, this\ncase, therefore, illustrates operative interdisciplinarity and\nadaptation of care organization to the patient’s needs.\nWe adopted an attitude of ‘‘Hoping for the best, preparing\nfor the worst,’’2 in an open dialogue with the patient and his\nfamily. This approach revealed to be the most genuine way\nfor the patient himself, the family and the team as a whole.\nWe had to help the family to go beyond choosing one way or\nanother; as they were lost, fearing to give false hope to their\nfather, but suffering and unsure about only accompanying for\ndeath.\n\n1\n\nPalliative Care Unit, University Hospital Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.\nPhysiotherapy Team, Palliative Care Unit, University of Geneva, University Hospital Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.\nAccepted February 3, 2022.\n\n2\n\n1606\n\n\f‘‘I AM NOT THE SAME MAN.’’\n\n1607\n\nDownloaded by 144.48.225.235 from www.liebertpub.com at 11/15/22. For personal use only.\n\nCase Description\n\nMr. M, 84 years old, is known for a type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperuricemia. Before the\nrecent situation he was independent for all activities and\ninstrumental activities of daily living, and had no cognitive\nimpairment diagnosed.\nA severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\nsecondary to a SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed on\nNovember 24, 2020 and complicated on admission by\nimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation. The patient was hospitalized and treated with\nnoninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygenotherapy,\nand received three units of platelets concentrate. The ITP\nwas treated with intravenous immunoglobulins, which induced a sudden worsening of respiratory failure, with concomitant hypotension and tachycardia, and were, therefore,\nwithheld. This adverse event was controlled by clemastine\nand high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone.\nThe corticotherapy was switched at day 2 of admission to\noral dexamethasone, with corticosteroid regimen first guided\nby ITP indication, then by SARS-CoV-2–induced ARDS,\nwith positive response with regard to the platelet count. After\n10 days, oral prednisone was introduced and maintained for\nseveral months, as the platelet count systematically decreased\nat each weaning attempt.\nAfter the ARDS, two episodes of bacterial lung superinfection were treated by intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam.\nA urinary sepsis with Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia was\ntreated by intravenous amoxicillin.\nSerial thoracic computed tomodensitometry imaging\nbrought out interstitial fibrosing pneumopathy diagnosed\nas an interstitial pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2\ninfection.\nThe hospitalization was marked by a refractory dyspnea,\nwithout opportunity to taper nasal oxygen therapy, and a lack\nof functional evolution despite regular physiotherapy. After\nmultiple episodes of respiratory distress, the patient developed panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety.\nBecause of the prolonged and untractable dyspnea, he\nexperienced multiple transfers between emergency department, continuous care, acute ‘‘COVID’’ care, and rehabilitation. To find an appropriate settings of care for this kind of\n\nsubacute condition marked with major respiratory distress\nepisodes is problematic. During his stay in the different units,\nhe was followed by the mobile palliative care team.\nAfter two and a half months of hospitalization, a transfer\nto a specialized palliative care unit was suggested to focus\non symptom management, especially dyspnea and anxiety\ncontrol.\nUpon admission to our palliative care unit, Mr. M. was on\n3 L/min oxygen at rest and was hypoxemic at breathing\nambient air. With the slightest physical effort, he experienced\nmajor respiratory distress symptoms, with tachypnea and\nhypoxemia and a dramatic increase in oxygen need. Every\nmove was anticipated by panic attacks, inducing tachypnea\nand worsening the dyspnea.\nTaking into account the length of the hospital stay with\nvirtually no progress in respiratory function and, therefore,\nalso in mobility and autonomy of the patient, as well as his\naccumulation of complications, medical staff had little hope\nfor improvement of the global situation, let alone for discharge\nat home. The family had the same impression, but was afraid to\nshare this with the patient. On the contrary, Mr. M kept his\nhope up and all through the stay he was motivated to participate in physiotherapy and maintained his goal of going home.\nWe adopted an approach of ‘‘hoping for the best, and\npreparing for the worst’’ (Back). During the advance care\nplanning, we discussed several issues with the patient such as\nthe possibility of death in the coming weeks due to respiratory failure and exhaustion, as well as palliative sedation in\ncase of untractable dyspnea. In case a superinfection should\nhappen, we decided with the patient to adopt a curative\napproach with antibiotherapy if needed. Everyone agreed to\nlimit the care level to our unit and not to transfer the patient\nto an acute setting in case of complications.\nIn the point of the patient’s view, ‘‘hoping for the best’’\nwas his main theme. Therefore, according to his goals of\ncare, we set up multiple interventions at different levels to\nhandle this refractory dyspnea and functional lack of progress. They were regularly assessed and updated during our\ninterdisciplinary team meetings (Table 1).\nFurthermore, each team member used a compassionate\nanxiolytic communication, to improve patient confidence.\nA nurse trained in hypnotherapy helped the patient to take\na shower while keeping him in a trance state.

We tried a lorazepam treatment\nto mitigate the anticipatory anxiety, but it was poorly tolerated,\nwith secondary acute delirium. Apart from this acute event, we\nnoticed the onset of moderate cognitive impairment with episodes of persecuted thoughts with delusional speech.\nSo quetiapine was introduced, with adequate tolerance and\nefficiency on these symptoms as on anticipatory anxiety. He\nwas evaluated for dementia outside of these acute episodes,\nand scored 20/30 on the mini-mental state examination. By\nthe time of discharge, his cognitive impairment remained\nstable (memory impairment with moderate anterograde amnesia), but with a complete resolution of panic attacks and\npersecuted thoughts, which were the main obstacles to his\nprogress in physiotherapy.\nOverall, Mr. M.’s cognitive impairment did not prevent\nhim from collaborating with the various caregivers and\nmaking progress in the management of dyspnea, largely\nthanks to his will and his personal and familial resources.\nWe focused not only on patient care but also on the family\nwell-being. Relatives were in distress, not knowing how\nto communicate anymore with their father, not wanting to\ndestroy his hope but feeling they were lying to him if being\ntoo optimistic. They were seen regularly in family meetings\ntogether with the patient, as well at separately with the physician and the psychologist. They played an active and supportive role to Mr. M.\nDiscussion\n\nThe long-term after effects of COVID-19 infection\nrepresent an aftershock for the health care system. Sixty\npercent of COVID-19 survivors suffer from at least one\npost-COVID-19 symptom for >30 days after onset or hospitalization.1 After being hospitalized in intensive care for\nARDS, patients show a high prevalence of reduced functionality, persistent dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety, and depression.3 Long-term cognitive sequels and impaired memory\nare seen in some patients.4\nIn the setting of refractory and neuropsychiatric symptoms, a palliative approach can prove to be very efficient, as\nseen with our patient. Putting the symptom itself in the focus\nof care using a multimodal approach, and avoiding iatrogenesis, may provide more chances of positive outcomes than\nthe standard disease-only oriented approach.\nThe slower pace allowed by the palliative medicine setting is\none of its most important advantages. Using slow medicine for\nproviding care can give the patient time to mobilize his resources at his own rhythm. And thus it avoids the care provider\nimposing his objectives and the way to achieve them.5,6 This\napproach can profoundly empower the patient as an individual,\nand may unite the family and team around him.6,7 What is\nnoteworthy is that Mr. M. was in need for time: for movement\n\nULPIANO TRILLIG ET AL.\n\ninitiation and to apprehend any changes. The slowly increasing\npace of physiotherapy, adapted to Mr. M.’s will and capacity,\nis a great example of how our team applied slow medicine.\nAnother key aspect of this case and the palliative approach\nis the use of different tools of communication. The salutogenesis8,9 is an approach that was widely used. It consists of\nproviding care by focusing on personal, familial, and environmental resources of the patient, thereby strengthening his\nhealth, instead of focusing on the causes of the disease. In the\ncase of Mr. M., all health care providers took advantage of\nhis optimism, his humor, and the meaning provided by his\nfamilial support—strengthening these qualities by adapted\ncommunication—and his desire for self-management was\nrespected by adapting the pace and intensity of therapy.\nPositive reinforcement was systematically used by the\nphysiotherapists and nurses, beginning each care with some\nwords about the progress made the days before. Hypnosis\nwas also used dissociating the patients’ feelings of distress,\nanticipatory panic attacks, and tachypnea, from the actual\ntask he was doing. This approach also had a great impact on\nhis improvement. Space and time were always given to\nMr. M. to express about how he felt and his wishes. Finally\nthe whole team communicated in a consistent way, discussed\nin interdisciplinary meetings, and leaving a homogeneous\nmessage to the patient and his family.\nThis case is a perfect illustration of advanced care planning,10,11 respecting the patient’s autonomy and improving\nthe quality of care in its different aspects. The communication tools allowed the team to strengthen the therapeutic relationship with the patient and his family, and adopt\nan approach of ‘‘hoping for the best and preparing for the\nworst.’’ Explicit acceptance of outcome ignorance allowed\nexploration of different scenarios without censuring any.\nThus a sincere, honest, and open dialogue was set.\n*\nCorrection added on March 23, 2022 after first online\npublication of March 10, 2022: In the opening sentence of\nthe paragraph above beginning with ‘‘This case is a perfect\nillustration...’’ the quotation in the second sentence was\nmisworded.

Part of the mini-mental state examination, where\nthe patient writes a spontaneous sentence: ‘‘I am not the\nsame man, since my accident 3 months ago’’ (in French with\npatient’s permission).\n\n\f‘‘I AM NOT THE SAME MAN.’’\n\nPulmonary recovery secondary to the natural course of the\ndisease itself is likely, even though to an unknown extent.\nNevertheless, our team and the patient noticed a marked\nimprovement when the palliative approach was adopted,\nallowing the patient to cross a milestone with efficient\nphysiotherapy, improving pulmonary and overall recovery.\nAs Mr. M. quoted ‘‘I am not the same man.,’’ (Fig. 1) our\nteam can also say ‘‘we are not the same anymore.’’ May it be\nthe pandemic with the suffering that we experienced or the\nhope that lasts the longest, we all have learned that working\ntogether and going into the same direction is very gratifying\nfor everyone.\n\nDownloaded by 144.48.225.235 from www.liebertpub.com at 11/15/22. For personal use only.\n\nCase Resolution\n\nProgressively, Mr. M. was weaned off the oxygen, and\nmade continuous progress in daily living activities. After his\ndischarge from the palliative care unit, he continued to\nprogress in a rehabilitation unit in the same hospital. He\nreturned back home six months after his initial admission\nwith COVID-19 ARDS, and ITP. At discharge he was breathing ambient air, and had an impressive recovery of all daily\nliving activities. Few weeks later, his family sent a post card\nshowing him gardening in front of his house.\nConclusion\n\nPalliative approach to refractory dyspnea in post-COVID\nsyndrome proved that useful key elements are a patientcentered care in terms of objectives, pace and organization of\ncare, optimal pharmacological management, progressive physiotherapeutic approach, salutogenesis, and appropriate tools\nof communication with the patient and his family, including\nan open and sincere dialogue about the unknown outcome.\nThis approach could be widely applied and adapted to the\nplethora of post-COVID patients with refractory dyspnea,\npanic attacks, PTSD, and neuropsychological sequelae.\nConsent\n\nThe patient gave written consent for publication of this\ncase report.\nFunding Information\n\n1609\n\n2.
