It is deemed a rare phenomenon, although it has been recognized\r\nthat the scattered nature of Cotard's syndrome reports impedes\r\nrigorous systematic comparisons, from which to derive reliable estimates\r\nof incidence or prevalence. It has been described in a wide\r\nrange of age groups and across different diagnosis, with an apparent\r\nslightly higher prevalence in women [3]. Although raising interesting\r\nphilosophical questions and providing a living model to further insights\r\ninto the neurocognitive mechanisms subjacent to the embodied sense\r\nof existence, the intricacies of belief formation and even the limits of\r\nconsciousness, this phenomenon remains largely inexplicable. Before\r\nbeing popularized and renamed as an eponym by Séglas [4], the condition\r\nwas named by Cotard himself as “délire des négations”, involving\r\nseveral characteristics beyond the current simplified equivalence to\r\nthe believe that one's dead. These included a tendency to oppose everything\r\nsaid or offered, denying the existence of other people and the outside\r\nworld, feelings of body displacements and transformations,\r\npassivity phenomena,misidentification of others,mutismand immobility\r\n[1]. Neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropsychological investigations\r\nof Cotard's syndrome have yielded contrasting results.\r\nThis presses the question on how to best manage patients with such\r\npresentation. Although not officially recognized in the two main diagnostic\r\nmanuals, Cotard's syndrome is generally accepted as a severe disorder\r\nwarranting immediate intervention and close monitoring.\r\nLiterature reports range from the assumption of a chronic course, to\r\nspontaneous remission, to treatment according to the underlying diagnosis\r\n– seemingly the best approach while specific etiological considerations\r\nare unclear [3]. As such, a careful evaluation of the affective,\r\npsychotic, and organic aspects of a Cotard syndrome presentation\r\nshould be conducted before a treatment is considered. Many therapeutic\r\ninterventions are reported as potentially efficacious mostlywhere an\r\nunderlying psychotic depression or melancholia is diagnosed.\r\nClinicians have long intuited that heterogeneity in treatment response\r\nis the direct result of etiological heterogeneity. The classification\r\nof depression has long been a contentious issue, but the dominant diagnostic\r\nmodel today is unitarian (the major guide for therapeutic choice\r\nbeing severity). Nevertheless, since Kurt Schneider propounded the\r\nconcepts of melancholic depression and reactive depression [5], this binary\r\nmodel has been used on a clinical basis.\r\nRecently, thiswas investigated in clinical practice by Mizushima and\r\ncolleagues [5], who disclosed that not only this nosographic bifurcation\r\nwas deemed useful in the studied population of practicing psychiatrists,\r\nit also guided therapeutic action: with antidepressants, antipsychotics\r\nand eletroconvulsive therapy being positively endorsed for melancholic\r\ncases and inversely unrecommended for reactive cases, in which anxiolytics\r\nand psychotherapy were the preferred options. Of note, the clinical\r\nvignettes used by the authors were of similar severity, and thus the\r\nclinical attitudes adopted contradicted most prescribing guidelines\r\n(where only the severity indexes guide therapeutic directions). So,\r\noverall, although the current dominant model of major depressive disorder\r\nis unitarian (stating that different presentations lie on the same\r\nspectrum and differ only in severity), psychiatrists have traditionally,\r\nand still contemporaneously, used the binary approach in guiding therapeutic\r\nactions. This issue is not a mere nosologomania (it's been long\r\nacknowledged that psychiatric nosographies are strongly contingent,\r\nwith authors divided between the lumpers and the splitters across discussions),\r\nbut impacts strongly particularly in inbetween presentations,\r\nas the case we will be describing. Adding to the theoretical questions\r\nhere introduced, the clinical casewe report also exposes the therapeutic\r\nstrategies, which had to be adapted as a result to the governmentimposed\r\nrestrictions related to the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic and iatrogenic\r\nintercurrences.\r\nMethods\r\nThe information for this case report was obtained through evaluation\r\nof the patient fromadmission to discharge. Besides,we did a narrative\r\nreview in Pubmed using the keywords: “refractory depression”;\r\n“psychotic depression”and “Cotard syndrome”. Written informed consent\r\nwas obtained from the patient.\r\nCase Report\r\nR. is a 64 years old married woman with psychiatric antecedents of\r\nmultiple episodes of major depressive disorder since she was a young\r\nlady. She had one inpatient psychiatric admission in 2010, with the diagnosis\r\nof major depressive disorder with psychotic features. A total\r\nthyroidectomy had been performed in 2017 as curative treatment of\r\nan early-stage thyroid malignancy, and she was chronically medicated\r\nwith levothyroxine with stable hormonal values.\r\nNo other relevant antecedents were described. She was brought to\r\nthe psychiatric emergency department by her husband, who reported\r\na progressive onset of depressive symptoms for at least six months,\r\nwith anorexia and severeweight loss, social isolation and avoidant conduct,\r\nand depressive mood. On observation, the patient displayed notable\r\npsychomotor retardation, avoidant eye contact, and few\r\nverbalizations interpreted as deliroid thought contents “my mouth\r\nwas shut, my voice was stripped from me (…) I am a monster, I have\r\nno bones or blood, I am dead, this will never end, it is all my fault\r\n(…)”. She was in the inpatient ward for two months.\r\nThe therapeutic strategy involved a switch from previously prescribed\r\nescitalopram 20 mg to venlafaxine 225 mg associated with\r\nmirtazapine 30 mg and from sulpiride 50 mg to olanzapine 10 mg.\r\nAfter two months, she was discharged with apparent total remission\r\n(a deliroid residue with partial insight is described in the week prior\r\nto the discharge, but apparently with no other psychopathological findings\r\non mental status examination). One day after being discharged, R.\r\nwas again brought to the emergency department by the husband, who\r\ndescribed that after a few hours where “shewas again herself”, she verbalized\r\n“I am dead” and became “immobile and refused eating and\r\ndrinking”. On observation, R. was in a state of akinetic mutism, reacting\r\nonly to painful stimuli. She was again admitted to the psychiatric inpatientward\r\nafter medical and neurological evaluation proved to be unremarkable.\r\nAfter escalating the prescribed antidepressants and\r\nantipsychotic towards maximum doses with refractory psychopathology\r\nand progressive worsening of physiological parameters (as the patient\r\nkept refusing eating and drinking), electroconvulsive therapy\r\n(ECT)was discussedwith the senior advisors and considered the appropriate\r\noption. As the referral was being planned, the ECT unit had to\r\ntemporarily close due to the government-imposed restrictions related\r\nto the SARS-CoV2 pandemic and necessary rearrangement of humanresources.\r\nWithout the possibility of ECT, the team initiated a trial\r\nA.P. Gomes, L.C. Gomes, E. Gonçalves et al. Psiquiatría Biológica 29 (2022) 100379\r\n\r\n\r\nwith clomipramine. As dosage was slowly titrated with serial EKG performed,\r\nthe patient presented minimal but visible improvement. On\r\n150 mg of clomipramine, R. presented elevation of hepatic lesion\r\nmarkers (gamma glutamyl-transferase of 450 U/L, alcakaline phosphatase\r\nof 482 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase of 81 U/L and alanine aminotransferase\r\nof 367 U/L) and mild elevation of C-Reactive protein,\r\ninterpreted as iatrogenic (with progressive normalization as clomipramine\r\nwas being stopped). As soon as the ECT unit opened, the patient\r\nstarted the treatment; twelve sessionswere prescribed. After 6 sessions,\r\nthere was an impressive psychopathological improvement, and R. was\r\nmuch less lentified and more communicative, with no spontaneous\r\nmention to deliroid contents. No notable side effects of ECT were observed.\r\nOn evaluation after the 10th session, R. presented with sudden\r\nspace and time disorientation, gross retrograde memory gaps and a perplexed\r\nexpression, verbalizing and behaving as if shewas going towork\r\n(R. was retired for a few years). Coincidentally, the day before she had\r\nbeen on the phone with her husband planning to return home. On the\r\nfollowing days R. got progressively better and was discharged after\r\n3 months in the ward with monthly maintenance ECT planned. On the\r\n1-month post-discharge follow up appointment, R. was in total\r\nremission.\r\nDiscussion\r\nThe presented case raised as much theoretical debate as has clinical\r\nchallenges, particularly in light of the SARS-CoV2 contingencies - which\r\nincluded a temporary unavailability of the ECT unit and the impossibility\r\nof in-person interview with the husband and sister. The major point\r\nof theoretical discussion was focused on the question endogenous v. reactive.\r\nWhenR. was first admitted to our inpatientward, therewere not\r\nmany diagnostic doubts. She presented almost all criteria for major depressive\r\nepisodewith psychotic features. Therewas an indolent onset of\r\ndepressive symptoms with progressive severity, culminating with a\r\nCotard-like syndrome presentation, with no relevant psychosocial\r\nstressors identified. There was an apparently good response to the prescribed\r\ncombination of antidepressants and antipsychotic, achieved\r\nonly with high-end doses. She was discharged in clinical remission.\r\nWhat was baffling was the catastrophic acute worsening that led to\r\nthe second inward admission just a day after discharge.\r\nAgain, no psychosocial stressor was identified (even though on\r\nphone call the patient's sister surreptitiously blamed the husband and\r\nindicated, albeit proofless, the possibility of domestic violence, something\r\nthe patient always denied). Furthermore, the patient's prior presentation\r\nand history had no suggestive hysteria stigmas that could\r\npoint to other lines of diagnosis, including dissociation or conversion.\r\nThe presentation was even severer this time and considered refractory.\r\nIt was decided that the patient should be proposed to ECT, even if a dissociative\r\ncomponent could not be entirely excluded at this point, but in\r\nthe meantime the ECT unit was temporarily shut. To further complicate\r\nthe patient's management, she presented a pattern of cholestatic hepatitis\r\nthat was attributed to iatrogenic effect of clomipramine. Fortunately,\r\nthe ECT unit re-opened shortly after, and indeed the patient\r\nhad an impressive clinical response. The episode described after the\r\n10th session, again, prompted discussion. The inability to recall personal\r\ninformation seemed too extensive to be attributed to the commonly\r\nECT-associated transient memory loss. De novo dissociative episode\r\nafter ECT is described in the literature [6], although not being a frequent\r\ncomplication of the treatment. The preparation of clinical discharge and\r\nthe telephonic conversation with the husband (the content of which is\r\nunknown) in the previous night could have been interpreted as a threat\r\nby the patient, eliciting a dissociative response. Again, the endogenous\r\nv. reactive discussion arose. Indeed, the contingent nature of psychiatric\r\nnosography must be acknowledged. The atheoretical turn of DSM-III\r\nand posterior editions contributed crucially to solve many prior issues\r\nof the psychiatric diagnosis, especially concerning external validity,\r\ninter-rater fidelity and consequent possibility of homogenous groupings\r\nfor naturalistic studies. Nevertheless, as robust overarching integrative\r\netiological theories are yet to emerge, clinicians make use of concepts\r\nimported from diverse theoretical contributions, in a more or less\r\novert pluralistic attitude. The presented case, beyond the management\r\nchallenges, illustrates the complexity of even seemingly clear clinical\r\npresentations, and how they can resist our different conceptualizations.\r\nConclusions\r\nCotard syndrome is a complex phenomenon thatmay appear associated\r\nwith different underlying aetiologies. When presented as a psychotic\r\nfeature of a major depressive episode, it is expected to resolve\r\nas affective symptoms are treated. The division of disorders in reactive\r\nor endogenous is classical and not fostered by current diagnostic manuals.\r\nNevertheless, it is still a useful clinical guide employed in practice.\r\nThe authors presented a case of a major depressive episode with psychotic\r\nfeatures presenting as a Cotard syndrome that defied this pragmatic\r\noriented bifurcation endogenous v. reactive. The complicated\r\nmanagement was discussed – from refractoriness to second line treatment\r\noptions, to iatrogenic hepatitis with clomipramine, to the contingencies\r\nassociatedwith the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The authors reflected\r\non the theoretical dilemmas posed by the case progression, believing it\r\nmay contribute to fostering a humble, pluralistic and diachronically oriented\r\nattitude when diagnostic considerations are concerned.\r\nThis article was presented in the modality of Poster Presentation at\r\nthe 20thWPAWorld Congress of Psychiatry, which took place between\r\n10 and 13/03/2021.\r\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies\r\nin the public, commercial, or notfor-profit sectors.\r\nReferences\r\n1.
