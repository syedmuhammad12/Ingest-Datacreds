It usually acts as an opportunistic pathogen,\r\nmostly in immunocompromised patients, and is aggressive with\r\nhigh mortality and morbidity rates (1, 4, 5). IFD is more\r\ncommon in patients with acute myeloid leukemia than in\r\nthose with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, a\r\nrecent study had shown that despite the recent breathtaking\r\ndevelopment of antifungal drugs, patients of ALL with\r\nprolonged neutropenia were also associated with a higher risk\r\nof acquiring IFD (6, 7).\r\nMucoraceae are classified into filamentous fungi.\r\nLichtheimia ramosa, formerly known as Absidia idahoensis,\r\nbelongs to the order of Mucorales and is currently regarded as\r\nan emerging pathogen (8–11). Mucormycosis caused by\r\nLichtheimia species has increased from 5% to more than 19%\r\nin the last decade, and it is associated with dissemination and\r\nlife-threatening complications (12–14). Cases have been\r\nreported in patients with diabetes, severe burns, chronic\r\ngranulomatous disease, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\r\nThe infections often develop rapidly and can potentially be\r\nangioinvasive, predominantly with pulmonary manifestations\r\n(13, 15). However, the early symptoms are unusual, and\r\ntraditional etiological detection methods are ineffective.\r\nClinically, most Lichtheimia infections were treated empirically\r\nwith no definite diagnosis (16, 17). Early diagnosis and\r\ntreatment can result in a better prognosis (4).\r\nHere, we first report a case of lung mucormycosis in a child\r\nfollowing induction chemotherapy for B-cell ALL. This is the\r\nfirst known published case of a child surviving pulmonary\r\nmucormycosis caused by Lichtheimia ramosa after prompt\r\nantifungal medication and aggressive surgical treatment.\r\nCase description\r\nA 3-year-old girl was admitted to West China Second\r\nUniversity Hospital who presented with fever and a pale\r\nappearance and diagnosed with early precursor B-cell ALL\r\nwith ETV6-RUNX1 fusion after MICM (morphology,\r\nimmunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology)\r\nclassification. No chromosomal abnormality was detected.\r\nBefore chemotherapy, the brain and chest computed\r\ntomography (CT) scan showed a negative result (Figures 1A,\r\nB). The patient was stratified into the low-risk group and\r\nsuccessfully treated with induction therapy using the Chinese\r\nChildren Cancer Group 2020 (CCCG-ALL-2020) protocol. It\r\nconsisted of dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 per day, 4 days),\r\nprednisone (45 mg/m2 per day, 24 days), vincristine,\r\ndaunorubicin, pegaspargase, and intrathecal injection of\r\ncytarabine, methotrexate (MTX), and dexamethasone (triple\r\nIT) in our hospital. The bone marrow response on day 19\r\n(calculated from the start of chemotherapy) was evaluated\r\nusing bone marrow aspiration and minimal residual disease\r\n(MRD). The bone marrow smear suggested complete remission,\r\nand the MRD was negative (<0.01%). ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene\r\nwas negative.\r\nDuring the first course of induction chemotherapy, the\r\npatient experienced significant neutropenia for 21 days. On\r\nday 1, piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium were given\r\nFIGURE 1\r\nBrain and Chest CT before and after surgery.

On day 23, she complained of oral pain.\r\nOn presentation, her neutrophil count was 0.02 × 109/l with\r\nraised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 19.2 mg/l. Due to positive oral\r\nsecretion cultures for Burkholderia polyphagy, the antibiotic\r\ntherapy was switched to Tienam. On day 28, she complained\r\nof a fever (38.3°C), followed by a cough, dyspnea, and swelling of\r\nthe face on day 30. Chemotherapy was discontinued. Results of\r\nthe blood culture, serum galactomannan antigen (GM) test, and\r\n1,3-b-D glucan test (G test) were negative. The patient was\r\npositive for rhinovirus in the throat swab and gram-positive\r\ncoccus in the sputum smear. A blood count indicated that the\r\npatient had severe neutropenia (<0.05 × 109/l). Procalcitonin\r\nand serum CRP levels were 1.73 ng/ml and 176.3 mg/l,\r\nrespectively. Chest CT showed a nodular lesion (3.2 cm ×\r\n2.8 cm) in the post-basal segment of the left lower lobe with\r\nground glass opacification (Figure 1C). The CT scans of the\r\nabdomen, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid test, all showed\r\nnormal results. However, the parents later refused for the patient\r\nto undergo head CT examination due to economic reasons.\r\nGiven the possibility of an opportunistic pathogen infiltrating\r\nthe fungi prophylaxis and causing pulmonary infection, the\r\nantifungal therapy was changed to voriconazole, added with\r\nvancomycin. However, the high fever and dyspnea persisted. On\r\nday 34, the CRP increased to 301.8 mg/l, and following positive\r\nevolution with metagenomic next-generation sequencing\r\n(mNGS) (identified by Hugo Biotech, China, free testing) in\r\nthe genomic DNA of the blood and sputum specimen,\r\nLichtheimia ramosa was detected. Meanwhile, mNGS\r\nidentified gram-positive streptococcus in the sputum specimen\r\nbut no pathogenic prokaryotic microorganisms or viruses in the\r\nblood specimen. mNGS in cerebrospinal fluid specimens was\r\nalso performed to determine intracranial IFD, although the\r\nresults were negative. Because the test results were consistent\r\nwith the clinical manifestations, we adjusted the antifungal\r\ntreatment regimen to amphotericin B (amphotericin B\r\nliposomes were not available) intravenously (the initial dose\r\nwas 0.2 mg/kg and increased up to 1.5 mg/kg gradually within 4\r\ndays); the therapeutic dose was administered intravenously for 9\r\nweeks. The antibiotic therapy was switched to linezolid\r\ncombined with Tienam. Meanwhile, the renal function was\r\nmonitored and found to be normal. She experienced transient\r\nhypokalemia (2.33 mmol/l, normal range 3.5–5.5 mmol/l),\r\nwhich was resolved with oral and intravenous potassium\r\nsupplementation. On day 38, repeated CT showed a larger\r\ninitial nodular lesion and a new lesion in the upper lobe of the\r\nright lung (Figure 1D). On day 44, the patient’s temperature was\r\nback to normal. On day 52, a repeat CT revealed that the initial\r\nnodular lesion had gotten larger (4.7 cm × 24.3 cm) with part\r\nconsolidation and that the initial regional hazy shadow had\r\ndisseminated diffusely in the left lung. New regional shadows\r\nwere seen in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figures 1E, F).\r\nComputer tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted and\r\ndemonstrated no fungal flora in the blood vessels (Figure 1G). A\r\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) met the recommended surgical\r\ntreatment for the patient. Meanwhile, posaconazole was added\r\n(6 mg/kg oral q6h) combined with amphotericin B. The blood\r\nconcentration of posaconazole was in the normal range. On day\r\n66, surgical management involved the lower lobe of the left lung\r\nand pleura (Figure 1H). The yellow and white fungal lesions in\r\nthe basal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung were observed\r\nduring surgery. Irregular fungal balls (3.0 cm) and necrosis\r\nlesions were observed in the pulmonary alveoli. A microscopic\r\nexamination revealed tissue necrosis (Figures 2A, B), fungal\r\ncenobium in the pulmonary alveoli (Figure 2C), and\r\nfilamentous fungi in the removed pulmonary specimen\r\n(Figure 2D). It was positive for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain\r\n(Figure 2E) and Gomori methenamine silver stain (Figure 2F)\r\nbut negative for acid-fast stain. On day 84, the patient started the\r\nsecond induction therapy with cyclophosphamide cytarabine\r\nand mercaptopurine. The chemotherapy was completed\r\nwithout the recurrence of the fungal infection. After every 3\r\nmonths of follow-up, the patient was sequentially treated with\r\nposaconazole and was continuously in complete remission.\r\nThere was no progression of mucormycosis in the chest CT\r\n(Figure 1J) on 6 months after surgery. Brain CT was conducted\r\nafter active persuasion, and it showed a good image (Figure 1I).\r\nThe clinical course and timeline of the treatment course are\r\nsummarized in Figure 3 and Table 1.\r\nDiscussion and review of\r\nthe literature\r\nMucormycosis is an opportunistic invasive fungal infection\r\ncaused by Mucoralean and zygomycetes fungus, like the\r\nLichtheimia species. This fungus is found almost ubiquitously\r\nin soil, farming products, and processed and unprocessed food\r\nproducts (12, 18). Despite being classified as a low-virulence\r\npathogen, the percentage of Mucor infections caused by\r\nLichtheimia species has increased from 5% to more than 19%\r\nin the last decade, according to recent reviews (13, 19).\r\nLichtheimia ramosa is the most common pathogenic\r\nLichtheimia species and a leading cause of mucormycosis (15).\r\nThe clinical disease resembles infections with other mucoralean\r\nfungi. The pulmonary is the most common organ infected by\r\nLichtheimia ramosa. Cutaneous and subcutaneous were also\r\nobserved in some cases (18). Most patients with serious\r\nmucormycosis underlying diseases, such as hematological\r\nmalignancies, are predominantly at risk (1). Classically, the\r\nrisk of mucormycosis has been considered higher in AML and\r\nHSCT than in ALL (20–22). In this study, reports about\r\nLichtheimia ramosa mucormycosis in leukemia published in\r\nliterature were reviewed. Here, we performed a detailed review of\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 03 frontiersin.org\r\nLichtheimia ramosa-induced mucormycosis events in leukemia\r\nbased on available case reports (Table 2). For the cases reviewed,\r\nthere have been rare reports of Lichtheimia ramosa infection in\r\nleukemia (23–25). The three cases were all reported with AML,\r\nwith one case including an adult patient’s skin mucormycosis.\r\nThe other child with AML had pulmonary and cerebral\r\nmucormycosis caused by Lichtheimia ramosa. However, the\r\nepisode was rare in ALL for the patient infected with\r\nLichtheimia ramosa. This is the first reported case of pediatric\r\nALL in our study. Risk factors are indeed a matter of great\r\nconcern to us. A thorough search for risk factors can aid in the\r\nreduction of opportunistic infections and improve patient\r\nFIGURE 3\r\nThe clinical course of the patient. The patient had fever on day 28 and persistent fever for several days. Fever subsided after amphotericin B and\r\nposaconazole treatment. The ANC and CRP data were also obtained. The temperature was gradually increased on day 23 and peaked on day\r\n34. A blood count revealed persistence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia on day 30. On day 66, surgical management was performed. On\r\nday 84, the patient started the second induction therapy.\r\nFIGURE 2\r\nMicroscopic examination of the removed lung. (A-D).

In the case of our patient, it would be reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the infection occurrence was related to\r\nimmunocompromised status induced by hematological\r\nmalignancies; the ETV6-RUNX1 gene is a marker of good\r\nprognosis for ALL. However, clinical studies have shown that\r\nALL patients carrying this gene are more susceptible to severe\r\nopportunistic infections, which may be associated with high\r\nsusceptibility to chemotherapy, resulting in long-term severe\r\ngranulocytosis. For this patient, in addition to the above risk\r\nfactors, living near garbage sites, vegetable markets, and flower\r\nshops as well as poor sanitation may increase the risk of fungal\r\ninfection. At the same time, long-term poor appetite and poor\r\nnutritional status may increase the risk of infection due to\r\nmalnutrition and primary or secondary endocrine disorders,\r\nTABLE 1 Timeline of events.\r\nClinical\r\ncourse\r\nClinical features Imaging results Biology results Antimicrobial\r\ntherapy\r\nDrug and dose\r\nD0 Preparation of\r\nchemotherapy\r\nNeutropenia Normal brain and chest\r\nCT\r\nPositive of ETV6-\r\nRUNX1 fusion\r\nEmpiric antibiotic\r\ntherapy\r\nPiperacillin sodium and\r\ntazobactam sodium 112.5mg/\r\nkg.dose, q8h intravenously\r\nD1 Start of\r\nchemotherapy\r\n(Dex)\r\nNo fever Normal WBC\r\nNormal CRP\r\nProphylaxis for PCP Sulfamethoxazole Tablets 50mg/kg/\r\nday, twice a week, intravenously\r\nD5 Continued of\r\nchemotherapy\r\n(Pred)\r\nRaised of ANC Normal WBC and CRP\r\nD14 Persistence of\r\nneutropenia\r\nAdding antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nMicafungin 50 mg/day\r\nintravenously\r\nD19 Negative of bone marrow\r\nMRD\r\nNegative of ETV6-\r\nRUNX1 fusion\r\nD23 Oral pain\r\nRaised of CRP\r\nAgranulocytosis\r\nPositive oral secretion\r\ncultures for Burkholderia\r\npolyphagy\r\nSwitch antibiotherapy\r\nTienam 30 mg/kg.dose, q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nD28 Discontinued of\r\nchemotherapy\r\nFebrile neutropenia\r\nPositive for rhinovirus\r\nand gram positive coccus\r\nRising of CRP and PCT\r\nNegative of Blood\r\nculture, GM,G test\r\nAdding antibiotherapy\r\nVancomycin 10mg/kg.dose q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nD30 Persistence of fever,\r\ncough, dyspnea, and face\r\nswelling\r\nAbnormal chest CT scan Negative of CSF test Switch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nVoriconazole 4 mg/kg.dose q12h\r\nintravenously\r\nD34 High level of CRP Positive of mNGS in\r\nblood and sputum:\r\nLichtheimia ramosa;\r\nNegative of mNGS in\r\nCSF\r\nSwitch antibiotherapy\r\ncombined with\r\nTienam\r\nSwitch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nLinezolid 10 mg/kg.dose q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nAmphotericin B 0.2 mg/kg/\r\nday!1.5 mg/kg/day gradually with\r\n4 days, intravenously\r\nD35 Supplementation\r\nof potassium\r\nTransient hypokalemia Larger of lesions on image\r\non D38\r\nNormal of renal function\r\nD44 Temperature back to\r\nnormal\r\nWithdraw linezolid\r\nD52 Repeat CT on\r\nD52\r\nCTA on D65\r\nMDT meeting\r\nSurgery recommended More larger of lesions on\r\nCT\r\nNo regression of lesions\r\nand fungal flora in blood\r\nvessel on CTA\r\nDecreased of CRP Antifungal\r\ncombined therapy\r\nSwitch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nPosaconazole 6mg/kg.dose q6h,oral\r\nPiperacillin sodium and\r\ntazobactam sodium 112.5mg/\r\nkg.dose, q8h, intravenously\r\nD66 Surgery Fungal cenobium and\r\nfilamentous fungi found\r\nin the lung\r\nPositive for PAS and\r\nGomori methenamine\r\nsilver stain\r\nD84 Started the\r\nsecond induction\r\ntherapy\r\nRegression of lesions on\r\nimage\r\nD104 Leukemia relapse Regression of lesions on\r\nimage METHOTREXATE\r\nWithdraw\r\namphotericin B\r\nWBC, white blood cell counts; CRP, C-reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; Dex, dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 per day, 4 days); Pred, prednisone (45 mg/m2 per day, 24 days); MRD,\r\nminimal residual disease; PCP, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; BM, bone marrow; GM, galactomannan antigen test; G test, 1,3-b-D glucan test; PCT,\r\nprocalcitonin; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; mNGS, metagenomic next-generation sequencing; MDT, multidisciplinary team; CTA, computer tomography angiography; PAS, periodic acid\r\nSchiff.\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 05 frontiersin.org\r\nsuch as diabetes. Normal blood glucose levels were monitored, as\r\nwas her nutrition level. During the diagnosis and treatment of\r\nthe patient, blood glucose and urine glucose levels were\r\nmonitored regularly. Strengthening nutritional support is\r\nbeneficial for improving the prognosis.\r\nEarly detection is critical for avoiding the aggressive clinical\r\ncourse and improving prognosis. The diagnosis is based on a\r\ncombination of clinical examinations and histopathologic and\r\nradiological investigations. A biopsy and cultures on standard\r\nmycological media are typically required for a definitive\r\ndiagnosis (26, 27). With the progression of the disease,\r\npersistent fever and respiratory system symptom may occur.\r\nWhile the early symptoms are not typical, they cannot be\r\ndistinguished from other infective causes from other\r\npathogens. Although CT data may be suggestive, they are\r\nfrequently non-specific (27–29). As recommended by the ECIL\r\nguidelines, we also wanted to screen for intracranial infection,\r\nincluding the possibility of endocardial infection. In fact, we\r\nrecommend that cranial imaging be as complete as possible, even\r\nif the patient does not have neurological signs and symptoms.\r\nAdditionally, proper tissue sampling was performed mostly after\r\na delay for the fungal detection. Microscopically, rhizoids are\r\nrarely observed on Lichtheimia strains. Bronchoalveolar lavage\r\nfluid (BAL fluid) and sputum cultures are clinically much\r\nfeasible and safer than tissue biopsy (13, 30). Diagnosis of\r\nmucormycosis is often missed or delayed. In our case, the\r\nparents refused BALF due to risk. It is difficult to detect\r\nLichtheimia ramosa using traditional etiological detection\r\nmethods. Definitive identification requires molecular methods.\r\nmNGS is a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic method. Using\r\nmNGS as soon as possible is recommended when an infection\r\nwith a rare pathogen is suspected, especially in\r\nimmunocompromised individuals who need emergency\r\ntreatment (31, 32). Early clinical trials of patients with\r\nmeningitis or encephalitis, invasive fungal infections,\r\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, and other clinical\r\nindications revealed the potential of direct-from-specimen\r\nmNGS in enabling a difficult infection diagnosis. However, in\r\npublished studies, the proportion of patient cases having a\r\npositive clinical impact as a result of mNGS testing is low, and\r\nthe expense of testing is high, emphasizing the importance of\r\nimproving our understanding of “when to test” and for which\r\npatients mNGS testing is appropriate (33–36). In our case, we\r\nused mNGS for detecting this rare species. It enabled us to\r\neffectively treat this child patient with lung mycosis caused by a\r\nLichtheimia ramosa infection.\r\nAccording to our literature review, the empiric antifungal\r\ntreatment of Lichtheimia ramosa mucormycosis is amphotericin\r\nB and posaconazole. Lichtheimia is usually sensitive to\r\namphotericin B and posaconazole. Amphotericin B is the most\r\nactive drug against Lichtheimia species and is the only antifungal\r\nagent recommended in pediatric mucormycosis (37–39).\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) is a standard of care for a\r\nwide range of medically important opportunistic fungal\r\npathogens. LAmB has a significantly improved toxicity profile\r\ncompared with conventional amphotericin B. However, the\r\nadverse effects and especially nephrotoxicity of amphotericin\r\nB, even with the liposomal formulation, could be problematic.\r\nTABLE 2 Lichtheimia ramosa-related mucormycosis based on available case reports.\r\nDavid Navarro Cateau Suzuki\r\nAge (years) 10 27 8\r\nSex Female Male Male\r\nBaseline diagnosis AML AML AML\r\nRelapse Second relapse No First relapse\r\nChromosomal or genetic abnormalities Data missing 46 XY [23]/47 XY, ?4 [10] No\r\nPersistent febrile neutropenia Yes Yes Yes\r\nAntifungal or anti-mold prophylaxis Yes Yes Yes\r\nPresence of symptoms\r\nFever\r\nCough\r\nOthers\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nDyspnea\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nChills\r\nNo\r\nNo\r\nRight chest pain\r\nBloody sputum\r\nNephritis-like symptoms\r\nType of infection site Pulmonary Skin Pulmonary\r\nCerebral\r\nGM/G test Positive (GM) Data missing Negative (G test)\r\nProven mold infection/specimen BAL fluid necrosis samples culture Sputum culture\r\nTreatment for mycosis Amphotericin B\r\nPosaconazole\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B\r\nposaconazole\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B\r\nStem cell transplantation\r\nSurgery No No No\r\nOutcome Death Death Death\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 06 frontiersin.org\r\nMoreover, amphotericin B liposomes were not available in the\r\nregion of China, so we had to choose conventional amphotericin\r\nB and tried to exclude the intracranial fungal infection. However,\r\nit also has many side effects, which even causes the suspension of\r\nantifungal therapy. According to our experience, it usually\r\ncauses severe vomiting and electrolyte disorder to start with\r\nthe therapeutic dose on day 1, so we tried to increase the dose\r\ngradually. As we hoped, the intolerance of the patient was good.\r\nHer renal function was persistently normal, and she suffered\r\ntransient mild hypokalemia only.\r\nPosaconazole, possibly the recommended oral therapy, can\r\nbe used to complement or substitute amphotericin B therapy (3,\r\n40–42). However, there is no intravenous therapy, and it is not\r\neasy to monitor the blood drug concentration. The effectiveness\r\nof posaconazole is still controversial (43). It has been reported\r\nthat voriconazole has no activity against Lichtheimia ramosa.\r\nIsavuconazole has been approved for adults as first-line therapy\r\nif amphotericin B treatment is not appropriate (21, 44).\r\nIsavuconazole has rarely been reported to be used in children\r\nwith mucormycosis (45). As recommended by the guidelines,\r\nappropriate use of antifungal agents includes dosage, route of\r\nadministration, and monitoring of blood concentration. We do\r\nwant to monitor posaconazole blood concentrations, and we\r\nwant to use an intravenous preparation when amphotericin B is\r\ncombined with posaconazole during the patient’s hospital stay.\r\nHowever, due to the limited conditions, posaconazole\r\nintravenous preparations could not be obtained at that time,\r\nnor could blood drug concentration monitoring TDM be done.\r\nThat is something we need to work on. It is also recommended\r\nthat blood concentrations (effective therapeutic concentration)\r\nbe monitored as much as possible. It has been reported that\r\nechinocandin (micafungin and caspofungin) in combination\r\nwith amphotericin B also has a certain effect (42).\r\nMucormycosis is treated with a combination of antifungal\r\nmedications and surgical debridement of affected tissues.\r\nSurgery has been demonstrated to improve patient survival\r\n(43). Moreover, a combination strategy of intravenous\r\ninhalation and local inhalation and direct airway perfusion of\r\namphotericin B may be an effective strategy for the treatment of\r\npulmonary mucormycosis (46, 47). In our case, intravenous\r\nliposomal amphotericin B was started just after appearance of\r\nsuspicious clinical presentation and radiological findings\r\nsupporting mucormycosis. The patient was then given\r\nposaconazole in conjunction with amphotericin B, as well as\r\nprompt surgical debridement. Lichtheimia ramosa has\r\ncharacteristics comparable to invasive aspergillosis, including\r\nthe potential for angioinvasion and dissemination (1, 48).\r\nExtensive angioinvasion results in tissue necrosis (49).\r\nPulmonary hemorrhage, hemoptysis, asphyxia, and\r\nintracranial infection should be watched out for during\r\ndiagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, the patient had no\r\npulmonary hemorrhage and no abnormal cranial imaging and\r\nCSF findings. If IFD is diagnosed, antifungal treatment should be\r\nstarted immediately, and chemotherapy should be postponed\r\nuntil the IFD is under control, except in rare cases needing\r\nprompt anti-leukemic intervention. During the treatment, renal\r\nwork and electrolyte (low potassium) were closely monitored\r\n(24). In this case, renal function was normal. She had transient\r\nhypokalemia, improved by oral and intravenous potassium\r\nsupplementation and improved diet. In addition, the prompt\r\nrecovery of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is also\r\nnecessary. Fortunately, the child in this case had low-risk ALL\r\nwith sustained CR in BM after experiencing induction remission\r\ntherapy. Since the risk factors for infection in this patient are of\r\nconcern, ALL with Lichtheimia ramosa infection is extremely\r\nrare. The patient received amphotericin B monotherapy for 5\r\nweeks, amphotericin B+ posaconazole for 4 weeks, and then\r\nposaconazole monotherapy. The specific doses are shown in the\r\nattached table. She then had entered the maintain chemotherapy\r\nof the CCCG-ALL-2020 therapy for the low-risk group and stop\r\nusing antifungal drugs. During long-term follow-up, blood\r\nroutine test, CRP test, and CT were taken. The head and chest\r\nCT scans were all normal. The parents and children had good\r\ncompliance and tolerance.\r\nConclusion\r\nHere, we report a rare case of an infrequent fungal mycosis\r\nassociated with the causal species (Lichtheimia ramosa) in a\r\nchild ALL and review Lichtheimia ramosa-related mycosis based\r\non published case reports. This report summarizes the difficulty\r\nof making an early diagnosis and the importance of considering\r\nmucormycosis in subjects developing fever unresponsive to\r\nother antimicrobials and have breathing difficulty. The timing\r\nof proper medical therapy with antifungal medications and early\r\nsurgical resection is critical. mNGS is more effective when used\r\nearly in the diagnostic process.\r\nData availability satement\r\nThe original contributions presented in the study are\r\nincluded in the article/supplementary material.

It usually acts as an opportunistic pathogen,\r\nmostly in immunocompromised patients, and is aggressive with\r\nhigh mortality and morbidity rates (1, 4, 5). IFD is more\r\ncommon in patients with acute myeloid leukemia than in\r\nthose with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, a\r\nrecent study had shown that despite the recent breathtaking\r\ndevelopment of antifungal drugs, patients of ALL with\r\nprolonged neutropenia were also associated with a higher risk\r\nof acquiring IFD (6, 7).\r\nMucoraceae are classified into filamentous fungi.\r\nLichtheimia ramosa, formerly known as Absidia idahoensis,\r\nbelongs to the order of Mucorales and is currently regarded as\r\nan emerging pathogen (8–11). Mucormycosis caused by\r\nLichtheimia species has increased from 5% to more than 19%\r\nin the last decade, and it is associated with dissemination and\r\nlife-threatening complications (12–14). Cases have been\r\nreported in patients with diabetes, severe burns, chronic\r\ngranulomatous disease, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\r\nThe infections often develop rapidly and can potentially be\r\nangioinvasive, predominantly with pulmonary manifestations\r\n(13, 15). However, the early symptoms are unusual, and\r\ntraditional etiological detection methods are ineffective.\r\nClinically, most Lichtheimia infections were treated empirically\r\nwith no definite diagnosis (16, 17). Early diagnosis and\r\ntreatment can result in a better prognosis (4).\r\nHere, we first report a case of lung mucormycosis in a child\r\nfollowing induction chemotherapy for B-cell ALL. This is the\r\nfirst known published case of a child surviving pulmonary\r\nmucormycosis caused by Lichtheimia ramosa after prompt\r\nantifungal medication and aggressive surgical treatment.\r\nCase description\r\nA 3-year-old girl was admitted to West China Second\r\nUniversity Hospital who presented with fever and a pale\r\nappearance and diagnosed with early precursor B-cell ALL\r\nwith ETV6-RUNX1 fusion after MICM (morphology,\r\nimmunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology)\r\nclassification. No chromosomal abnormality was detected.\r\nBefore chemotherapy, the brain and chest computed\r\ntomography (CT) scan showed a negative result (Figures 1A,\r\nB). The patient was stratified into the low-risk group and\r\nsuccessfully treated with induction therapy using the Chinese\r\nChildren Cancer Group 2020 (CCCG-ALL-2020) protocol. It\r\nconsisted of dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 per day, 4 days),\r\nprednisone (45 mg/m2 per day, 24 days), vincristine,\r\ndaunorubicin, pegaspargase, and intrathecal injection of\r\ncytarabine, methotrexate (MTX), and dexamethasone (triple\r\nIT) in our hospital. The bone marrow response on day 19\r\n(calculated from the start of chemotherapy) was evaluated\r\nusing bone marrow aspiration and minimal residual disease\r\n(MRD). The bone marrow smear suggested complete remission,\r\nand the MRD was negative (<0.01%). ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene\r\nwas negative.\r\nDuring the first course of induction chemotherapy, the\r\npatient experienced significant neutropenia for 21 days. On\r\nday 1, piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium were given\r\nFIGURE 1\r\nBrain and Chest CT before and after surgery. (A) Brain CT before chemotherapy; (B) Chest CT before chemotherapy; (C) Day 30, a nodular\r\nlesion (3.2 cm × 2.8 cm, red arrow) in the post-basal segment of the left lower lobe with ground glass opacification; (D) Day 38, the initial\r\nnodular lesion was larger, and new lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung; (E, F). Day 52, the initial nodular lesion was 4.7 cm × 24.3 cm with\r\npart consolidation and the balloon cavity; the initial regional hazy shadow was spread diffusely in the left lung.

On day 23, she complained of oral pain.\r\nOn presentation, her neutrophil count was 0.02 × 109/l with\r\nraised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 19.2 mg/l. Due to positive oral\r\nsecretion cultures for Burkholderia polyphagy, the antibiotic\r\ntherapy was switched to Tienam. On day 28, she complained\r\nof a fever (38.3°C), followed by a cough, dyspnea, and swelling of\r\nthe face on day 30. Chemotherapy was discontinued. Results of\r\nthe blood culture, serum galactomannan antigen (GM) test, and\r\n1,3-b-D glucan test (G test) were negative. The patient was\r\npositive for rhinovirus in the throat swab and gram-positive\r\ncoccus in the sputum smear. A blood count indicated that the\r\npatient had severe neutropenia (<0.05 × 109/l). Procalcitonin\r\nand serum CRP levels were 1.73 ng/ml and 176.3 mg/l,\r\nrespectively. Chest CT showed a nodular lesion (3.2 cm ×\r\n2.8 cm) in the post-basal segment of the left lower lobe with\r\nground glass opacification (Figure 1C). The CT scans of the\r\nabdomen, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid test, all showed\r\nnormal results. However, the parents later refused for the patient\r\nto undergo head CT examination due to economic reasons.\r\nGiven the possibility of an opportunistic pathogen infiltrating\r\nthe fungi prophylaxis and causing pulmonary infection, the\r\nantifungal therapy was changed to voriconazole, added with\r\nvancomycin. However, the high fever and dyspnea persisted. On\r\nday 34, the CRP increased to 301.8 mg/l, and following positive\r\nevolution with metagenomic next-generation sequencing\r\n(mNGS) (identified by Hugo Biotech, China, free testing) in\r\nthe genomic DNA of the blood and sputum specimen,\r\nLichtheimia ramosa was detected. Meanwhile, mNGS\r\nidentified gram-positive streptococcus in the sputum specimen\r\nbut no pathogenic prokaryotic microorganisms or viruses in the\r\nblood specimen. mNGS in cerebrospinal fluid specimens was\r\nalso performed to determine intracranial IFD, although the\r\nresults were negative. Because the test results were consistent\r\nwith the clinical manifestations, we adjusted the antifungal\r\ntreatment regimen to amphotericin B (amphotericin B\r\nliposomes were not available) intravenously (the initial dose\r\nwas 0.2 mg/kg and increased up to 1.5 mg/kg gradually within 4\r\ndays); the therapeutic dose was administered intravenously for 9\r\nweeks. The antibiotic therapy was switched to linezolid\r\ncombined with Tienam. Meanwhile, the renal function was\r\nmonitored and found to be normal. She experienced transient\r\nhypokalemia (2.33 mmol/l, normal range 3.5–5.5 mmol/l),\r\nwhich was resolved with oral and intravenous potassium\r\nsupplementation. On day 38, repeated CT showed a larger\r\ninitial nodular lesion and a new lesion in the upper lobe of the\r\nright lung (Figure 1D). On day 44, the patient’s temperature was\r\nback to normal. On day 52, a repeat CT revealed that the initial\r\nnodular lesion had gotten larger (4.7 cm × 24.3 cm) with part\r\nconsolidation and that the initial regional hazy shadow had\r\ndisseminated diffusely in the left lung. New regional shadows\r\nwere seen in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figures 1E, F).\r\nComputer tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted and\r\ndemonstrated no fungal flora in the blood vessels (Figure 1G). A\r\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) met the recommended surgical\r\ntreatment for the patient. Meanwhile, posaconazole was added\r\n(6 mg/kg oral q6h) combined with amphotericin B. The blood\r\nconcentration of posaconazole was in the normal range. On day\r\n66, surgical management involved the lower lobe of the left lung\r\nand pleura (Figure 1H). The yellow and white fungal lesions in\r\nthe basal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung were observed\r\nduring surgery. Irregular fungal balls (3.0 cm) and necrosis\r\nlesions were observed in the pulmonary alveoli. A microscopic\r\nexamination revealed tissue necrosis (Figures 2A, B), fungal\r\ncenobium in the pulmonary alveoli (Figure 2C), and\r\nfilamentous fungi in the removed pulmonary specimen\r\n(Figure 2D). It was positive for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain\r\n(Figure 2E) and Gomori methenamine silver stain (Figure 2F)\r\nbut negative for acid-fast stain. On day 84, the patient started the\r\nsecond induction therapy with cyclophosphamide cytarabine\r\nand mercaptopurine. The chemotherapy was completed\r\nwithout the recurrence of the fungal infection. After every 3\r\nmonths of follow-up, the patient was sequentially treated with\r\nposaconazole and was continuously in complete remission.\r\nThere was no progression of mucormycosis in the chest CT\r\n(Figure 1J) on 6 months after surgery. Brain CT was conducted\r\nafter active persuasion, and it showed a good image (Figure 1I).\r\nThe clinical course and timeline of the treatment course are\r\nsummarized in Figure 3 and Table 1.\r\nDiscussion and review of\r\nthe literature\r\nMucormycosis is an opportunistic invasive fungal infection\r\ncaused by Mucoralean and zygomycetes fungus, like the\r\nLichtheimia species. This fungus is found almost ubiquitously\r\nin soil, farming products, and processed and unprocessed food\r\nproducts (12, 18). Despite being classified as a low-virulence\r\npathogen, the percentage of Mucor infections caused by\r\nLichtheimia species has increased from 5% to more than 19%\r\nin the last decade, according to recent reviews (13, 19).\r\nLichtheimia ramosa is the most common pathogenic\r\nLichtheimia species and a leading cause of mucormycosis (15).\r\nThe clinical disease resembles infections with other mucoralean\r\nfungi. The pulmonary is the most common organ infected by\r\nLichtheimia ramosa. Cutaneous and subcutaneous were also\r\nobserved in some cases (18). Most patients with serious\r\nmucormycosis underlying diseases, such as hematological\r\nmalignancies, are predominantly at risk (1). Classically, the\r\nrisk of mucormycosis has been considered higher in AML and\r\nHSCT than in ALL (20–22). In this study, reports about\r\nLichtheimia ramosa mucormycosis in leukemia published in\r\nliterature were reviewed. Here, we performed a detailed review of\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 03 frontiersin.org\r\nLichtheimia ramosa-induced mucormycosis events in leukemia\r\nbased on available case reports (Table 2). For the cases reviewed,\r\nthere have been rare reports of Lichtheimia ramosa infection in\r\nleukemia (23–25). The three cases were all reported with AML,\r\nwith one case including an adult patient’s skin mucormycosis.\r\nThe other child with AML had pulmonary and cerebral\r\nmucormycosis caused by Lichtheimia ramosa. However, the\r\nepisode was rare in ALL for the patient infected with\r\nLichtheimia ramosa. This is the first reported case of pediatric\r\nALL in our study. Risk factors are indeed a matter of great\r\nconcern to us. A thorough search for risk factors can aid in the\r\nreduction of opportunistic infections and improve patient\r\nFIGURE 3\r\nThe clinical course of the patient. The patient had fever on day 28 and persistent fever for several days. Fever subsided after amphotericin B and\r\nposaconazole treatment. The ANC and CRP data were also obtained. The temperature was gradually increased on day 23 and peaked on day\r\n34. A blood count revealed persistence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia on day 30. On day 66, surgical management was performed. On\r\nday 84, the patient started the second induction therapy.\r\nFIGURE 2\r\nMicroscopic examination of the removed lung. (A-D).

In the case of our patient, it would be reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the infection occurrence was related to\r\nimmunocompromised status induced by hematological\r\nmalignancies; the ETV6-RUNX1 gene is a marker of good\r\nprognosis for ALL. However, clinical studies have shown that\r\nALL patients carrying this gene are more susceptible to severe\r\nopportunistic infections, which may be associated with high\r\nsusceptibility to chemotherapy, resulting in long-term severe\r\ngranulocytosis. For this patient, in addition to the above risk\r\nfactors, living near garbage sites, vegetable markets, and flower\r\nshops as well as poor sanitation may increase the risk of fungal\r\ninfection. At the same time, long-term poor appetite and poor\r\nnutritional status may increase the risk of infection due to\r\nmalnutrition and primary or secondary endocrine disorders,\r\nTABLE 1 Timeline of events.\r\nClinical\r\ncourse\r\nClinical features Imaging results Biology results Antimicrobial\r\ntherapy\r\nDrug and dose\r\nD0 Preparation of\r\nchemotherapy\r\nNeutropenia Normal brain and chest\r\nCT\r\nPositive of ETV6-\r\nRUNX1 fusion\r\nEmpiric antibiotic\r\ntherapy\r\nPiperacillin sodium and\r\ntazobactam sodium 112.5mg/\r\nkg.dose, q8h intravenously\r\nD1 Start of\r\nchemotherapy\r\n(Dex)\r\nNo fever Normal WBC\r\nNormal CRP\r\nProphylaxis for PCP Sulfamethoxazole Tablets 50mg/kg/\r\nday, twice a week, intravenously\r\nD5 Continued of\r\nchemotherapy\r\n(Pred)\r\nRaised of ANC Normal WBC and CRP\r\nD14 Persistence of\r\nneutropenia\r\nAdding antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nMicafungin 50 mg/day\r\nintravenously\r\nD19 Negative of bone marrow\r\nMRD\r\nNegative of ETV6-\r\nRUNX1 fusion\r\nD23 Oral pain\r\nRaised of CRP\r\nAgranulocytosis\r\nPositive oral secretion\r\ncultures for Burkholderia\r\npolyphagy\r\nSwitch antibiotherapy\r\nTienam 30 mg/kg.dose, q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nD28 Discontinued of\r\nchemotherapy\r\nFebrile neutropenia\r\nPositive for rhinovirus\r\nand gram positive coccus\r\nRising of CRP and PCT\r\nNegative of Blood\r\nculture, GM,G test\r\nAdding antibiotherapy\r\nVancomycin 10mg/kg.dose q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nD30 Persistence of fever,\r\ncough, dyspnea, and face\r\nswelling\r\nAbnormal chest CT scan Negative of CSF test Switch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nVoriconazole 4 mg/kg.dose q12h\r\nintravenously\r\nD34 High level of CRP Positive of mNGS in\r\nblood and sputum:\r\nLichtheimia ramosa;\r\nNegative of mNGS in\r\nCSF\r\nSwitch antibiotherapy\r\ncombined with\r\nTienam\r\nSwitch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nLinezolid 10 mg/kg.dose q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nAmphotericin B 0.2 mg/kg/\r\nday!1.5 mg/kg/day gradually with\r\n4 days, intravenously\r\nD35 Supplementation\r\nof potassium\r\nTransient hypokalemia Larger of lesions on image\r\non D38\r\nNormal of renal function\r\nD44 Temperature back to\r\nnormal\r\nWithdraw linezolid\r\nD52 Repeat CT on\r\nD52\r\nCTA on D65\r\nMDT meeting\r\nSurgery recommended More larger of lesions on\r\nCT\r\nNo regression of lesions\r\nand fungal flora in blood\r\nvessel on CTA\r\nDecreased of CRP Antifungal\r\ncombined therapy\r\nSwitch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nPosaconazole 6mg/kg.dose q6h,oral\r\nPiperacillin sodium and\r\ntazobactam sodium 112.5mg/\r\nkg.dose, q8h, intravenously\r\nD66 Surgery Fungal cenobium and\r\nfilamentous fungi found\r\nin the lung\r\nPositive for PAS and\r\nGomori methenamine\r\nsilver stain\r\nD84 Started the\r\nsecond induction\r\ntherapy\r\nRegression of lesions on\r\nimage\r\nD104 Leukemia relapse Regression of lesions on\r\nimage METHOTREXATE\r\nWithdraw\r\namphotericin B\r\nWBC, white blood cell counts; CRP, C-reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; Dex, dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 per day, 4 days); Pred, prednisone (45 mg/m2 per day, 24 days); MRD,\r\nminimal residual disease; PCP, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; BM, bone marrow; GM, galactomannan antigen test; G test, 1,3-b-D glucan test; PCT,\r\nprocalcitonin; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; mNGS, metagenomic next-generation sequencing; MDT, multidisciplinary team; CTA, computer tomography angiography; PAS, periodic acid\r\nSchiff.\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 05 frontiersin.org\r\nsuch as diabetes. Normal blood glucose levels were monitored, as\r\nwas her nutrition level. During the diagnosis and treatment of\r\nthe patient, blood glucose and urine glucose levels were\r\nmonitored regularly. Strengthening nutritional support is\r\nbeneficial for improving the prognosis.\r\nEarly detection is critical for avoiding the aggressive clinical\r\ncourse and improving prognosis. The diagnosis is based on a\r\ncombination of clinical examinations and histopathologic and\r\nradiological investigations. A biopsy and cultures on standard\r\nmycological media are typically required for a definitive\r\ndiagnosis (26, 27). With the progression of the disease,\r\npersistent fever and respiratory system symptom may occur.\r\nWhile the early symptoms are not typical, they cannot be\r\ndistinguished from other infective causes from other\r\npathogens. Although CT data may be suggestive, they are\r\nfrequently non-specific (27–29). As recommended by the ECIL\r\nguidelines, we also wanted to screen for intracranial infection,\r\nincluding the possibility of endocardial infection. In fact, we\r\nrecommend that cranial imaging be as complete as possible, even\r\nif the patient does not have neurological signs and symptoms.\r\nAdditionally, proper tissue sampling was performed mostly after\r\na delay for the fungal detection. Microscopically, rhizoids are\r\nrarely observed on Lichtheimia strains. Bronchoalveolar lavage\r\nfluid (BAL fluid) and sputum cultures are clinically much\r\nfeasible and safer than tissue biopsy (13, 30). Diagnosis of\r\nmucormycosis is often missed or delayed. In our case, the\r\nparents refused BALF due to risk. It is difficult to detect\r\nLichtheimia ramosa using traditional etiological detection\r\nmethods. Definitive identification requires molecular methods.\r\nmNGS is a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic method. Using\r\nmNGS as soon as possible is recommended when an infection\r\nwith a rare pathogen is suspected, especially in\r\nimmunocompromised individuals who need emergency\r\ntreatment (31, 32). Early clinical trials of patients with\r\nmeningitis or encephalitis, invasive fungal infections,\r\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, and other clinical\r\nindications revealed the potential of direct-from-specimen\r\nmNGS in enabling a difficult infection diagnosis. However, in\r\npublished studies, the proportion of patient cases having a\r\npositive clinical impact as a result of mNGS testing is low, and\r\nthe expense of testing is high, emphasizing the importance of\r\nimproving our understanding of “when to test” and for which\r\npatients mNGS testing is appropriate (33–36). In our case, we\r\nused mNGS for detecting this rare species. It enabled us to\r\neffectively treat this child patient with lung mycosis caused by a\r\nLichtheimia ramosa infection.\r\nAccording to our literature review, the empiric antifungal\r\ntreatment of Lichtheimia ramosa mucormycosis is amphotericin\r\nB and posaconazole. Lichtheimia is usually sensitive to\r\namphotericin B and posaconazole. Amphotericin B is the most\r\nactive drug against Lichtheimia species and is the only antifungal\r\nagent recommended in pediatric mucormycosis (37–39).\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) is a standard of care for a\r\nwide range of medically important opportunistic fungal\r\npathogens. LAmB has a significantly improved toxicity profile\r\ncompared with conventional amphotericin B. However, the\r\nadverse effects and especially nephrotoxicity of amphotericin\r\nB, even with the liposomal formulation, could be problematic.\r\nTABLE 2 Lichtheimia ramosa-related mucormycosis based on available case reports.\r\nDavid Navarro Cateau Suzuki\r\nAge (years) 10 27 8\r\nSex Female Male Male\r\nBaseline diagnosis AML AML AML\r\nRelapse Second relapse No First relapse\r\nChromosomal or genetic abnormalities Data missing 46 XY [23]/47 XY, ?4 [10] No\r\nPersistent febrile neutropenia Yes Yes Yes\r\nAntifungal or anti-mold prophylaxis Yes Yes Yes\r\nPresence of symptoms\r\nFever\r\nCough\r\nOthers\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nDyspnea\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nChills\r\nNo\r\nNo\r\nRight chest pain\r\nBloody sputum\r\nNephritis-like symptoms\r\nType of infection site Pulmonary Skin Pulmonary\r\nCerebral\r\nGM/G test Positive (GM) Data missing Negative (G test)\r\nProven mold infection/specimen BAL fluid necrosis samples culture Sputum culture\r\nTreatment for mycosis Amphotericin B\r\nPosaconazole\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B\r\nposaconazole\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B\r\nStem cell transplantation\r\nSurgery No No No\r\nOutcome Death Death Death\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 06 frontiersin.org\r\nMoreover, amphotericin B liposomes were not available in the\r\nregion of China, so we had to choose conventional amphotericin\r\nB and tried to exclude the intracranial fungal infection. However,\r\nit also has many side effects, which even causes the suspension of\r\nantifungal therapy. According to our experience, it usually\r\ncauses severe vomiting and electrolyte disorder to start with\r\nthe therapeutic dose on day 1, so we tried to increase the dose\r\ngradually. As we hoped, the intolerance of the patient was good.\r\nHer renal function was persistently normal, and she suffered\r\ntransient mild hypokalemia only.\r\nPosaconazole, possibly the recommended oral therapy, can\r\nbe used to complement or substitute amphotericin B therapy (3,\r\n40–42). However, there is no intravenous therapy, and it is not\r\neasy to monitor the blood drug concentration. The effectiveness\r\nof posaconazole is still controversial (43). It has been reported\r\nthat voriconazole has no activity against Lichtheimia ramosa.\r\nIsavuconazole has been approved for adults as first-line therapy\r\nif amphotericin B treatment is not appropriate (21, 44).\r\nIsavuconazole has rarely been reported to be used in children\r\nwith mucormycosis (45). As recommended by the guidelines,\r\nappropriate use of antifungal agents includes dosage, route of\r\nadministration, and monitoring of blood concentration. We do\r\nwant to monitor posaconazole blood concentrations, and we\r\nwant to use an intravenous preparation when amphotericin B is\r\ncombined with posaconazole during the patient’s hospital stay.\r\nHowever, due to the limited conditions, posaconazole\r\nintravenous preparations could not be obtained at that time,\r\nnor could blood drug concentration monitoring TDM be done.\r\nThat is something we need to work on. It is also recommended\r\nthat blood concentrations (effective therapeutic concentration)\r\nbe monitored as much as possible. It has been reported that\r\nechinocandin (micafungin and caspofungin) in combination\r\nwith amphotericin B also has a certain effect (42).\r\nMucormycosis is treated with a combination of antifungal\r\nmedications and surgical debridement of affected tissues.\r\nSurgery has been demonstrated to improve patient survival\r\n(43). Moreover, a combination strategy of intravenous\r\ninhalation and local inhalation and direct airway perfusion of\r\namphotericin B may be an effective strategy for the treatment of\r\npulmonary mucormycosis (46, 47). In our case, intravenous\r\nliposomal amphotericin B was started just after appearance of\r\nsuspicious clinical presentation and radiological findings\r\nsupporting mucormycosis. The patient was then given\r\nposaconazole in conjunction with amphotericin B, as well as\r\nprompt surgical debridement. Lichtheimia ramosa has\r\ncharacteristics comparable to invasive aspergillosis, including\r\nthe potential for angioinvasion and dissemination (1, 48).\r\nExtensive angioinvasion results in tissue necrosis (49).\r\nPulmonary hemorrhage, hemoptysis, asphyxia, and\r\nintracranial infection should be watched out for during\r\ndiagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, the patient had no\r\npulmonary hemorrhage and no abnormal cranial imaging and\r\nCSF findings. If IFD is diagnosed, antifungal treatment should be\r\nstarted immediately, and chemotherapy should be postponed\r\nuntil the IFD is under control, except in rare cases needing\r\nprompt anti-leukemic intervention. During the treatment, renal\r\nwork and electrolyte (low potassium) were closely monitored\r\n(24). In this case, renal function was normal. She had transient\r\nhypokalemia, improved by oral and intravenous potassium\r\nsupplementation and improved diet. In addition, the prompt\r\nrecovery of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is also\r\nnecessary. Fortunately, the child in this case had low-risk ALL\r\nwith sustained CR in BM after experiencing induction remission\r\ntherapy. Since the risk factors for infection in this patient are of\r\nconcern, ALL with Lichtheimia ramosa infection is extremely\r\nrare. The patient received amphotericin B monotherapy for 5\r\nweeks, amphotericin B+ posaconazole for 4 weeks, and then\r\nposaconazole monotherapy. The specific doses are shown in the\r\nattached table. She then had entered the maintain chemotherapy\r\nof the CCCG-ALL-2020 therapy for the low-risk group and stop\r\nusing antifungal drugs. During long-term follow-up, blood\r\nroutine test, CRP test, and CT were taken. The head and chest\r\nCT scans were all normal. The parents and children had good\r\ncompliance and tolerance.\r\nConclusion\r\nHere, we report a rare case of an infrequent fungal mycosis\r\nassociated with the causal species (Lichtheimia ramosa) in a\r\nchild ALL and review Lichtheimia ramosa-related mycosis based\r\non published case reports. This report summarizes the difficulty\r\nof making an early diagnosis and the importance of considering\r\nmucormycosis in subjects developing fever unresponsive to\r\nother antimicrobials and have breathing difficulty. The timing\r\nof proper medical therapy with antifungal medications and early\r\nsurgical resection is critical. mNGS is more effective when used\r\nearly in the diagnostic process.\r\nData availability satement\r\nThe original contributions presented in the study are\r\nincluded in the article/supplementary material.

It usually acts as an opportunistic pathogen,\r\nmostly in immunocompromised patients, and is aggressive with\r\nhigh mortality and morbidity rates (1, 4, 5). IFD is more\r\ncommon in patients with acute myeloid leukemia than in\r\nthose with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, a\r\nrecent study had shown that despite the recent breathtaking\r\ndevelopment of antifungal drugs, patients of ALL with\r\nprolonged neutropenia were also associated with a higher risk\r\nof acquiring IFD (6, 7).\r\nMucoraceae are classified into filamentous fungi.\r\nLichtheimia ramosa, formerly known as Absidia idahoensis,\r\nbelongs to the order of Mucorales and is currently regarded as\r\nan emerging pathogen (8–11). Mucormycosis caused by\r\nLichtheimia species has increased from 5% to more than 19%\r\nin the last decade, and it is associated with dissemination and\r\nlife-threatening complications (12–14). Cases have been\r\nreported in patients with diabetes, severe burns, chronic\r\ngranulomatous disease, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\r\nThe infections often develop rapidly and can potentially be\r\nangioinvasive, predominantly with pulmonary manifestations\r\n(13, 15). However, the early symptoms are unusual, and\r\ntraditional etiological detection methods are ineffective.\r\nClinically, most Lichtheimia infections were treated empirically\r\nwith no definite diagnosis (16, 17). Early diagnosis and\r\ntreatment can result in a better prognosis (4).\r\nHere, we first report a case of lung mucormycosis in a child\r\nfollowing induction chemotherapy for B-cell ALL. This is the\r\nfirst known published case of a child surviving pulmonary\r\nmucormycosis caused by Lichtheimia ramosa after prompt\r\nantifungal medication and aggressive surgical treatment.\r\nCase description\r\nA 3-year-old girl was admitted to West China Second\r\nUniversity Hospital who presented with fever and a pale\r\nappearance and diagnosed with early precursor B-cell ALL\r\nwith ETV6-RUNX1 fusion after MICM (morphology,\r\nimmunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology)\r\nclassification. No chromosomal abnormality was detected.\r\nBefore chemotherapy, the brain and chest computed\r\ntomography (CT) scan showed a negative result (Figures 1A,\r\nB). The patient was stratified into the low-risk group and\r\nsuccessfully treated with induction therapy using the Chinese\r\nChildren Cancer Group 2020 (CCCG-ALL-2020) protocol. It\r\nconsisted of dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 per day, 4 days),\r\nprednisone (45 mg/m2 per day, 24 days), vincristine,\r\ndaunorubicin, pegaspargase, and intrathecal injection of\r\ncytarabine, methotrexate (MTX), and dexamethasone (triple\r\nIT) in our hospital. The bone marrow response on day 19\r\n(calculated from the start of chemotherapy) was evaluated\r\nusing bone marrow aspiration and minimal residual disease\r\n(MRD). The bone marrow smear suggested complete remission,\r\nand the MRD was negative (<0.01%). ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene\r\nwas negative.\r\nDuring the first course of induction chemotherapy, the\r\npatient experienced significant neutropenia for 21 days. On\r\nday 1, piperacillin sodium and tazobactam sodium were given\r\nFIGURE 1\r\nBrain and Chest CT before and after surgery.

On day 23, she complained of oral pain.\r\nOn presentation, her neutrophil count was 0.02 × 109/l with\r\nraised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 19.2 mg/l. Due to positive oral\r\nsecretion cultures for Burkholderia polyphagy, the antibiotic\r\ntherapy was switched to Tienam. On day 28, she complained\r\nof a fever (38.3°C), followed by a cough, dyspnea, and swelling of\r\nthe face on day 30. Chemotherapy was discontinued. Results of\r\nthe blood culture, serum galactomannan antigen (GM) test, and\r\n1,3-b-D glucan test (G test) were negative. The patient was\r\npositive for rhinovirus in the throat swab and gram-positive\r\ncoccus in the sputum smear. A blood count indicated that the\r\npatient had severe neutropenia (<0.05 × 109/l). Procalcitonin\r\nand serum CRP levels were 1.73 ng/ml and 176.3 mg/l,\r\nrespectively. Chest CT showed a nodular lesion (3.2 cm ×\r\n2.8 cm) in the post-basal segment of the left lower lobe with\r\nground glass opacification (Figure 1C). The CT scans of the\r\nabdomen, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid test, all showed\r\nnormal results. However, the parents later refused for the patient\r\nto undergo head CT examination due to economic reasons.\r\nGiven the possibility of an opportunistic pathogen infiltrating\r\nthe fungi prophylaxis and causing pulmonary infection, the\r\nantifungal therapy was changed to voriconazole, added with\r\nvancomycin. However, the high fever and dyspnea persisted. On\r\nday 34, the CRP increased to 301.8 mg/l, and following positive\r\nevolution with metagenomic next-generation sequencing\r\n(mNGS) (identified by Hugo Biotech, China, free testing) in\r\nthe genomic DNA of the blood and sputum specimen,\r\nLichtheimia ramosa was detected. Meanwhile, mNGS\r\nidentified gram-positive streptococcus in the sputum specimen\r\nbut no pathogenic prokaryotic microorganisms or viruses in the\r\nblood specimen. mNGS in cerebrospinal fluid specimens was\r\nalso performed to determine intracranial IFD, although the\r\nresults were negative. Because the test results were consistent\r\nwith the clinical manifestations, we adjusted the antifungal\r\ntreatment regimen to amphotericin B (amphotericin B\r\nliposomes were not available) intravenously (the initial dose\r\nwas 0.2 mg/kg and increased up to 1.5 mg/kg gradually within 4\r\ndays); the therapeutic dose was administered intravenously for 9\r\nweeks. The antibiotic therapy was switched to linezolid\r\ncombined with Tienam. Meanwhile, the renal function was\r\nmonitored and found to be normal. She experienced transient\r\nhypokalemia (2.33 mmol/l, normal range 3.5–5.5 mmol/l),\r\nwhich was resolved with oral and intravenous potassium\r\nsupplementation. On day 38, repeated CT showed a larger\r\ninitial nodular lesion and a new lesion in the upper lobe of the\r\nright lung (Figure 1D). On day 44, the patient’s temperature was\r\nback to normal. On day 52, a repeat CT revealed that the initial\r\nnodular lesion had gotten larger (4.7 cm × 24.3 cm) with part\r\nconsolidation and that the initial regional hazy shadow had\r\ndisseminated diffusely in the left lung. New regional shadows\r\nwere seen in the upper lobe of the right lung (Figures 1E, F).\r\nComputer tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted and\r\ndemonstrated no fungal flora in the blood vessels (Figure 1G). A\r\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) met the recommended surgical\r\ntreatment for the patient. Meanwhile, posaconazole was added\r\n(6 mg/kg oral q6h) combined with amphotericin B. The blood\r\nconcentration of posaconazole was in the normal range. On day\r\n66, surgical management involved the lower lobe of the left lung\r\nand pleura (Figure 1H). The yellow and white fungal lesions in\r\nthe basal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung were observed\r\nduring surgery. Irregular fungal balls (3.0 cm) and necrosis\r\nlesions were observed in the pulmonary alveoli. A microscopic\r\nexamination revealed tissue necrosis (Figures 2A, B), fungal\r\ncenobium in the pulmonary alveoli (Figure 2C), and\r\nfilamentous fungi in the removed pulmonary specimen\r\n(Figure 2D). It was positive for periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain\r\n(Figure 2E) and Gomori methenamine silver stain (Figure 2F)\r\nbut negative for acid-fast stain. On day 84, the patient started the\r\nsecond induction therapy with cyclophosphamide cytarabine\r\nand mercaptopurine. The chemotherapy was completed\r\nwithout the recurrence of the fungal infection. After every 3\r\nmonths of follow-up, the patient was sequentially treated with\r\nposaconazole and was continuously in complete remission.\r\nThere was no progression of mucormycosis in the chest CT\r\n(Figure 1J) on 6 months after surgery. Brain CT was conducted\r\nafter active persuasion, and it showed a good image (Figure 1I).\r\nThe clinical course and timeline of the treatment course are\r\nsummarized in Figure 3 and Table 1.\r\nDiscussion and review of\r\nthe literature\r\nMucormycosis is an opportunistic invasive fungal infection\r\ncaused by Mucoralean and zygomycetes fungus, like the\r\nLichtheimia species. This fungus is found almost ubiquitously\r\nin soil, farming products, and processed and unprocessed food\r\nproducts (12, 18). Despite being classified as a low-virulence\r\npathogen, the percentage of Mucor infections caused by\r\nLichtheimia species has increased from 5% to more than 19%\r\nin the last decade, according to recent reviews (13, 19).\r\nLichtheimia ramosa is the most common pathogenic\r\nLichtheimia species and a leading cause of mucormycosis (15).\r\nThe clinical disease resembles infections with other mucoralean\r\nfungi. The pulmonary is the most common organ infected by\r\nLichtheimia ramosa. Cutaneous and subcutaneous were also\r\nobserved in some cases (18). Most patients with serious\r\nmucormycosis underlying diseases, such as hematological\r\nmalignancies, are predominantly at risk (1). Classically, the\r\nrisk of mucormycosis has been considered higher in AML and\r\nHSCT than in ALL (20–22). In this study, reports about\r\nLichtheimia ramosa mucormycosis in leukemia published in\r\nliterature were reviewed. Here, we performed a detailed review of\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 03 frontiersin.org\r\nLichtheimia ramosa-induced mucormycosis events in leukemia\r\nbased on available case reports (Table 2). For the cases reviewed,\r\nthere have been rare reports of Lichtheimia ramosa infection in\r\nleukemia (23–25). The three cases were all reported with AML,\r\nwith one case including an adult patient’s skin mucormycosis.\r\nThe other child with AML had pulmonary and cerebral\r\nmucormycosis caused by Lichtheimia ramosa. However, the\r\nepisode was rare in ALL for the patient infected with\r\nLichtheimia ramosa. This is the first reported case of pediatric\r\nALL in our study. Risk factors are indeed a matter of great\r\nconcern to us. A thorough search for risk factors can aid in the\r\nreduction of opportunistic infections and improve patient\r\nFIGURE 3\r\nThe clinical course of the patient. The patient had fever on day 28 and persistent fever for several days. Fever subsided after amphotericin B and\r\nposaconazole treatment. The ANC and CRP data were also obtained. The temperature was gradually increased on day 23 and peaked on day\r\n34. A blood count revealed persistence of neutropenia and severe neutropenia on day 30. On day 66, surgical management was performed. On\r\nday 84, the patient started the second induction therapy.\r\nFIGURE 2\r\nMicroscopic examination of the removed lung. (A-D).

In the case of our patient, it would be reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the infection occurrence was related to\r\nimmunocompromised status induced by hematological\r\nmalignancies; the ETV6-RUNX1 gene is a marker of good\r\nprognosis for ALL. However, clinical studies have shown that\r\nALL patients carrying this gene are more susceptible to severe\r\nopportunistic infections, which may be associated with high\r\nsusceptibility to chemotherapy, resulting in long-term severe\r\ngranulocytosis. For this patient, in addition to the above risk\r\nfactors, living near garbage sites, vegetable markets, and flower\r\nshops as well as poor sanitation may increase the risk of fungal\r\ninfection. At the same time, long-term poor appetite and poor\r\nnutritional status may increase the risk of infection due to\r\nmalnutrition and primary or secondary endocrine disorders,\r\nTABLE 1 Timeline of events.\r\nClinical\r\ncourse\r\nClinical features Imaging results Biology results Antimicrobial\r\ntherapy\r\nDrug and dose\r\nD0 Preparation of\r\nchemotherapy\r\nNeutropenia Normal brain and chest\r\nCT\r\nPositive of ETV6-\r\nRUNX1 fusion\r\nEmpiric antibiotic\r\ntherapy\r\nPiperacillin sodium and\r\ntazobactam sodium 112.5mg/\r\nkg.dose, q8h intravenously\r\nD1 Start of\r\nchemotherapy\r\n(Dex)\r\nNo fever Normal WBC\r\nNormal CRP\r\nProphylaxis for PCP Sulfamethoxazole Tablets 50mg/kg/\r\nday, twice a week, intravenously\r\nD5 Continued of\r\nchemotherapy\r\n(Pred)\r\nRaised of ANC Normal WBC and CRP\r\nD14 Persistence of\r\nneutropenia\r\nAdding antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nMicafungin 50 mg/day\r\nintravenously\r\nD19 Negative of bone marrow\r\nMRD\r\nNegative of ETV6-\r\nRUNX1 fusion\r\nD23 Oral pain\r\nRaised of CRP\r\nAgranulocytosis\r\nPositive oral secretion\r\ncultures for Burkholderia\r\npolyphagy\r\nSwitch antibiotherapy\r\nTienam 30 mg/kg.dose, q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nD28 Discontinued of\r\nchemotherapy\r\nFebrile neutropenia\r\nPositive for rhinovirus\r\nand gram positive coccus\r\nRising of CRP and PCT\r\nNegative of Blood\r\nculture, GM,G test\r\nAdding antibiotherapy\r\nVancomycin 10mg/kg.dose q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nD30 Persistence of fever,\r\ncough, dyspnea, and face\r\nswelling\r\nAbnormal chest CT scan Negative of CSF test Switch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nVoriconazole 4 mg/kg.dose q12h\r\nintravenously\r\nD34 High level of CRP Positive of mNGS in\r\nblood and sputum:\r\nLichtheimia ramosa;\r\nNegative of mNGS in\r\nCSF\r\nSwitch antibiotherapy\r\ncombined with\r\nTienam\r\nSwitch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nLinezolid 10 mg/kg.dose q8h\r\nintravenously\r\nAmphotericin B 0.2 mg/kg/\r\nday!1.5 mg/kg/day gradually with\r\n4 days, intravenously\r\nD35 Supplementation\r\nof potassium\r\nTransient hypokalemia Larger of lesions on image\r\non D38\r\nNormal of renal function\r\nD44 Temperature back to\r\nnormal\r\nWithdraw linezolid\r\nD52 Repeat CT on\r\nD52\r\nCTA on D65\r\nMDT meeting\r\nSurgery recommended More larger of lesions on\r\nCT\r\nNo regression of lesions\r\nand fungal flora in blood\r\nvessel on CTA\r\nDecreased of CRP Antifungal\r\ncombined therapy\r\nSwitch antifungal\r\ntherapy\r\nPosaconazole 6mg/kg.dose q6h,oral\r\nPiperacillin sodium and\r\ntazobactam sodium 112.5mg/\r\nkg.dose, q8h, intravenously\r\nD66 Surgery Fungal cenobium and\r\nfilamentous fungi found\r\nin the lung\r\nPositive for PAS and\r\nGomori methenamine\r\nsilver stain\r\nD84 Started the\r\nsecond induction\r\ntherapy\r\nRegression of lesions on\r\nimage\r\nD104 Leukemia relapse Regression of lesions on\r\nimage METHOTREXATE\r\nWithdraw\r\namphotericin B\r\nWBC, white blood cell counts; CRP, C-reactive protein; CT, computed tomography; Dex, dexamethasone (6 mg/m2 per day, 4 days); Pred, prednisone (45 mg/m2 per day, 24 days); MRD,\r\nminimal residual disease; PCP, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; BM, bone marrow; GM, galactomannan antigen test; G test, 1,3-b-D glucan test; PCT,\r\nprocalcitonin; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; mNGS, metagenomic next-generation sequencing; MDT, multidisciplinary team; CTA, computer tomography angiography; PAS, periodic acid\r\nSchiff.\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 05 frontiersin.org\r\nsuch as diabetes. Normal blood glucose levels were monitored, as\r\nwas her nutrition level. During the diagnosis and treatment of\r\nthe patient, blood glucose and urine glucose levels were\r\nmonitored regularly. Strengthening nutritional support is\r\nbeneficial for improving the prognosis.\r\nEarly detection is critical for avoiding the aggressive clinical\r\ncourse and improving prognosis. The diagnosis is based on a\r\ncombination of clinical examinations and histopathologic and\r\nradiological investigations. A biopsy and cultures on standard\r\nmycological media are typically required for a definitive\r\ndiagnosis (26, 27). With the progression of the disease,\r\npersistent fever and respiratory system symptom may occur.\r\nWhile the early symptoms are not typical, they cannot be\r\ndistinguished from other infective causes from other\r\npathogens. Although CT data may be suggestive, they are\r\nfrequently non-specific (27–29). As recommended by the ECIL\r\nguidelines, we also wanted to screen for intracranial infection,\r\nincluding the possibility of endocardial infection. In fact, we\r\nrecommend that cranial imaging be as complete as possible, even\r\nif the patient does not have neurological signs and symptoms.\r\nAdditionally, proper tissue sampling was performed mostly after\r\na delay for the fungal detection. Microscopically, rhizoids are\r\nrarely observed on Lichtheimia strains. Bronchoalveolar lavage\r\nfluid (BAL fluid) and sputum cultures are clinically much\r\nfeasible and safer than tissue biopsy (13, 30). Diagnosis of\r\nmucormycosis is often missed or delayed. In our case, the\r\nparents refused BALF due to risk. It is difficult to detect\r\nLichtheimia ramosa using traditional etiological detection\r\nmethods. Definitive identification requires molecular methods.\r\nmNGS is a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic method. Using\r\nmNGS as soon as possible is recommended when an infection\r\nwith a rare pathogen is suspected, especially in\r\nimmunocompromised individuals who need emergency\r\ntreatment (31, 32). Early clinical trials of patients with\r\nmeningitis or encephalitis, invasive fungal infections,\r\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, and other clinical\r\nindications revealed the potential of direct-from-specimen\r\nmNGS in enabling a difficult infection diagnosis. However, in\r\npublished studies, the proportion of patient cases having a\r\npositive clinical impact as a result of mNGS testing is low, and\r\nthe expense of testing is high, emphasizing the importance of\r\nimproving our understanding of “when to test” and for which\r\npatients mNGS testing is appropriate (33–36). In our case, we\r\nused mNGS for detecting this rare species. It enabled us to\r\neffectively treat this child patient with lung mycosis caused by a\r\nLichtheimia ramosa infection.\r\nAccording to our literature review, the empiric antifungal\r\ntreatment of Lichtheimia ramosa mucormycosis is amphotericin\r\nB and posaconazole. Lichtheimia is usually sensitive to\r\namphotericin B and posaconazole. Amphotericin B is the most\r\nactive drug against Lichtheimia species and is the only antifungal\r\nagent recommended in pediatric mucormycosis (37–39).\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) is a standard of care for a\r\nwide range of medically important opportunistic fungal\r\npathogens. LAmB has a significantly improved toxicity profile\r\ncompared with conventional amphotericin B. However, the\r\nadverse effects and especially nephrotoxicity of amphotericin\r\nB, even with the liposomal formulation, could be problematic.\r\nTABLE 2 Lichtheimia ramosa-related mucormycosis based on available case reports.\r\nDavid Navarro Cateau Suzuki\r\nAge (years) 10 27 8\r\nSex Female Male Male\r\nBaseline diagnosis AML AML AML\r\nRelapse Second relapse No First relapse\r\nChromosomal or genetic abnormalities Data missing 46 XY [23]/47 XY, ?4 [10] No\r\nPersistent febrile neutropenia Yes Yes Yes\r\nAntifungal or anti-mold prophylaxis Yes Yes Yes\r\nPresence of symptoms\r\nFever\r\nCough\r\nOthers\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nDyspnea\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nChills\r\nNo\r\nNo\r\nRight chest pain\r\nBloody sputum\r\nNephritis-like symptoms\r\nType of infection site Pulmonary Skin Pulmonary\r\nCerebral\r\nGM/G test Positive (GM) Data missing Negative (G test)\r\nProven mold infection/specimen BAL fluid necrosis samples culture Sputum culture\r\nTreatment for mycosis Amphotericin B\r\nPosaconazole\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B\r\nposaconazole\r\nLiposomal amphotericin B\r\nStem cell transplantation\r\nSurgery No No No\r\nOutcome Death Death Death\r\nHe et al. 10.3389/fonc.2022.949910\r\nFrontiers in Oncology 06 frontiersin.org\r\nMoreover, amphotericin B liposomes were not available in the\r\nregion of China, so we had to choose conventional amphotericin\r\nB and tried to exclude the intracranial fungal infection. However,\r\nit also has many side effects, which even causes the suspension of\r\nantifungal therapy. According to our experience, it usually\r\ncauses severe vomiting and electrolyte disorder to start with\r\nthe therapeutic dose on day 1, so we tried to increase the dose\r\ngradually. As we hoped, the intolerance of the patient was good.\r\nHer renal function was persistently normal, and she suffered\r\ntransient mild hypokalemia only.\r\nPosaconazole, possibly the recommended oral therapy, can\r\nbe used to complement or substitute amphotericin B therapy (3,\r\n40–42). However, there is no intravenous therapy, and it is not\r\neasy to monitor the blood drug concentration. The effectiveness\r\nof posaconazole is still controversial (43). It has been reported\r\nthat voriconazole has no activity against Lichtheimia ramosa.\r\nIsavuconazole has been approved for adults as first-line therapy\r\nif amphotericin B treatment is not appropriate (21, 44).\r\nIsavuconazole has rarely been reported to be used in children\r\nwith mucormycosis (45). As recommended by the guidelines,\r\nappropriate use of antifungal agents includes dosage, route of\r\nadministration, and monitoring of blood concentration. We do\r\nwant to monitor posaconazole blood concentrations, and we\r\nwant to use an intravenous preparation when amphotericin B is\r\ncombined with posaconazole during the patient’s hospital stay.\r\nHowever, due to the limited conditions, posaconazole\r\nintravenous preparations could not be obtained at that time,\r\nnor could blood drug concentration monitoring TDM be done.\r\nThat is something we need to work on. It is also recommended\r\nthat blood concentrations (effective therapeutic concentration)\r\nbe monitored as much as possible. It has been reported that\r\nechinocandin (micafungin and caspofungin) in combination\r\nwith amphotericin B also has a certain effect (42).\r\nMucormycosis is treated with a combination of antifungal\r\nmedications and surgical debridement of affected tissues.\r\nSurgery has been demonstrated to improve patient survival\r\n(43). Moreover, a combination strategy of intravenous\r\ninhalation and local inhalation and direct airway perfusion of\r\namphotericin B may be an effective strategy for the treatment of\r\npulmonary mucormycosis (46, 47). In our case, intravenous\r\nliposomal amphotericin B was started just after appearance of\r\nsuspicious clinical presentation and radiological findings\r\nsupporting mucormycosis. The patient was then given\r\nposaconazole in conjunction with amphotericin B, as well as\r\nprompt surgical debridement. Lichtheimia ramosa has\r\ncharacteristics comparable to invasive aspergillosis, including\r\nthe potential for angioinvasion and dissemination (1, 48).\r\nExtensive angioinvasion results in tissue necrosis (49).\r\nPulmonary hemorrhage, hemoptysis, asphyxia, and\r\nintracranial infection should be watched out for during\r\ndiagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, the patient had no\r\npulmonary hemorrhage and no abnormal cranial imaging and\r\nCSF findings. If IFD is diagnosed, antifungal treatment should be\r\nstarted immediately, and chemotherapy should be postponed\r\nuntil the IFD is under control, except in rare cases needing\r\nprompt anti-leukemic intervention. During the treatment, renal\r\nwork and electrolyte (low potassium) were closely monitored\r\n(24). In this case, renal function was normal. She had transient\r\nhypokalemia, improved by oral and intravenous potassium\r\nsupplementation and improved diet. In addition, the prompt\r\nrecovery of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is also\r\nnecessary. Fortunately, the child in this case had low-risk ALL\r\nwith sustained CR in BM after experiencing induction remission\r\ntherapy. Since the risk factors for infection in this patient are of\r\nconcern, ALL with Lichtheimia ramosa infection is extremely\r\nrare. The patient received amphotericin B monotherapy for 5\r\nweeks, amphotericin B+ posaconazole for 4 weeks, and then\r\nposaconazole monotherapy. The specific doses are shown in the\r\nattached table. She then had entered the maintain chemotherapy\r\nof the CCCG-ALL-2020 therapy for the low-risk group and stop\r\nusing antifungal drugs. During long-term follow-up, blood\r\nroutine test, CRP test, and CT were taken. The head and chest\r\nCT scans were all normal. The parents and children had good\r\ncompliance and tolerance.\r\nConclusion\r\nHere, we report a rare case of an infrequent fungal mycosis\r\nassociated with the causal species (Lichtheimia ramosa) in a\r\nchild ALL and review Lichtheimia ramosa-related mycosis based\r\non published case reports. This report summarizes the difficulty\r\nof making an early diagnosis and the importance of considering\r\nmucormycosis in subjects developing fever unresponsive to\r\nother antimicrobials and have breathing difficulty. The timing\r\nof proper medical therapy with antifungal medications and early\r\nsurgical resection is critical. mNGS is more effective when used\r\nearly in the diagnostic process.\r\nData availability satement\r\nThe original contributions presented in the study are\r\nincluded in the article/supplementary material.
