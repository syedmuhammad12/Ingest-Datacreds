However,\nit can also occur in patients with malignant diseases, especially when they have been under treatment with chemotherapy,\nimmunosuppressive agents, or corticosteroids.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, cavitary pneumonia, and stage Ib invasive\nintraductal carcinoma of the left breast. She had completed four cycles of dose-dense chemotherapy (DDC) with doxorubicin\nand cyclophosphamide (AC) five months prior to admission, followed by paclitaxel and dexamethasone 10 mg\n(approximately 70 mg of prednisone) weekly for 9 weeks. She presented to the hospital after she was found hypoxic prior to\nchemotherapy infusion. On further questioning, she complained of exertional dyspnea, productive cough, and fatigue for\nseveral weeks. On exam, she was tachycardic (HR 105 bpm), hypoxic SpO2 81% on room air, and bibasilar inspiratory\ncrackles noted on lung exam. workup was remarkable for hemoglobin 11.0g/dL, D-dimer 494.0 ng/mL, and elevated\ntransaminases. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism, new diffuse\nbilateral ground-glass opacities, and improved right upper lobe cavitary mass compared to CTA from three months ago.\nCeftriaxone and azithromycin were started for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Due to her symptoms and\nimage findings, she underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to test for atypical microorganisms.\nFurther workup showed elevated LDH 352 UI/L, elevated serum $-D-Glucan 388 pg/mL, positive P. jirovecii PCR from BAL,\nand no acid-fast bacilli on smear. She was started on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) with the improvement of\nsymptoms, in addition to tapering doses of steroids due to the degree of hypoxia. She was eventually discharged home to\ncomplete a 21-day course of TMP/SMX and a steroid taper. PJP prophylaxis was recommended if she were to need further\nchemotherapy.\n\nDISCUSSION: Patients with PJP and malignant diseases have a shorter duration, more severe hypoxia, and poorer\nprognosis. Only a few cases of PJP during DDC have been reported. While AC regimen is associated with lymphocyte\ndepletion, Paclitaxel has not been associated with such side effects. Daily corticosteroids have been used in the prevention\nand treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, which has increased the risk for PJP. A recent study has\nshown that intermittent corticosteroids as part of chemotherapy regimen could be a risk factor for developing PCP.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: PJP is a rare but potentially fatal complication of early breast cancer (EBC) treatment. PJP should be suspected\nin patients with EBC on DDC and intermittent doses of steroids. Further studies are needed to clarify whether providing PJP\nprophylaxis and reducing the dose of intermittent steroids helps reduce the risks of PJP.\n\nReference #1: Sepkowitz KA.
