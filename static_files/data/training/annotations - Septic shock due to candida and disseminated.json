We report a case of patient who underwent elective spinal surgery and developed invasive herpes as well as\ncandidiasis postoperatively without any direct evidence of immunosuppression.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHerpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) affects 3.7 billion people\nunder the age of 50 (67% of global population) worldwide. HSV1 is typically transmitted by oral but can also\nbe transmitted through genital contact. Although often\nasymptomatic, HSV1 can cause painful ulcers ranging\nin severity [1]. Medications can reduce severity and frequency of symptoms; however, there is no known cure.\nSevere manifestations of HSV1 include encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and esophagitis [2]. Once infected,\nHSV1 is a lifelong infection with the potential for recurrence. Immunocompromised hosts may experience more\nfrequent and severe symptoms due to a of lack cellular\nimmunity.\n\nCASE REPORT\nA 67-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the\nintensive care unit (ICU) following elective posterior\nspinal instrumentation and fusion with laminectomy\ndue to concerns for postoperative respiratory distress.\nMedical history of the patient included chronic back\npain, obesity, hypertension, gastritis, HSV1 and tobacco\nuse. Prior to surgery, the patient completed six courses of\nprednisone, 50 mg daily for 5 days over a 3-month period\nfor chronic back pain.\nPostoperative day (POD) 1, she desaturated to SpO2\nof 85%. Oxygenation improved with continuous positive\n\nairway pressure. Chest X-ray was notable for bilateral\nlower lobe infiltrates. On the day of surgery, a glucocorticoid taper with dexamethasone and hydrocortisone\nwas initiated. In addition, the patient received a one time\ndose of hydrocortisone of 100 mg. The patient received\ndexamethasone 10 mg twice daily for 1 day, 8 mg twice\ndaily for 1 day and 6 mg once during POD 1–2. On POD\n3, the patient was transitioned to hydrocortisone 50 mg\nevery 6 h for 1 day, followed by hydrocortisone 25 mg\nevery 6 h for 1 day.\nOn POD 2, the patient developed acute kidney injury.\nBlood cultures were ordered due to febrile episodes and\nvancomycin and piperacillin–tazobactam were initiated.\nOn POD 5, she became hemodynamically unstable with\nhypercapnic respiratory failure. She was intubated and\nstarted on norepinephrine and hemodialysis. On POD 6,\nthe white blood cell count doubled and procalcitonin was\nelevated. Repeat cultures were sent and antimicrobials\nwere broadened to vancomycin and meropenem. Chest\nX-ray was concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Blood, urine and sputum cultures grew\nCandida albicans. Fluconazole was initiated.\nDue to concerns for immunosuppression in the setting\nof glucocorticoid use and candedemia, additional testing was ordered. A β-D-Glucan was not performed as\npatient’s serum triglycerides were > 700 mg/dL. Sputum\nwas negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii. Immunostaining\n\nReceived: April 28, 2022.

Gastric body.\n\nshowed many nuclear and cytoplasmic cells that were\npositive for HSV. Disseminated HSV1 infection was confirmed with DNA PCR. Acyclovir was initiated. Family\nreported that she had history of oral HSV1 and experienced recurrent oral infections.\nOn POD 15, the patient was noted to have bloody\noutput from the orogastric tube and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed. Diffuse esophageal\nand gastric ulcerations were noted, consistent with\nHSV esophagitis (Figs 1 and 2). The patient began\nimproving clinically. Vasopressors were discontinued and\npatient was extubated the following morning. She was\ntransferred out of the ICU on POD 28 with improvement\nof renal function and discontinuation of dialysis. Patient\nwas discharged on POD 39.\n\nDISCUSSION\nC. albicans has been described as an opportunistic infection occurring in immunocompromised hosts. Mortality\nis reported to be as high as 40% with disseminated\ncandidiasis in immunocompromised individuals. Risk\nfactors for disseminated candidiasis include malignancy,\nimmunosuppressive factors such as corticosteroids, diabetes, infection and poor lifestyle habits such as chronic\ntobacco, alcohol and drug abuse [3]. As mentioned, our\npatient had completed multiple courses of prednisone\ntherapy over the 3-month period preceding her elective surgery and received additional glucocorticoids\npostoperatively. Although our patient fully recovered\nafter the initiation of appropriate therapy, this is a\n\nstark comparison to recent studies showing up to an\n85.9% mortality in immunocompromised patients with\nseptic shock due to invasive Candida spp. infections with\nprolonged ICU stay [4].\nHSV1 infections usually cause ulcerated lesions. HSV\nviremia has been reported in up to 25% of immunocompetent patients with primary HSV infections [5].\nOverall, the incidence of HSV1 reactivation in critically\nill patients with septic shock ranges from 32 to 68%\n[6]. HSV1 esophagitis is a well-known complication as\nthe esophagus is the most commonly involved visceral\norgan. HSV esophagitis is usually found in patients with\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancies,\nthose receiving immunosuppressive therapy or terminally ill [7]. There is no clearly defining link between\npreoperative hydrocortisone use over a short period of\ntime and significant immunosuppression. Currently,\nthere is no consensus on the risk of reactivation of\ncutaneous HSV1 progressing into disseminated viremia.\nThe possible reasons for our patient include immunosuppression, spinal surgery in an obese patient, the\ndevelopment of ARDS or the preceding fungemia. ACSNSQIP data from 2011 to 2014 identified that 3.7%\nof patients who underwent elective posterior lumbar\nfusion were on chronic glucocorticoids [8]. As previously\nmentioned, 67% of global population is estimated to\nbe affected by HSV. This case demonstrates that the\npossibility of disseminated viral infection must be\nconsidered even after elective spinal cases.\n\nCONCLUSION\nHSV1 can present with severe symptoms in immunocompromised patients. These manifestations can stem\nfrom a variety of etiologies including patient risk factors, clinical condition, recent surgery and concomitant\ninfection. This is one of the first descriptions in literature\ndescribing a patient undergoing elective spinal surgery\nwhose postoperative course was complicated by disseminated HSV and invasive candedemia. In our patient,\nwe believe that the viral and fungal sepsis stemmed\nfrom a combination of obesity, surgery, preceding infections, and glucocorticoid and tobacco use. Despite the\noverwhelming evidence of mortality in these patients,\nour patient responded to treatment. Thorough histories\nshould be elicited from high-risk patients undergoing\nelective procedures prior to operation to address all possible complications. All patients should also undergo\nproper education including discussion of peri-operative\nand post-operative risks.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. “Herpes Simplex Virus.” World Health Organization, World Health\nOrganization,\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/\ndetail/herpes-simplex-virus (15 April 2022, date last accessed).\n2.
