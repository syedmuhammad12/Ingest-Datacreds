Her BP was well controlled \r\nwhich also excluded hypertensive choroidopathy as a \r\ncause. Posterior scleritis was unlikely since she reported \r\nno eye pain. She did not experience any prodromal/\r\nauditory symptoms and had no other integumentary \r\nsigns that might be suggestive of Vogt‑Koyanagi‑Harada \r\nsyndrome. Iatrogenic causes were excluded as there was \r\nno history of ocular procedures such as cryotherapy or \r\nphotocoagulation. Primary and secondary choroidal \r\ntumors were excluded as there were no obvious lesions \r\nclinically. The diagnosis was made by a simple blood \r\ncount and further workup eliminated infections as \r\na cause. The shallow nature of the detachments and \r\nthe location being confined to the posterior pole were \r\ngenerally what was reported in association with \r\nleukemia.[3] The yellowish deep subretinal discoloration \r\nindicates deep diffuse infiltrates and aggregates of \r\nleukemic cells. Despite the evidence of CNS disease on \r\nCSF analysis, there was no invasion of the optic nerve or \r\nsymptoms suggestive of CNS involvement.\r\nThis is the first case reported with the subtype MPAL \r\npresenting with serous macular detachments. In \r\ncontrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in \r\nwhich there is a proliferation of immature B or T \r\ncells, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) which \r\nconsists of immature myeloid lineage cells, MPAL fails \r\nto show commitment to the myeloid, B lymphoid, or T \r\nlymphoid lineages. Therefore, it falls under the umbrella \r\nof acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage. MPALs \r\ncan further be subclassified as either biphenotypic or \r\nbilineal. The former comprises a single blast population \r\nexpressing antigens of more than one lineage and the \r\nlatter comprises two distinct populations of blasts. The \r\nexpression of specific antigens helps further assign the \r\nsubtype of MPAL [Table 1].[4] Our patient expressed \r\nmyeloperoxidase, as well as CD19 and CD79A which \r\nlabels her as MPAL and B/myeloid.\r\nA systematic review on SRD as a leukemic choroidopathy \r\nreported its association with other subtypes such as \r\nALL (41.9%), AML (23.3%), relapsed ALL (27.9%), and \r\nrelapsed AML (6.9%). Half of them occurred between \r\nages 17 and 45 years without any sex predominance. Like \r\nour case, most had bilateral involvement and the majority \r\nwere observed before the diagnosis of acute leukemia.[2]\r\nThe mechanism underlying SRDs associated with \r\nleukemia is less well understood. The choroidal \r\ninvolvement results in secondary alterations of the \r\noverlying RPE in the form of serous detachment. \r\nProposed mechanisms include abnormal choroidal \r\nperfusion and/or damage to the outer blood–retinal \r\nbarrier along with neoplastic choroidal infiltration, \r\nlocalized choroidal hypoxia, or alterations to local oncotic \r\nand/or hydrostatic forces.[5] Yabas Kiziloglu et al.[6]\r\npostulated that choroidal infiltration by leukemic cells \r\nleads to a decrease in blood flow at the choriocapillaris \r\nwith subsequent ischemia. This disrupts the RPE tight \r\nintercellular junctions which thereby lead to serous \r\ndetachment of the neurosensory retina or RPE necrosis.\r\nThe resolution of SRD after systemic chemotherapy \r\nconfirmed the infiltration of choroid by leukemic \r\ncells in the SRD area. In contrast to previous reports \r\nshowing that visual function can be fully restored \r\nafter appropriate therapy, visual recovery in our case \r\nwas not as expected. An electroretinogram (ERG) and \r\nvisual evoked potential (VEP) were carried out. The \r\nfull field ERG showed a nonspecific, moderate rod–\r\ncone dysfunction, whereas the multifocal ERG was \r\nconsistent with central maculopathy OD and paracentral \r\nmaculopathy OS. The VEP showed no evidence of optic \r\nTable  1: The World health organization classification\r\nof acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage revised 4th\r\nedition\r\nALAL\r\nAUL\r\nMPAL\r\nMyeloid lineage: MPO or monocytic differentiation (at least two of \r\nthe following: nonspecific esterase cytochemistry, CD11c, CD14, \r\nCD64, and lysozyme)\r\nT‑lineage: Strong cytoplasmic CD3 (with antibodies to CD3 e \r\nchain) or surface CD3\r\nB‑lineage: Strong CD19 with at least one of the following strongly \r\nexpressed: CD79a, cytoplasmic CD22, or CD10 or weak CD19 \r\nwith at least two of the following strongly expressed: CD79a, \r\ncytoplasmic CD22, or CD10\r\nALAL: Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, AUL: Acute undifferentiated \r\nleukemia, MPAL: Mixed‑phenotype acute leukemia, MPO: Myeloperoxidase\r\nFigure 5: Fundus autofluorescence showing hyperautofluorescent spots in a \r\nleopard spot pattern.

The appearance of retinal pigment \r\nof retinal pigment epitheliopathy in the form of leopard \r\nspot pattern is a rare entity and has been mainly reported \r\nin reported in association with leukemia recurrence in \r\nchildren, chronic leukemia, and cases of acute leukemia \r\nundergoing chemotherapy. It is thought to be due to \r\nthe invasion of the choriocapillaris by leukemia cells \r\nresulting in ischemia and dysfunction of the retinal \r\npigment epithelium. Additional factors such as drug \r\ntoxicity have been postulated.[7,8] This could likely \r\nexplain the permanent damage to the RPE as a sequela \r\nof malignancy or toxicity from chemotherapy. The slight \r\ndelay in presentation could have also contributed to this \r\nsequela.\r\nThis case report highlights that a new diagnosis of SRD \r\nwithout an obvious cause should raise suspicion of \r\nmasquerade syndromes like leukemias. The earlier the \r\ndiagnosis is suspected, the more likely the patient will \r\nreceive timely treatment and be able to restore vision. \r\nA visit to the ophthalmologist may be the patient’s first \r\nencounter in diagnosing such serious, life‑threatening \r\nconditions.\r\nDeclaration of patient consent\r\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate \r\npatient consent forms.

OS showed \r\na large bacillary layer detachment and a small serous \r\ndetachment [Figure 2b].\r\nLaboratory data showed abnormal complete blood count \r\nconsisting of a low hemoglobin level (8.7 g/dL) and \r\nan alarmingly elevated white cell count (62.8 × 109\r\n/L). \r\nThere was an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate \r\nlevel (143 mm/hr). Infectious workup for tuberculosis, \r\nsyphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes \r\nsimplex virus were all negative. A chest X‑ray was \r\nreported normal. The patient’s blood film showed a \r\nleukoerythroblastic picture with circulating blasts of \r\nmore than 85% of the total white cells. The patient was \r\nimmediately referred to hemato‑oncology for further \r\nworkup. A bone marrow biopsy and cerebrospinal \r\nfluid (CSF) analysis revealed morphologic evidence \r\nof lymphoblasts. A brain magnetic resonance imaging \r\nwith contrast showed dural enhancement suggestive of \r\ninfiltration and leptomeningeal dissemination without \r\ncompressive masses along the optic nerves. Following \r\na complete morphological, immunophenotypic, and \r\ncytogenetic analysis, she was diagnosed with MPAL, \r\nPhiladelphia chromosome‑positive, with the central \r\nnervous system (CNS) disease stage three.\r\nInduction chemotherapy was started with dasatinib, \r\nvincristine, dexamethasone, and triple intrathecal \r\ninjections of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone. \r\nA month later, the patient showed complete resolution \r\nof serous detachments with minimal residual subretinal \r\nfluid [Figure 3a and b]. With clinical resolution, there \r\nwas an improvement in the hyperopic shift but limited \r\nimprovement in visual acuity with BCVA OD/OS of \r\n0.2 (with + 3.50 D) and 0.25 (with + 2.00 D), respectively. \r\nPosttreatment fundus examination [Figure 4a and b] \r\nand autofluorescence [Figure 5a and b] revealed retinal \r\npigment epithelial (RPE) mottling in a “leopard spot” \r\npattern.\r\nDiscussion\r\nOur patient’s unusual presentation with bilateral serous \r\nmacular detachments in the context of her demographics, \r\nFigure 1: (a) Fundus photography of the right eye showing a serous retinal \r\ndetachment involving the macula.

Her BP was well controlled \r\nwhich also excluded hypertensive choroidopathy as a \r\ncause. Posterior scleritis was unlikely since she reported \r\nno eye pain. She did not experience any prodromal/\r\nauditory symptoms and had no other integumentary \r\nsigns that might be suggestive of Vogt‑Koyanagi‑Harada \r\nsyndrome. Iatrogenic causes were excluded as there was \r\nno history of ocular procedures such as cryotherapy or \r\nphotocoagulation. Primary and secondary choroidal \r\ntumors were excluded as there were no obvious lesions \r\nclinically. The diagnosis was made by a simple blood \r\ncount and further workup eliminated infections as \r\na cause. The shallow nature of the detachments and \r\nthe location being confined to the posterior pole were \r\ngenerally what was reported in association with \r\nleukemia.[3] The yellowish deep subretinal discoloration \r\nindicates deep diffuse infiltrates and aggregates of \r\nleukemic cells. Despite the evidence of CNS disease on \r\nCSF analysis, there was no invasion of the optic nerve or \r\nsymptoms suggestive of CNS involvement.\r\nThis is the first case reported with the subtype MPAL \r\npresenting with serous macular detachments. In \r\ncontrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in \r\nwhich there is a proliferation of immature B or T \r\ncells, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) which \r\nconsists of immature myeloid lineage cells, MPAL fails \r\nto show commitment to the myeloid, B lymphoid, or T \r\nlymphoid lineages. Therefore, it falls under the umbrella \r\nof acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage. MPALs \r\ncan further be subclassified as either biphenotypic or \r\nbilineal. The former comprises a single blast population \r\nexpressing antigens of more than one lineage and the \r\nlatter comprises two distinct populations of blasts. The \r\nexpression of specific antigens helps further assign the \r\nsubtype of MPAL [Table 1].[4] Our patient expressed \r\nmyeloperoxidase, as well as CD19 and CD79A which \r\nlabels her as MPAL and B/myeloid.\r\nA systematic review on SRD as a leukemic choroidopathy \r\nreported its association with other subtypes such as \r\nALL (41.9%), AML (23.3%), relapsed ALL (27.9%), and \r\nrelapsed AML (6.9%). Half of them occurred between \r\nages 17 and 45 years without any sex predominance. Like \r\nour case, most had bilateral involvement and the majority \r\nwere observed before the diagnosis of acute leukemia.[2]\r\nThe mechanism underlying SRDs associated with \r\nleukemia is less well understood. The choroidal \r\ninvolvement results in secondary alterations of the \r\noverlying RPE in the form of serous detachment. \r\nProposed mechanisms include abnormal choroidal \r\nperfusion and/or damage to the outer blood–retinal \r\nbarrier along with neoplastic choroidal infiltration, \r\nlocalized choroidal hypoxia, or alterations to local oncotic \r\nand/or hydrostatic forces.[5] Yabas Kiziloglu et al.[6]\r\npostulated that choroidal infiltration by leukemic cells \r\nleads to a decrease in blood flow at the choriocapillaris \r\nwith subsequent ischemia. This disrupts the RPE tight \r\nintercellular junctions which thereby lead to serous \r\ndetachment of the neurosensory retina or RPE necrosis.\r\nThe resolution of SRD after systemic chemotherapy \r\nconfirmed the infiltration of choroid by leukemic \r\ncells in the SRD area. In contrast to previous reports \r\nshowing that visual function can be fully restored \r\nafter appropriate therapy, visual recovery in our case \r\nwas not as expected. An electroretinogram (ERG) and \r\nvisual evoked potential (VEP) were carried out. The \r\nfull field ERG showed a nonspecific, moderate rod–\r\ncone dysfunction, whereas the multifocal ERG was \r\nconsistent with central maculopathy OD and paracentral \r\nmaculopathy OS. The VEP showed no evidence of optic \r\nTable  1: The World health organization classification\r\nof acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage revised 4th\r\nedition\r\nALAL\r\nAUL\r\nMPAL\r\nMyeloid lineage: MPO or monocytic differentiation (at least two of \r\nthe following: nonspecific esterase cytochemistry, CD11c, CD14, \r\nCD64, and lysozyme)\r\nT‑lineage: Strong cytoplasmic CD3 (with antibodies to CD3 e \r\nchain) or surface CD3\r\nB‑lineage: Strong CD19 with at least one of the following strongly \r\nexpressed: CD79a, cytoplasmic CD22, or CD10 or weak CD19 \r\nwith at least two of the following strongly expressed: CD79a, \r\ncytoplasmic CD22, or CD10\r\nALAL: Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage, AUL: Acute undifferentiated \r\nleukemia, MPAL: Mixed‑phenotype acute leukemia, MPO: Myeloperoxidase\r\nFigure 5: Fundus autofluorescence showing hyperautofluorescent spots in a \r\nleopard spot pattern.

The appearance of retinal pigment \r\nof retinal pigment epitheliopathy in the form of leopard \r\nspot pattern is a rare entity and has been mainly reported \r\nin reported in association with leukemia recurrence in \r\nchildren, chronic leukemia, and cases of acute leukemia \r\nundergoing chemotherapy. It is thought to be due to \r\nthe invasion of the choriocapillaris by leukemia cells \r\nresulting in ischemia and dysfunction of the retinal \r\npigment epithelium. Additional factors such as drug \r\ntoxicity have been postulated.[7,8] This could likely \r\nexplain the permanent damage to the RPE as a sequela \r\nof malignancy or toxicity from chemotherapy. The slight \r\ndelay in presentation could have also contributed to this \r\nsequela.\r\nThis case report highlights that a new diagnosis of SRD \r\nwithout an obvious cause should raise suspicion of \r\nmasquerade syndromes like leukemias. The earlier the \r\ndiagnosis is suspected, the more likely the patient will \r\nreceive timely treatment and be able to restore vision. \r\nA visit to the ophthalmologist may be the patient’s first \r\nencounter in diagnosing such serious, life‑threatening \r\nconditions.\r\nDeclaration of patient consent\r\nThe authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate \r\npatient consent forms.
