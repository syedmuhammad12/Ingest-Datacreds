We report the successful\r\nuse of dexmedetomidine in a 63-year old female with recurrent breast cancer and intractable\r\nleft arm pain and swelling admitted to University of California, San Diego, Health (UC San\r\nDiego Health), palliative care unit. Patient’s pain and agitation continued to persist and she\r\ndeclined clinically despite efforts to start methadone, continuous infusion opioids, continuous\r\ninfusion lidocaine and intravenous chlorpromazine by the palliative care team. On hospital\r\nday (HD) 11 patient was started on dexmedetomidine continuous infusion for refractory\r\npain per our protocol at UC San Diego Health. The next day the patient appeared much\r\nimproved in terms of pain and agitation with grimacing and moaning completely resolved.\r\nShe was able to have some lucid periods and interacting with her family. With the addition\r\nof dexmedetomidine to her pain regiment, the patient was able to peacefully die 5 days\r\nlater. This case report highlights the clinical utility of demedetomidine in a palliative care\r\nunit for refractory pain at EoL.\r\n\r\nRabia S Atayee, University of California San Diego Palliative Care Program, Pharmacy, San Diego, CA, US\r\nByrne JM, Mesarwi P, Edmonds KP, Atayee RS.

Though much of\r\nthe pain seen by specialist palliative care teams\r\nis complex, opioids often represent a first-step\r\nanalgesic (2). Beyond opioids, palliative care teams\r\nuse a variety of co-analgesic medications to target\r\npain based on the etiology of the pain and the\r\nindividual patient experience (3).\r\nThe concept of total pain, suffering that\r\nencompasses physical, existential and psychosocial\r\npain, has been well described in the palliative\r\ncare literature (4). The presence of anxiety and\r\nother existential suffering in the setting of progressive\r\nmetastatic cancer can impact a patient’s\r\nexperience of their pain (5) and complicate its\r\nsuccessful palliation (1).\r\nPresented with the problem of increasing pain\r\nwith limited opioid-responsiveness, the escalation\r\nof opioid analgesics for severe pain often causes\r\nunwanted effects including, nausea and vomiting,\r\nsedation, delirium, respiratory depression, pruritus,\r\nand constipation (6). When escalating doses of opioids\r\ndo not lead to improved pain control,\r\nco-analgesics will often be added. As an example,\r\nin people with cancer-related pain and\r\nmorphine-equivalents daily doses (MEDD)>60-80mg,\r\n36-40% had adjuvant non-opioid analgesics added\r\nto their medication regimens in one study (3).\r\nAdjuvant analgesics are selected based on the pathophysiology\r\nof the refractory cancer-related pain.\r\nUnfortunately, the ability to tolerate oral medications\r\ndeclines at the end-of-life, thereby limiting\r\nanalgesic medication options.

M. BYRNE ET AL.\r\nmedications such as gabapentinoids or tricyclic\r\nanti-depressants are no longer feasible in this\r\nsetting, and management of neuropathic pain\r\noften requires parenteral analgesics such as ketamine,\r\nmethadone and/or lidocaine (7). The\r\nchoice of non-opioid co-analgesics is also\r\ninformed by patient prognosis, as medications\r\nrequire time to reach peak effect and steady state\r\nconcentrations. As an example, although methadone\r\nis useful in complex pain syndromes due\r\nto its unique mechanisms of action (8,9) it takes\r\nseveral days to reach steady state and may therefore\r\nbe less helpful if the patient has a shorter\r\nprognosis.\r\nThe addition of non-opioid co-analgesics comes\r\nwith potential pitfalls, especially when added to\r\na baseline of opioid side effects. This is especially\r\ntrue when using anti-convulsant medications such\r\nas gabapentinoids. Intravenous ketamine carries\r\nthe risk of hallucinations and delirium as\r\nunwanted effects (10,11). This is also true of\r\nco-analgesic steroids. Intravenous lidocaine, a\r\nsodium channel blocker, carries cardiac risks that\r\nmust be considered (12). For those with evidence\r\nof muscle spasm, tizanidine, baclofen, and benzodiazepines\r\nare often used though these also\r\ncarry risks of confusion, delirium, or hallucinations\r\n(7).\r\nDexmedetomidine, a selective alpha-2 agonist,\r\nis an attractive option for opioid-refractory and\r\ncomplex pain for many reasons (13). It is frequently\r\nused in the intensive care setting for\r\nsedation and anxiolysis with mechanically ventilated\r\npatients, which theoretically allows arousable\r\nsedation (14). It has concurrent analgesic\r\nand anxiolytic properties in addition to mild\r\nsedation side effects, allowing for wakeful\r\nmoments. It is widely used in the perioperative\r\nsetting as an opioid-sparing agent to lessen the\r\nrisk of opioid induced respiratory depression (15).\r\nWith a favorable pharmacokinetic profile of quick\r\nonset and short half-life, dexmedetomidine infusions\r\nalso reach steady state in a short time.\r\nThe use of dexmedetomidine for the control\r\nof pain and agitation at the end of life has been\r\ndescribed by Burns et al. (16). In their study,\r\ndexmedetomidine was administered in the pediatric\r\npopulation and delivered outside of the ICU\r\nsetting without incident. They report that the\r\naddition of dexmedetomidine resulted in a trend\r\nof less opioid escalation thereby avoiding possible\r\nopioid induced hyperalgesia. There are a few case\r\nstudies in the use of dexmedetomidine in a palliative\r\ncare population (17). Ferguson et al discuss\r\nthe use of intranasal dexmedetomidine for pain\r\nand anxiety in association with painful, lengthy\r\ndressing changes in an outpatient setting (18).\r\nSeymour and colleagues have most recently discussed\r\na dosing guideline for dexmedetomidine\r\n(17). Dexmedetomidine was also explored for\r\nintractable cancer related pain in the setting of\r\nEoL care (19). Dexmedetomidine’s use for intractable\r\npain and opioid hyperalgesia, with the addition\r\nof assessing its appropriateness in the setting\r\nof delirium at EoL, are presented in an additional\r\ncase study (20). The use of dexmedetomidine for\r\nmanagement of delirium at EoL have also been\r\ndescribed (21).\r\nThe use of dexmedetomidine outside of the\r\nICU, in palliative care unit has been described\r\npreviously in a case report by Roberts and colleagues\r\n(22). We hope that this case report will\r\nadd to the literature the successful employment\r\nof a new dexmedetomidine guideline for pain in\r\nthe treatment of complex cancer-related pain at\r\nend of life in the palliative care unit of a large,\r\ntwo-hospital academic medical center.\r\nCase presentation\r\nA 63-year-old female with recurrent, triple negative\r\ninvasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast\r\npresented to UC San Diego Health with intractable\r\nleft arm pain and swelling. She was initially\r\ndiagnosed with stage III-C disease 19 months\r\nprior to this presentation and received neoadjuvant\r\nchemotherapy followed by lumpectomy and\r\nlymph node dissection. Months later, she developed\r\nrecurrent disease including a large left\r\nbreast mass extending into the chest wall and a\r\nleft axillary nodal mass extending into the pectoralis\r\nmuscle. After 5 cycles of carboplatin and\r\ngemcitabine, she was seen in her oncologist’s\r\noffice and presumed to have disease progression\r\nbased on exam findings and declining functional\r\nstatus (newly bed and wheelchair bound). Second\r\nline therapy was discussed, and she was referred\r\nfor repeat CT scans to confirm the extent of\r\nJOURNAL OF PAIN & PALLIATIVE CARE PHARMACOTHERAPY 3\r\nprogression prior to initiating therapy.\r\nUnfortunately, she could not tolerate imaging\r\nstudies due to severe anxiety, claustrophobia, and\r\nnow-intractable pain in her left arm and chest.\r\nHer outpatient palliative and oncology teams\r\nreferred her to the emergency department for\r\nsevere pain and arm swelling. Her prescribed\r\nhome analgesia regimen at the time of this presentation\r\nconsisted of methadone 5 mg every\r\n8 hours (taking BID), gabapentin 300 mg three\r\ntimes daily, and oxycodone 10-20mg every 4 hours\r\nas needed (using 5 times daily on average). Upon\r\nadmission, she was continued on her home regimen\r\nwith the addition of hydromorphone 1 mg\r\nIV q 4 hours prn “rescue bolus” dose. Her MEDD\r\non this regimen as calculated using our institutional\r\nguideline (23) was 135 mg + 15 mg methadone\r\n(23). From this time on, methadone was\r\nnot titrated and will not be included in the MEDD.\r\nAn interdisciplinary palliative care team evaluated\r\nthe patient on HD 2 and noted severe\r\naching and burning pain in her left chest wall\r\nand arm. Her exam showed hard, nodular tissue\r\nfrom her left breast to shoulder to upper arm.\r\nPsychosocial history was remarkable for many\r\nyears of generalized anxiety and panic for which\r\nshe never sought medical care. More recently, she\r\nexperienced panic with each imaging study and\r\nhad pervasive worries about her future and overall\r\nprognosis, with anxious ruminations leading\r\nto insomnia. She had not shared these worries\r\nwith her medical team and had never been prescribed\r\nmedication for anxiety or insomnia apart\r\nfrom lorazepam 0.5 mg PO as needed before\r\nimaging studies. On this admission, lorazepam\r\n0.5 mg PO q 6 hours as needed for anxiety had\r\nbeen started and was continued for the first\r\n7 days of her admission (with minimal use).\r\nGiven her severe pain, a hydromorphone PCA\r\n(demand dose of 0.5 mg, 10 min lockout) was\r\ninitiated in hopes of rapid opioid dose-finding\r\nand improved analgesia. Methadone was continued\r\nboth for neuropathic co-analgesic benefits\r\nand as a basal opioid. Gabapentin and oxycodone\r\nwere discontinued to minimize polypharmacy.\r\nDespite initial concerns that her anxiety might\r\nlead to inappropriate PCA utilization, her MEDD\r\non HD3 was only modestly increased to 230 mg.\r\nShe continued to report severe distress and\r\nfeeling that “the button isn’t working.” A rescue\r\ndose of hydromorphone 1 mg IV q 4 hours prn\r\nsevere pain was added in addition to starting a\r\ntrial of dexamethasone 10 mg IV daily. Steroids\r\nwere chosen as a next step in hopes that targeting\r\nthe inflammatory nature of her tumor would\r\nimprove pain. Trazodone 25 mg qhs with an additional\r\n25 mg available prn and Lexapro 5 mg daily\r\nwere also added for sleep and anxiety, respectively.\r\nThe next day, her MEDD had increased to\r\n390 mg and the patient was noted to be “gripping\r\nher PCA button” with report of ongoing severe\r\npain and anxiety. At this time, opioids were not\r\ntitrated further given our assessment that previous\r\nincreases had not improved her pain control\r\n(24). Between HD4 and 8, her pain continued\r\nunchanged. PCA settings were unchanged because\r\nof the aforementioned concerns and MEDD stabilized\r\nin the 200 mg range. Trazodone was\r\ntitrated up in a stepwise manner to 150 mg qhs\r\nfor insomnia driven by anxiety. On HD 6, the\r\npatient developed delirium characterized by visual\r\nhallucinations of bottles flying in her room.\r\nDexamethasone was stopped at that time given\r\nconcerns that this medication was primarily driving\r\nher hallucinations. Ativan prn was also\r\nstopped despite minimal use given concern that\r\ndoses given would worsen delirium. Risperidone\r\nwas added at 0.5 mg q 4 hours as needed for anxiety,\r\npanic and distressing hallucinations.\r\nOver this time, the inpatient palliative care\r\nteam held discussions with Interventional\r\nRadiology (IR) regarding possible procedures for\r\nanalgesia. This was felt to be an ideal next option\r\ngiven the localized nature of the pain and side\r\neffects complicating titration of pharmacotherapies.\r\nIR recommended staged procedures with\r\nleft intercostal neurolysis followed by left stellate\r\nganglion block. She underwent T2-T5 intercostal\r\nneurolysis late on HD8, with delay resulting from\r\nthe need to schedule anesthesia to allow positioning\r\nfor imaging and the procedure itself.\r\nThe morning after intercostal neurolysis, the\r\npatient reported no appreciable change in her\r\npain. Imaging done in preparation for the IR\r\nprocedure showed dramatic enlargement of\r\nknown masses as well as new spread through the\r\ndermal lymphatics and bilateral pleural effusions.\r\nThis news was shared with the patient and her\r\n4 J. M. BYRNE ET AL.\r\ndaughter. Following this conversation, the patient\r\nbecame highly distressed–crying out “I need\r\nhelp,” appearing highly anxious, and reporting\r\ngeneralized pain. An infusion of intravenous lidocaine\r\nwas started to target reported burning,\r\nneuropathic pain (with bolus of 1.5 mg/kg followed\r\nby 1 mg/kg/hr using ideal body weight)\r\n(12). Lidocaine was chosen over other possible\r\noptions (restarting gabapentin, intravenous ketamine\r\ninfusion, and duloxetine) given the acuity\r\nof her pain, desire for a drug with quick onset,\r\nand concern about the risk of exacerbating delirium\r\nwith other options. Hydromorphone PCA\r\nwas continued (demand dose of 0.5 mg, 10 min\r\nlockout). The previously mentioned hydromorphone\r\n1 mg IV q 4 hour prn dose for severe pain\r\nwas also continued.\r\nA family meeting occurred on HD10 when the\r\npatient’s oncologist and children were able to\r\nmeet in person. This meeting resulted in the\r\npatient transitioning to comfort care. Decision\r\nwas made not to proceed with the planned stellate\r\nganglion block given the family’s concern\r\nabout the discomfort of positioning for this procedure.\r\nHowever, the patient remained mildly\r\ndelirious and in ongoing severe pain, her family\r\nremained strongly hopeful that she might experience\r\npain relief while still having lucid moments\r\nto say goodbyes. Therefore, lidocaine was titrated\r\nup to 1.5 mg/kg/hr (as this titration was felt to\r\nhave potential to improve her pain with low risk\r\nof worsening delirium). Chlorpromazine 25 mg\r\nIV infused over 30 minutes was added at bedtime\r\nonly in hopes of helping with sleep and delirium\r\nwhile not causing daytime somnolence.\r\nChlorpromazine is advised to be administered\r\nvia a slow infusion rate not to exceed 1 mg/minute\r\nin adults to avoid any hypotension (25).\r\nThough the patient did sleep 5 hours after\r\nchlorpromazine was given, her reported pain did\r\nnot improve after the changes of the previous day\r\nand delirium now markedly worsened by HD11.\r\nShe was now unable to provide meaningful\r\nanswers to any complex questions, reported alarming\r\nvisions of her deceased mother at the bedside,\r\nand cursed continuously (which her family found\r\ndistressing and far from her baseline personality).\r\nShe displayed frequent grimacing and moaning\r\nand was unable to swallow oral medications safely.\r\nMethadone and trazodone were stopped in the\r\nsetting of dysphagia. She was also unable to use\r\na PCA safely and it was discontinued. Based on\r\nthe previous 24 hour MEDD of 300 mg, continuous\r\nhydromorphone infusion was started at\r\n0.6 mg/hr with 1 mg IV available every 1 hour as\r\nneeded. Lidocaine infusion was discontinued for\r\ninefficacy and given concerns that she could no\r\nlonger accurately report side effects.\r\nOverall treatment goals were readdressed, and\r\nthe patient’s family continued to express hesitation\r\nabout adding more sedating medications for\r\ncomfort. At this time, our team made a recommendation\r\nto start a trial of dexmedetomidine\r\nin hopes that this would provide pain relief without\r\nsignificant sedation. This medication is available\r\nat our institution for patients with intractable\r\npain at end of life who are cared for in the\r\nInpatient Palliative Care Unit (see Appendix).\r\nDexmedetomidine was started at 0.1 mg/kg/hr\r\nusing adjusted body weight. Four hours after the\r\ninitiation of this infusion, she appeared more\r\ncomfortable at rest but continued to have grimacing\r\nand calling out with any stimulation (IV\r\npump beeping, touching her hand).\r\nDexmedetomidine was then increased to 0.2 mg/\r\nkg/hr. Chlorpromazine was also continued as a\r\nprn only (25 mg) to target agitated delirium.\r\nThe following day (HD12), the patient appeared\r\nmuch improved in terms of pain and agitation.\r\nGrimacing and moaning had resolved completely.\r\nShe was able to have some lucid periods, discussing\r\nher life with her daughters, though some\r\nbrief agitated intervals also occurred. Given that\r\nshe still was reporting residual pain during conversations\r\nwith her family, dexmedetomidine was\r\nincreased from 0.2 mg/kg/hour to 0.4 mg/kg/hr.\r\nBy HD 13, the patient was again experiencing\r\nworsened delirium with pronounced restlessness.\r\nShe had intermittent grimacing (though less pronounced\r\nthan on previous days prior to dexmedetomidine\r\ninitiation). She had received a dose\r\nprn chlorpromazine 25 mg overnight with good\r\nrelief of restlessness. Thus, this medication was\r\nscheduled 25 mg IV q 8 hours specifically to target\r\nterminal delirium. Dexmedetomidine was\r\nincreased to 0.5 mg/kg/hr and hydromorphone\r\ninfusion increased to 0.8 mg/hr to target residual\r\npain.\r\nJOURNAL OF PAIN & PALLIATIVE CARE PHARMACOTHERAPY 5\r\nIn the subsequent 3 days, on a regimen of dexmedetomidine\r\n0.5 mg/kg/hr, chlorpromazine\r\n25 mg IV q 8 hours, hydromorphone infusion at\r\n0.8 mg/hr, and hydromorphone 1 mg IV q 1 hour\r\nprn pain (MEDD in low 400 s at this time), the\r\npatient remained comfortable and markedly\r\nimproved from earlier in her course. She was\r\nnoted to be sleeping peacefully through most of\r\nthis time with no sustained episodes of grimacing,\r\nmoaning or restlessness. Dexmedetomidine\r\nwas again adjusted up to 0.6 mg/kg/hr on HD 15\r\nfor breakthrough pain during cleaning, but other\r\nmedications remained unchanged. She died peacefully\r\nwith her family present on the afternoon\r\nof HD16.\r\nDiscussion\r\nIn this complex case, dexmedetomidine was successfully\r\ndeployed as a co-analgesic treatment for\r\ncomplex pain at end of life. This represented the\r\nfirst use of a collaborative dexmedetomidine for\r\nanalgesia guideline developed by the palliative\r\ncare program at our institution (see Appendix).\r\nThis guideline was inspired by other deployments\r\nof dexmedetomidine for analgesia in the\r\npalliative care literature (17,20,26). Two of the\r\nauthors contacted colleagues within the Society\r\nof Pain and Palliative Care Pharmacy as well as\r\nother academic institutions across the country to\r\ngather supporting literature and example guidelines.\r\nFollowing the drafting of an initial guideline,\r\nan interprofessional group of palliative care\r\nexperts including licensed clinical social workers,\r\nnurse practitioners, pharmacists and physicians\r\nreviewed and refined the proposed guideline with\r\ninput from bedside registered nurses and unit\r\npharmacists. This group decided that it would be\r\neasiest to pilot dexmedetomidine for pain and\r\nget approval from the relevant groups if its use\r\nwas initially limited to the Inpatient Palliative\r\nCare Unit and only for patients who are at end\r\nof life and on comfort care. Once the multidisciplinary\r\ninpatient pain management committee\r\napproved the guideline, it was brought to our\r\ninstitutional Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee\r\nwho requested input from Critical Care. The\r\nCritical Care Committee determined that they\r\ndid not need to weigh in on the guideline and\r\nit was moved along for final approval from nurse\r\nand physician leadership.\r\nOne main difference in our guideline compared\r\nto most of the literature is that we administer\r\ndexmedetomidine infusion outside the\r\nintensive care unit without EKG or vital signs\r\nmonitoring Our guideline is restricted in patients\r\nat EoL with comfort care code status followed\r\nclosely in the palliative care unit. One report\r\nstates that EKG monitoring should be weighed\r\nagainst patients’ comorbidities, concomitant\r\nmedication, life expectancy and goals of care\r\n(13). Additionally, dexmedetomidine has a fairly\r\nshort half-life of 2-3 hours and would reach\r\nsteady state in a reasonable amount of time of\r\n15 hours (27). For this reason, we did not think\r\nit was necessary to include a loading dose in\r\nour guideline especially in a palliative care setting.\r\nFDA labeling recommends a loading dose\r\nof 1 mcg/kg and maintenance dose of 0.2 to 1\r\nmc/kg/hour (28). The FDA recommended maintenance\r\ndose is in line with our dosing range\r\nof 0.1 − 1 mcg/kg/hour. Our dexmedetomidine\r\nguideline recommends dose reduction by 50%\r\nfor patient with a CrcL <30 mL/min, moderate\r\nto severe hepatic impairment and those 65 years\r\nand older which is line with the guidance in\r\nthe literature for renal and hepatic impairment\r\nand elderly (29–31).\r\nFollowing approval, the inpatient pain management\r\ncommittee tasked a PharmD\r\nInformation Systems (IS) specialist to create an\r\norder set for the use of dexmedetomidine for\r\npain. This order set includes all the relevant\r\ndosing and monitoring guidance and is visible\r\nonly to those signed into the inpatient palliative\r\ncare context to limit inappropriate access by\r\nother providers.\r\nIn practice, we find that selection from the\r\nvarious intravenous co-analgesics available for the\r\nmanagement of pain can be challenging and\r\nnuanced. In this case, we did not use ketamine\r\ngiven active hallucinations. Lidocaine was initiated\r\nbefore dexmedetomidine due to the limitations\r\nof our institutional guidelines, which allow\r\nlidocaine to be used as a co-analgesic in any\r\npatient seen by palliative care, but limits dexmedetomidine\r\nusage to those at end of life and on\r\ncomfort care.\r\n6 J. M. BYRNE ET AL.\r\nIn this case, dexmedetomidine alone was not\r\nsufficient to palliate the terminal delirium, despite\r\nbeing administered at much higher doses than\r\nthe recent, promising open label single arm pilot\r\nstudy of just this phenomenon (32). In this case,\r\nchlorpromazine was effective in managing these\r\nsymptoms. Although we normally would’ve first\r\nused lorazepam for this indication, it was not\r\nused given that it was associated in time with\r\nincreased agitation and hallucinations earlier in\r\nthe hospital course and her family was reluctant\r\nto trial it again for this reason.\r\nThe safety of using agents for palliation combined\r\nwith dexmedetomidine is unknown and\r\nrequires much more research. Beyond very limited\r\nadmixture data demonstrating likely safety\r\nin admixtures with morphine, hydromorphone,\r\nand haloperidol (33), there is no guidance on\r\nsafety or effectiveness of combined therapies\r\nbeyond this case report. Although some guidelines\r\ninclude the use of electrocardiogram (ECG)\r\nor telemetry monitoring during the use of dexmedetomidine\r\nfor pain (13), our institution determined\r\nthat the burden of that monitoring\r\noutweighed the theoretical risk for those on comfort\r\ncare at the end of life.\r\nConclusion\r\nIn the case of complex cancer-related, mixed-type\r\npain at end of life accompanied by encephalopathy\r\nwith hypoactive delirium, dexmedetomidine\r\ncombined with hydromorphone and chlorpromazine\r\nprovided successful palliation without\r\nunwanted effects. This regimen had the advantage\r\nof allowing for lucid moments of communication\r\nwith family members during the patient’s\r\nfinal days. More research is needed to determine\r\nthe place in therapy of dexmedetomidine for\r\npatients being seen by specialist palliative\r\ncare teams.\r\nAcknowledgement\r\nThe authors are grateful to Dr. Nicole Hayes of the UCSDH\r\nIS, our Pharmacy Department, Pain Committee and\r\nPharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, and the bedside\r\nnurses who have supported the development and implementation\r\nof our dexmedetomidine for refractory pain\r\nguideline.\r\nDisclosure statement\r\nThe authors have nothing relevant to disclose.\r\nFunding\r\nThe author(s) reported there is no funding associated with\r\nthe work featured in this article.\r\nORCID\r\nKyle P.
