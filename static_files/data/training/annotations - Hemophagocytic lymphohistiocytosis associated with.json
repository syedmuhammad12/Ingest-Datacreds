The research progress\r\nmade in the HLH field raised awareness, allowing the\r\nimplementation of well-coded\r\nprotocol for a better management\r\nof such condition.\r\nHerein, and to the best of our knowledge, we report the\r\nfirst rare case of a woman with secondary HLH to hepatitis\r\nB virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection in\r\nMorocco.\r\nBesides the treatment for hepatitis, the patient also underwent\r\na specific therapy for HLH according to HLH-94\r\nprotocol, which resulted in general condition improvement,\r\ntransfusion independence, and splenomegaly resolution.\r\nOur report also stresses the main concepts and characteristics\r\nof the HLH as well the current consensus and international\r\nguidelines for better clinical outcomes of these\r\npatients.\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare and\r\nfatal condition, has been subjected to a very significant revival\r\nand extensive research in recent years, proven by substantial\r\nreports and publications. Such progress raised awareness on\r\nhow to establish a well-coded\r\nprotocol for a better management\r\nof such disease.\r\nHLH is the overstimulation of the immune system leading\r\nto systemic inflammation, cytokine storm, and multi-organ\r\nfailure.1 It is an heterogeneous group that can be divided into\r\ntwo categories: primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\r\n(HLH) and secondary hemophagocytic syndromes.2\r\nHerein, and to the best of our knowledge, we report the\r\nfirst rare case of a woman with secondary HLH to hepatitis\r\nReceived: 18 May 2020 | Revised: 21 April 2021 | Accepted: 29 April 2021\r\nDOI: 10.1002/ccr3.4328\r\nCASE REPORT\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis associated with HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection in adult: Case report\r\nMounia Bendari1,2 | Hanane Delsa2,3 | Nouama Bouanani1,2 | Rajaa Jabouri2,4 |\r\nSafaa Darouich1,2 | Sara Nejjari1,2 | Fadila Guessous2,5 | Kamal Doghmi1,2\r\n1Hematology Department, Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n2Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n3Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department, Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n4Internal Medicine Department, Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n5Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Casablanca, Morocco\r\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original\r\nwork is properly cited.\r\n© 2021 The Authors.

Upon antiviral treatment and chemotherapy, the\r\npatient achieved a complete remission.\r\nThis work prompts us to focus on more research and collaborative\r\nwork among physicians and aims at sharing information\r\nabout similarities and differences between cases,\r\nto improve the overall prognosis and management of such\r\ncondition.\r\n2 | CASE REPORT\r\nWe report a rare observation about a middle-aged\r\nwoman,\r\nwho is 47 years old, and she was initially referred to our\r\nhospital from Central Africa, where she was diagnosed with\r\nepigastralgia persisting for a few weeks associated with\r\nanemic syndrome and deterioration of the general state and\r\npersistent fever. The initial physical examination findings\r\nrevealed fever of 40°C without signs of infection, pulse of\r\n115/minutes, respiratory rate of 20/minutes, blood pressure\r\nof 110/60 mmHg, pallor with frank cutaneous and mucosal\r\njaundice as well as abdominal distension with hepatosplenomegaly,\r\nand important edema of the lower limbs. Vital signs\r\nand neurological examination were normal, and no oxygen\r\nwas required.\r\nUpon recent red cell transfusion, the biological assessment\r\nwith complete blood count revealed pancytopenia\r\n(hemoglobin level was at 5.8 g/dL, white blood cell counts\r\nat 2.4 × 103/L, neutrophil level at 1,3 × 103/L, lymphocyte\r\ncounts at 0,9 × 103/L, platelet counts at 10 × 103/L),\r\nC-reactive\r\nprotein level was at 88mg/L, procalcitonin was\r\nnegative, and existence of hypoalbuminemia at 24 g/L. The\r\nresearch of tuberculosis infections was negative. The rest of\r\nthe infectious workup did not show any toxoplasmosis or\r\nleishmaniasis infection, blood cultures were negative, and the\r\nrate of LDH was 2241 UI/L.\r\nThe assessment revealed a slight cytolysis, as well as\r\nsigns of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, dilated portal\r\nvein) and chronic liver disease that were shown during an\r\nabdominal ultrasound.\r\nThe upper gastroduodenoscopy displayed gastric vascular\r\nectasia, also known as “watermelon stomach” without associated\r\nesogastric varices. To assess the cause of cirrhosis, the\r\nviral serology of hepatitis B and hepatitis C was performed\r\nand it confirmed a coinfection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis\r\nC. The viral load results from the quantitative HCV-RNA\r\nand HBV-DNA\r\nin the serum were, respectively, 5,61 log UI/\r\nmL (407 380 UI/mL) and 2.02 log UI/mL (104 UI/mL).\r\nGiven the persistence of the fever and the worsening of\r\nthe patient general condition in the absence of any sign of infection,\r\na complementary assessment of febrile pancytopenia\r\nwas carried out and it revealed the presence of images of hemophagocytosis\r\nat the bone marrow aspiration (Figure 1), as\r\nwell as the existence of hyperferritinemia at 1535 ng/mL and\r\nhypertriglyceridemia at 3.9 g/L. On the basis of clinical and\r\nbiological criteria, the diagnosis retained was the association\r\nbetween a macrophagic activation syndrome and an HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection (codominant) with compensated cirrhosis.\r\nThe patient management combined the treatment for\r\nHLHs (etoposide+dexamethasone) according to the HLH-94\r\nprotocol and antiviral therapy for HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection\r\nwith supportive care.\r\nThe HLH-94\r\nprotocol consists of corticosteroids, typically\r\ndexamethasone daily (10 mg/m2 for 2 weeks, 5 mg/\r\nm2for 2 weeks, 2.5 mg/m2 for 2 weeks, then 1.25 mg/m2 for\r\n1 week, and taper until it is discontinued for one week). This\r\nwas followed by pulses every second week with 10 mg/m2 for\r\n3 days. Associated with etoposide, the aim of the treatment\r\nis to delete activated T cells and suppress inflammatory cytokine\r\nproduction.\r\nAll patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\r\nThe main complication of the treatment was corticosteroid-induced\r\ndiabetes. Treatment with etoposide was not the\r\nsource of major toxicity, and side effects were mainly nausea\r\nand vomiting.\r\nThe antiviral therapy was based on the European\r\nAssociation for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Guidelines\r\nand was mainly adapted to the available drugs in Morocco:\r\nsofosbuvir +daclatasvir for 6 months for hepatitis C and tenofovir\r\nfor hepatitis B.\r\nAfter 3 months of treatment, the evolution was favorable\r\nwith apyrexia, resolved cytopenia, and total disappearance\r\nof jaundice. The patient general condition was clearly improved\r\nwith regression of transfusion needs until transfusion\r\nFIGURE 1 Aspiration of the bone marrow (A) reveals\r\nan increased number of activated macrophages with prominent\r\nhemophagocytosis.

In this first description, it was also observed\r\nthat the bone marrow and the lymph nodes were infiltrated\r\nby macrophages of normal morphology, which phagocytized\r\nerythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes.3 The autopsy of six\r\nfatal cases showed subarachnoid and hepatic infiltration with\r\nhepatocyte necrosis. It was the first precise description of hemophagocytosis\r\nsyndrome.\r\nIn recent years, the pathophysiology of HLH has become\r\nwell understood thanks to the study of primary forms. It was\r\nacknowledged that HLH is due to a activation and/or cytotoxicity\r\ndefect of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which produce large\r\namounts of interferon γ that lead to an activation of macrophages\r\nin the bone marrow and reticuloendothelial cells,\r\nwhich in turn produce pro-inflammatory\r\ncytokine.4\r\nAs a result, plasma levels of pro-inflammatory\r\ncytokines\r\nIL-1,\r\nIL-6,\r\nTNF-α,\r\nIFN-γ,\r\nM-CSF,\r\nand IL-18\r\nwere elevated.\r\nThey are roughly divided into primary hemophagocytic\r\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and secondary hemophagocytic\r\nsyndromes. Primary HLH is the consequence of genetic mutations\r\naltering the cytotoxic function of the natural killer\r\n(NK) and cytotoxic T cells, which are generally found in\r\ninfancy and childhood. In addition, familial HLH (F HLH)\r\naffects patients who have autosomal recessive mutations affecting\r\nperforin (FHLH2), MUNC 13-4\r\n(UNC13D), STX11\r\n(coding for syntaxin 11), and STXBP2 (coding for syntaxin-binding\r\nprotein 2).5,6 It also includes other inherited immunodeficiency\r\nsyndromes with hypopigmentation such as\r\nChédiak-Higashi\r\nsyndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and type II\r\nHermansky-Pudlak\r\nsyndrome.7 On the other hand, secondary\r\nHLH usually affects adolescents and adults, but it is considered\r\nas a reactive syndrome. Most cases of secondary HLH\r\nare associated with “predisposing condition” causing immune\r\ndysregulation, such as malignancy (particularly lymphoma),\r\nimmunodeficiency, or autoimmune disease, and/or\r\na “trigger,” most commonly infection such as Epstein-Barr\r\nvirus (EBV).8 Among adults, infections represent the most\r\nprevalent triggers of HLH, with increasing age, and other\r\ncauses can be found such as malignancies, primarily lymphomas.\r\n9,10 As for our patient, the clinical presentation was\r\nconcordant with infectious disease, and the assessment of\r\nfever and jaundice. The etiological assessment showed a viral\r\nhepatitis B and hepatitis C infection; however, despite the antiviral\r\ntreatment, the persistence of the fever made us carry\r\nout more assessment at the research of HLH, which turned\r\nout to be positive.\r\nIn fact, the diagnosis of HLH among adults must be done\r\naccording to the HLH-2004\r\ndiagnostic criteria within clinical\r\njudgment and the patient's history.\r\nIn 1991, the Histiocyte Society suggests a standardized set\r\nof five diagnostic criteria for HLH used for the prospective\r\nHLH-94\r\nclinical trial. Such criteria were revised and validated\r\nin 2004, and the new standardized version included more diagnosis\r\ncriteria and stated that, for a positive diagnosis of HLH,\r\nindividuals need to meet five out of eight diagnostic criteria.11,12\r\nThe diagnosis of HLH can be confirmed if a molecular\r\ndiagnosis consistent with HLH, or the presence of the five\r\nfollowing criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting\r\n2 of 3 lineages in the peripheral blood), hemoglobin less than\r\n90 g/L (hemoglobin less than 100 g/L in infants, 4 weeks),\r\nplatelets less than 100 Giga/L, neutrophils less than 1 Giga/L,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, fasting triglycerides\r\nmore than 3.0 mmol/L (ie, more than 265 mg/dL),\r\nfibrinogen more than 1.5 g/L, hemophagocytosis in bone\r\nmarrow or spleen or lymph nodes, no evidence of malignancy,\r\nlow or no NK cell activity (according to local laboratory\r\nreference), ferritin more than 500 mg/L, and sCD25 (ie,\r\nsoluble IL-2\r\nreceptor) more than 2400 U/mL.13\r\nPatient characteristic and treatment\r\nClinical characteristics\r\nFever of 40°C\r\nPulse of 115/min\r\nBlood pressure of 110/60 mmHg\r\nCutaneous and mucosal jaundice\r\nHepatosplenomegaly\r\nBiological examination Hemoglobin : 5.8 g/dL\r\nWhite blood cells : 2.4 × 103/L\r\nNeutrophils : 1,3 × 103/L\r\nLymphocytes : 0,9 × 103/L\r\nPlatelets : 10 × 103/L\r\nHypertriglyceridemia : 3.9 g/L\r\nHyperferritinemia : 1535 ng/mL\r\nLDH : 2241 UI/L.\r\nHemophagocytosis at the bone marrow aspiration\r\nTABLE 1 Patient characteristics and\r\ntreatment\r\n20500904, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ccr3.4328 by National Medical Library The Director, Wiley Online Library on [13/10/2022].

These tools listed above proved useful\r\nto distinguish between HLH, septic shock, and conditions\r\nsuch as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They can also help as\r\na response for a therapy evaluation.\r\nFor our patient, all criteria for HLH were present; she was\r\nfebrile and had a splenomegaly, cytopenia, hyperferritinemia,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia, and specific images of hemophagocytosis.\r\nAdditionally, she was admitted to our unit with sepsis\r\nand pancytopenia, and therefore, exploring the presence of\r\nperipheral hemophagocytosis has been proposed quickly for\r\nidentifying adult secondary HLH.\r\nViral hepatitis is considered as the leading cause of chronic\r\nliver disease worldwide and the first cause of cirrhosis in\r\nAfrica. However, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C\r\nvirus (HCV) coinfection is a complex clinical entity that has\r\nan estimated worldwide prevalence of 1-15%.\r\n14 Most clinical\r\nstudies have shown that the progression of the disease is faster\r\nin HBV-HCV–\r\ncoinfected\r\npatients compared to those with\r\nmonoinfection, with high rates of decompensated cirrhosis15\r\nand increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.16 For our\r\npatient, the hepatitis B and hepatitis C coinfection was considered\r\nas the cause of HLH, as this viral infection could be the origin\r\nof T-cell\r\nactivation and inflammatory cytokine production.\r\nTreatment in coinfected patients is complex, especially due to\r\nthe interaction of the two viruses.\r\nUntil now, there are no clear treatment guidelines for HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection. But many studies showed good results with\r\nthe new drugs such as direct-acting\r\nantiviral agents.17 This\r\ntreatment should be discussed by all candidates for chemotherapy\r\nand immunosuppressive therapy with active viral\r\nhepatitis, especially hepatitis B.\r\nThe first-line\r\ntherapy in adults with infection-triggered\r\nHLH consists of antimicrobials. In these cases, the role\r\nof chemotherapy and immunosuppression is not clear.\r\nSometimes, systemic steroids can be added to antimicrobials,\r\nbut its benefits are unknown due to lack of data.18 In our case,\r\nbesides the treatment for hepatitis, the patient also underwent\r\nspecific therapy for HLH according to HLH-94\r\nprotocol,19\r\nwhich resulted in general condition improvement, transfusion\r\nindependence, and splenomegaly disappearance.\r\n4 | CONCLUSION\r\nDespite its low incidence, HLH is considered as a fatal disease\r\nand should be brought up quickly in the presence of any\r\nunexplained prolonged fever.\r\nIn our case, HLH was associated with an HCV-HBV\r\ncoinfection,\r\nwhich is very rare. The early concomitant treatment\r\nof viral hepatitis infection and HLH proved efficient for our\r\npatient.\r\nAll physicians should be aware of HLH because its early\r\nrecognition may prevent irreversible organ damage and subsequent\r\ndeath. They should not hesitate to realize the biological\r\nassessment and to repeat it if necessary to confirm the\r\npresence of HLH in order to be able to start the specific treatment\r\nin time, and thus improve the prognosis, which remains\r\nbleak for this pathology.\r\nOverall, the aim of this case report is to share our experience\r\nwith other fellow physicians caring for adult patients\r\nwith HLH combined with viral infection and to improve their\r\nclinical outcome.

The research progress\r\nmade in the HLH field raised awareness, allowing the\r\nimplementation of well-coded\r\nprotocol for a better management\r\nof such condition.\r\nHerein, and to the best of our knowledge, we report the\r\nfirst rare case of a woman with secondary HLH to hepatitis\r\nB virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection in\r\nMorocco.\r\nBesides the treatment for hepatitis, the patient also underwent\r\na specific therapy for HLH according to HLH-94\r\nprotocol, which resulted in general condition improvement,\r\ntransfusion independence, and splenomegaly resolution.\r\nOur report also stresses the main concepts and characteristics\r\nof the HLH as well the current consensus and international\r\nguidelines for better clinical outcomes of these\r\npatients.\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare and\r\nfatal condition, has been subjected to a very significant revival\r\nand extensive research in recent years, proven by substantial\r\nreports and publications. Such progress raised awareness on\r\nhow to establish a well-coded\r\nprotocol for a better management\r\nof such disease.\r\nHLH is the overstimulation of the immune system leading\r\nto systemic inflammation, cytokine storm, and multi-organ\r\nfailure.1 It is an heterogeneous group that can be divided into\r\ntwo categories: primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\r\n(HLH) and secondary hemophagocytic syndromes.2\r\nHerein, and to the best of our knowledge, we report the\r\nfirst rare case of a woman with secondary HLH to hepatitis\r\nReceived: 18 May 2020 | Revised: 21 April 2021 | Accepted: 29 April 2021\r\nDOI: 10.1002/ccr3.4328\r\nCASE REPORT\r\nHemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis associated with HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection in adult: Case report\r\nMounia Bendari1,2 | Hanane Delsa2,3 | Nouama Bouanani1,2 | Rajaa Jabouri2,4 |\r\nSafaa Darouich1,2 | Sara Nejjari1,2 | Fadila Guessous2,5 | Kamal Doghmi1,2\r\n1Hematology Department, Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n2Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n3Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department, Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n4Internal Medicine Department, Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco\r\n5Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Casablanca, Morocco\r\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original\r\nwork is properly cited.\r\n© 2021 The Authors.

Upon antiviral treatment and chemotherapy, the\r\npatient achieved a complete remission.\r\nThis work prompts us to focus on more research and collaborative\r\nwork among physicians and aims at sharing information\r\nabout similarities and differences between cases,\r\nto improve the overall prognosis and management of such\r\ncondition.\r\n2 | CASE REPORT\r\nWe report a rare observation about a middle-aged\r\nwoman,\r\nwho is 47 years old, and she was initially referred to our\r\nhospital from Central Africa, where she was diagnosed with\r\nepigastralgia persisting for a few weeks associated with\r\nanemic syndrome and deterioration of the general state and\r\npersistent fever. The initial physical examination findings\r\nrevealed fever of 40°C without signs of infection, pulse of\r\n115/minutes, respiratory rate of 20/minutes, blood pressure\r\nof 110/60 mmHg, pallor with frank cutaneous and mucosal\r\njaundice as well as abdominal distension with hepatosplenomegaly,\r\nand important edema of the lower limbs. Vital signs\r\nand neurological examination were normal, and no oxygen\r\nwas required.\r\nUpon recent red cell transfusion, the biological assessment\r\nwith complete blood count revealed pancytopenia\r\n(hemoglobin level was at 5.8 g/dL, white blood cell counts\r\nat 2.4 × 103/L, neutrophil level at 1,3 × 103/L, lymphocyte\r\ncounts at 0,9 × 103/L, platelet counts at 10 × 103/L),\r\nC-reactive\r\nprotein level was at 88mg/L, procalcitonin was\r\nnegative, and existence of hypoalbuminemia at 24 g/L. The\r\nresearch of tuberculosis infections was negative. The rest of\r\nthe infectious workup did not show any toxoplasmosis or\r\nleishmaniasis infection, blood cultures were negative, and the\r\nrate of LDH was 2241 UI/L.\r\nThe assessment revealed a slight cytolysis, as well as\r\nsigns of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, dilated portal\r\nvein) and chronic liver disease that were shown during an\r\nabdominal ultrasound.\r\nThe upper gastroduodenoscopy displayed gastric vascular\r\nectasia, also known as “watermelon stomach” without associated\r\nesogastric varices. To assess the cause of cirrhosis, the\r\nviral serology of hepatitis B and hepatitis C was performed\r\nand it confirmed a coinfection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis\r\nC. The viral load results from the quantitative HCV-RNA\r\nand HBV-DNA\r\nin the serum were, respectively, 5,61 log UI/\r\nmL (407 380 UI/mL) and 2.02 log UI/mL (104 UI/mL).\r\nGiven the persistence of the fever and the worsening of\r\nthe patient general condition in the absence of any sign of infection,\r\na complementary assessment of febrile pancytopenia\r\nwas carried out and it revealed the presence of images of hemophagocytosis\r\nat the bone marrow aspiration (Figure 1), as\r\nwell as the existence of hyperferritinemia at 1535 ng/mL and\r\nhypertriglyceridemia at 3.9 g/L. On the basis of clinical and\r\nbiological criteria, the diagnosis retained was the association\r\nbetween a macrophagic activation syndrome and an HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection (codominant) with compensated cirrhosis.\r\nThe patient management combined the treatment for\r\nHLHs (etoposide+dexamethasone) according to the HLH-94\r\nprotocol and antiviral therapy for HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection\r\nwith supportive care.\r\nThe HLH-94\r\nprotocol consists of corticosteroids, typically\r\ndexamethasone daily (10 mg/m2 for 2 weeks, 5 mg/\r\nm2for 2 weeks, 2.5 mg/m2 for 2 weeks, then 1.25 mg/m2 for\r\n1 week, and taper until it is discontinued for one week). This\r\nwas followed by pulses every second week with 10 mg/m2 for\r\n3 days. Associated with etoposide, the aim of the treatment\r\nis to delete activated T cells and suppress inflammatory cytokine\r\nproduction.\r\nAll patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.\r\nThe main complication of the treatment was corticosteroid-induced\r\ndiabetes. Treatment with etoposide was not the\r\nsource of major toxicity, and side effects were mainly nausea\r\nand vomiting.\r\nThe antiviral therapy was based on the European\r\nAssociation for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Guidelines\r\nand was mainly adapted to the available drugs in Morocco:\r\nsofosbuvir +daclatasvir for 6 months for hepatitis C and tenofovir\r\nfor hepatitis B.\r\nAfter 3 months of treatment, the evolution was favorable\r\nwith apyrexia, resolved cytopenia, and total disappearance\r\nof jaundice. The patient general condition was clearly improved\r\nwith regression of transfusion needs until transfusion\r\nFIGURE 1 Aspiration of the bone marrow (A) reveals\r\nan increased number of activated macrophages with prominent\r\nhemophagocytosis.

In this first description, it was also observed\r\nthat the bone marrow and the lymph nodes were infiltrated\r\nby macrophages of normal morphology, which phagocytized\r\nerythrocytes, platelets, and leukocytes.3 The autopsy of six\r\nfatal cases showed subarachnoid and hepatic infiltration with\r\nhepatocyte necrosis. It was the first precise description of hemophagocytosis\r\nsyndrome.\r\nIn recent years, the pathophysiology of HLH has become\r\nwell understood thanks to the study of primary forms. It was\r\nacknowledged that HLH is due to a activation and/or cytotoxicity\r\ndefect of CD8 T cells and NK cells, which produce large\r\namounts of interferon γ that lead to an activation of macrophages\r\nin the bone marrow and reticuloendothelial cells,\r\nwhich in turn produce pro-inflammatory\r\ncytokine.4\r\nAs a result, plasma levels of pro-inflammatory\r\ncytokines\r\nIL-1,\r\nIL-6,\r\nTNF-α,\r\nIFN-γ,\r\nM-CSF,\r\nand IL-18\r\nwere elevated.\r\nThey are roughly divided into primary hemophagocytic\r\nlymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and secondary hemophagocytic\r\nsyndromes. Primary HLH is the consequence of genetic mutations\r\naltering the cytotoxic function of the natural killer\r\n(NK) and cytotoxic T cells, which are generally found in\r\ninfancy and childhood. In addition, familial HLH (F HLH)\r\naffects patients who have autosomal recessive mutations affecting\r\nperforin (FHLH2), MUNC 13-4\r\n(UNC13D), STX11\r\n(coding for syntaxin 11), and STXBP2 (coding for syntaxin-binding\r\nprotein 2).5,6 It also includes other inherited immunodeficiency\r\nsyndromes with hypopigmentation such as\r\nChédiak-Higashi\r\nsyndrome, Griscelli syndrome, and type II\r\nHermansky-Pudlak\r\nsyndrome.7 On the other hand, secondary\r\nHLH usually affects adolescents and adults, but it is considered\r\nas a reactive syndrome. Most cases of secondary HLH\r\nare associated with “predisposing condition” causing immune\r\ndysregulation, such as malignancy (particularly lymphoma),\r\nimmunodeficiency, or autoimmune disease, and/or\r\na “trigger,” most commonly infection such as Epstein-Barr\r\nvirus (EBV).8 Among adults, infections represent the most\r\nprevalent triggers of HLH, with increasing age, and other\r\ncauses can be found such as malignancies, primarily lymphomas.\r\n9,10 As for our patient, the clinical presentation was\r\nconcordant with infectious disease, and the assessment of\r\nfever and jaundice. The etiological assessment showed a viral\r\nhepatitis B and hepatitis C infection; however, despite the antiviral\r\ntreatment, the persistence of the fever made us carry\r\nout more assessment at the research of HLH, which turned\r\nout to be positive.\r\nIn fact, the diagnosis of HLH among adults must be done\r\naccording to the HLH-2004\r\ndiagnostic criteria within clinical\r\njudgment and the patient's history.\r\nIn 1991, the Histiocyte Society suggests a standardized set\r\nof five diagnostic criteria for HLH used for the prospective\r\nHLH-94\r\nclinical trial. Such criteria were revised and validated\r\nin 2004, and the new standardized version included more diagnosis\r\ncriteria and stated that, for a positive diagnosis of HLH,\r\nindividuals need to meet five out of eight diagnostic criteria.11,12\r\nThe diagnosis of HLH can be confirmed if a molecular\r\ndiagnosis consistent with HLH, or the presence of the five\r\nfollowing criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting\r\n2 of 3 lineages in the peripheral blood), hemoglobin less than\r\n90 g/L (hemoglobin less than 100 g/L in infants, 4 weeks),\r\nplatelets less than 100 Giga/L, neutrophils less than 1 Giga/L,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, fasting triglycerides\r\nmore than 3.0 mmol/L (ie, more than 265 mg/dL),\r\nfibrinogen more than 1.5 g/L, hemophagocytosis in bone\r\nmarrow or spleen or lymph nodes, no evidence of malignancy,\r\nlow or no NK cell activity (according to local laboratory\r\nreference), ferritin more than 500 mg/L, and sCD25 (ie,\r\nsoluble IL-2\r\nreceptor) more than 2400 U/mL.13\r\nPatient characteristic and treatment\r\nClinical characteristics\r\nFever of 40°C\r\nPulse of 115/min\r\nBlood pressure of 110/60 mmHg\r\nCutaneous and mucosal jaundice\r\nHepatosplenomegaly\r\nBiological examination Hemoglobin : 5.8 g/dL\r\nWhite blood cells : 2.4 × 103/L\r\nNeutrophils : 1,3 × 103/L\r\nLymphocytes : 0,9 × 103/L\r\nPlatelets : 10 × 103/L\r\nHypertriglyceridemia : 3.9 g/L\r\nHyperferritinemia : 1535 ng/mL\r\nLDH : 2241 UI/L.\r\nHemophagocytosis at the bone marrow aspiration\r\nTABLE 1 Patient characteristics and\r\ntreatment\r\n20500904, 2021, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ccr3.4328 by National Medical Library The Director, Wiley Online Library on [13/10/2022].

These tools listed above proved useful\r\nto distinguish between HLH, septic shock, and conditions\r\nsuch as autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They can also help as\r\na response for a therapy evaluation.\r\nFor our patient, all criteria for HLH were present; she was\r\nfebrile and had a splenomegaly, cytopenia, hyperferritinemia,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia, and specific images of hemophagocytosis.\r\nAdditionally, she was admitted to our unit with sepsis\r\nand pancytopenia, and therefore, exploring the presence of\r\nperipheral hemophagocytosis has been proposed quickly for\r\nidentifying adult secondary HLH.\r\nViral hepatitis is considered as the leading cause of chronic\r\nliver disease worldwide and the first cause of cirrhosis in\r\nAfrica. However, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C\r\nvirus (HCV) coinfection is a complex clinical entity that has\r\nan estimated worldwide prevalence of 1-15%.\r\n14 Most clinical\r\nstudies have shown that the progression of the disease is faster\r\nin HBV-HCV–\r\ncoinfected\r\npatients compared to those with\r\nmonoinfection, with high rates of decompensated cirrhosis15\r\nand increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.16 For our\r\npatient, the hepatitis B and hepatitis C coinfection was considered\r\nas the cause of HLH, as this viral infection could be the origin\r\nof T-cell\r\nactivation and inflammatory cytokine production.\r\nTreatment in coinfected patients is complex, especially due to\r\nthe interaction of the two viruses.\r\nUntil now, there are no clear treatment guidelines for HBV-HCV\r\ncoinfection. But many studies showed good results with\r\nthe new drugs such as direct-acting\r\nantiviral agents.17 This\r\ntreatment should be discussed by all candidates for chemotherapy\r\nand immunosuppressive therapy with active viral\r\nhepatitis, especially hepatitis B.\r\nThe first-line\r\ntherapy in adults with infection-triggered\r\nHLH consists of antimicrobials. In these cases, the role\r\nof chemotherapy and immunosuppression is not clear.\r\nSometimes, systemic steroids can be added to antimicrobials,\r\nbut its benefits are unknown due to lack of data.18 In our case,\r\nbesides the treatment for hepatitis, the patient also underwent\r\nspecific therapy for HLH according to HLH-94\r\nprotocol,19\r\nwhich resulted in general condition improvement, transfusion\r\nindependence, and splenomegaly disappearance.\r\n4 | CONCLUSION\r\nDespite its low incidence, HLH is considered as a fatal disease\r\nand should be brought up quickly in the presence of any\r\nunexplained prolonged fever.\r\nIn our case, HLH was associated with an HCV-HBV\r\ncoinfection,\r\nwhich is very rare. The early concomitant treatment\r\nof viral hepatitis infection and HLH proved efficient for our\r\npatient.\r\nAll physicians should be aware of HLH because its early\r\nrecognition may prevent irreversible organ damage and subsequent\r\ndeath. They should not hesitate to realize the biological\r\nassessment and to repeat it if necessary to confirm the\r\npresence of HLH in order to be able to start the specific treatment\r\nin time, and thus improve the prognosis, which remains\r\nbleak for this pathology.\r\nOverall, the aim of this case report is to share our experience\r\nwith other fellow physicians caring for adult patients\r\nwith HLH combined with viral infection and to improve their\r\nclinical outcome.
