Qurashi®, A. Butt?\n\n\n\nOral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr\nTydfil, UK, 2Department of Restorative Dentistry, Cardiff University\nDental Hospital, Cardiff, UK\n\nBackground: This is a clinical case report of a 69-year-old male pre-\nsenting with a vertical bony defect distal of UL5. The patient suffers\nfrom heart failure and takes warfarin. The patient did not have any\nsymptoms but was aware of his periodontal diagnosis and as such was\nkeen to save his teeth. On presentation, the patient brushed twice\ndaily with a manual toothbrush however did no interdental cleaning.\nInitial plaque score was 63% and the patient had generalized\npocketing above 4 mm along with bleeding on probing. The UL5 had\n90% distal bone loss, grade 1 mobile and gave positive response to\ncold and electric testing.\n\nDescription of the procedure: 1. OHI with reduction in plague score\nto 7%. 2. Non-surgical supra and subgingival instrumentation using\nultrasonic scaler and hand scaling.\n\nOutcomes: 1. Radiographic review showed complete radiographic\nbone fill in the defect (6 mm vertical bone gain). 2. Clinical probing\ndepth improvement of 4 mm (from 8 to 4 mm). 3. Plaque score\nimprovement from 63% to 7%.\n\nConclusions: The case presents a successful outcome of a vertical\ndefect with non-surgical periodontal therapy and OHI and includes a\ndiscussion of the evidence base of management of vertical bone\ndefects with non-surgical techniques, conventional flap techniques,\nGTR and PRGF techniques.\n\nPC019: Non-surgical management of a severe drug\nrelated gingival enlargement: 3 years follow-up\nclinical case\n\nPoiares Baptista I, Martins O, Frango A, Nunes I, Rolo T, Domingues E, et al. Non-surgical management of a severe drug related gingival enlargement: 3 years follow-up clinical case. Journal of Clinical Periodontology. 2022;49(Supplement 23):296. DOI: 10.1111/jcpe.13637.\n\n\nDr. I. Poiares Baptistal, O. Martins, A Frango?, I. Nunes?, T. Rolo?\n\nE. Domingues, D. Santos Silva’, S. Matos*\n\nFaculty of Medicine, Institute of Periodontology, Area de Medicina\nDentdria, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal, 2Faculty of Medicine,\n\nArea de Medicina Dentdria, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal\n\nBackground: Nifedipine is a calcium channel-blocking drug, common\nantihypertensive medication. Gingival tissue enlargement is a frequent\nperiodontal side effect, associated to the presence of dental plaque.\n\nDescription of the procedure: In January 2018, a male 62-year-old\npatient was evaluated at the Dentistry Department of Coimbra\nUniversity Hospital. In January 2018, a male 62-year-old\npatient was evaluated at the Dentistry Department of Coimbra\nUniversity Hospital. His main complaint was gingival “swelling” and\nmasticatory difficulty. Anamnesis revealed hypertension medicated with\nNifedipine for 8 years. Besides partial edentulism and tooth migration,\noral observation highlighted severe bimaxillary gingival enlargement,\n\nnot restricted to the papillae, pronounced inflammation and periodontal\n\nattachment loss. Periodontal screening revealed 10 mm probing depth\n(PD) at several interdental sites, maximum clinical attachment loss (CAL)\nof 5 mm, bleeding on probing (BOP) of 61% and plaque index (PI) of\n100%. The patient was diagnosed Nifedipine Gingival Enlargement with\na Generalized Stage IV, Grade B Periodontitis. Non-surgical periodontal\ntreatment was initiated with oral hygiene instructions, supra and sub-\ngingival instrumentation. Simultaneously, his assistant physician rep-\nlaced nifedipine with enalapril. The patient attended regular periodontal\nappointments for 12 months. A decrease in gingival enlargement was\nnoted in the subsequent months. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, patient\nwas only reevaluated in May 2021.\n\nOutcomes: Three years after replacement of nifedipine and non-\nsurgical periodontal treatment, gingival enlargement was resolved.\nPeriodontitis was stabilized, as periodontogram revealed a mean\nreduction PD of 6 mm at the deepest sites, grade II furcation involve-\nments, BOP of 10% and PI of 34%. Step 3 periodontal therapy could\nbe initiated. Due to economic restrictions, oral rehabilitation could not\nbe fulfilled.\n\nConclusions: Severe gingival tissue enlargement related to nifedipine\nin a periodontitis IVB patient was resolved by non-surgical periodontal\ntreatment. Meticulous plaque control is mandatory. Communication\nwith the Physician is important to alter the medication and restore\npatient's quality of life.\n\nPC020: Chloramine gel and hyaluronic acid gel\nenhance effect of non-surgical instrumentation in\npersistent residual periodontal pockets - Preliminary\nreport from a clinical case series\n\nP. Liedloff*, H. Bilhan®, A. Friedmann®\nDepartment of Periodontology, Witten/Herdecke University, Witten,\n\nGermany\n\nBackground: Various adjunctive to non-surgical instrumentation strat-\negies are proposed to improve the healing outcome. Recent clinical\ntrials point out that chloramine gel (Perisolv) used during subgingival\ninstrumentation and followed by application of cross-linked\nhyaluronic acid (xHyA) for sealing the residual pocket at the SPT\nresults in significant reduction of inflammation (BoP) and an improved\nperiodontal pocket depth (PPD). The case series presents preliminary\nresults of an ongoing clinical study in SPT patients based upon PPD\nand BoP change.\n\nDescription of the procedure: Patients with diagnosis of periodontitis\nstage 3 and 4 who previously received non-surgical treatment and\npresented at SPT with persistent residual progredient pocket depths\n(>5 mm with BoP |) were consecutively enrolled. After reevaluation\nand reinstruction residual sites were instrumented repeatedly using\nchloramine gel application before and during subgingival scaling for\nseveral times. Local and aesthetics were used according to patient's\nrequest. After instrumentation completed, xHyA gel was applied sub-\n\ngingivally and patients were instructed to abstain from irrigating,\n\nsapiue 5530 usd 104 3deoxe ‘panied Jou ARDS S| uORNGUISIP pue Bsn-aY *[z202/80/70] UO ~J038.iq BY 1 AIBIqrT [E31PSIN [eUCHEN Ag ‘wo As|wAlBiqIiBuI[uO//SdNY WoL papeojumMOd ‘GY ‘2202 XLS0009L\n\f",{"entities":[[1721,1991,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1994,1997,"REPORTERTITLE"],[1998,2000,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[2001,2018,"REPORTERMIDDLENAME"],[2128,2155,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[2184,2205,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[2207,2214,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[2216,2224,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[2238,2246,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[2308,2316,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[2330,2340,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2413,2440,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[2559,2571,"DRUGENDDATE"],[2575,2579,"PATIENTSEX"],[2580,2591,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[2882,2894,"DRUGINDICATION"],[2910,2920,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[2925,2926,"DRUGSTARTPERIOD"],[2927,2933,"DRUGSTARTPERIODUNIT"],[2934,3142,"TESTRESULT"],[3143,3340,"TESTRESULT"],[3367,3398,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[3406,3450,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[3734,3754,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[3959,3993,"REACTIONOUTCOME"],[3994,4022,"REACTIONOUTCOME"],[4024,4160,"TESTRESULT"],[4359,4372,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[5506,5519,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"]]}]]}
