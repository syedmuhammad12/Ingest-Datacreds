In the pediatric population,\r\nincidence remains steady at 0.3–0.8/100,000 in older children\r\nand adolescents.1 There is an increased risk of IE in children with\r\nunderlying heart disease or valvular abnormalities.2,3 We describe\r\na 19-year-old male with a 5-month long illness treated with multiple\r\nantibiotics. He was eventually diagnosed with IE with septic\r\nemboli and aortic root abscess.\r\nCASE REPORT\r\nA 19-year-old male with a congenitally diagnosed bicuspid\r\naortic valve presented to NYU Langone Hospital-Long Island with\r\na 5-month history of fatigue, intermittent cough, rashes, intermittent\r\nfevers, 25-pound weight loss, and migrating joint pain. Five\r\nweeks before presentation, he developed night sweats, and fevers\r\nbecame daily and continuous. Patient had no international travel\r\nhistory and resided in Long Island, NY. He denied any recent dental\r\nwork or intravenous drug use. He was seen by his primary care provider,\r\ndiagnosed with clinical pneumonia, and given azithromycin\r\nwith improvement. A week after discontinuation of antibiotics, he\r\ndeveloped a red blotchy rash on the plantar surface of his right foot\r\nwith recurrence of fever. His primary care provider diagnosed him\r\nwith cellulitis and started him on amoxicillin-clavulanate with resolution\r\nof rash and defervescence. Approximately 2–3 weeks later,\r\nfevers recurred, accompanied by a painful, petechial rash to the sole\r\nof his foot (Fig. 1). He was restarted on amoxicillin-clavulanate\r\nwith resolution of rash and fevers. Bloodwork done at that time,\r\nincluding antinuclear antibody, tuberculosis testing, HIV, Hepatitis\r\nA-C serology, and Babesia microti serology, was unremarkable.\r\nHe was evaluated by his outpatient cardiologist, where echocardiogram\r\nshowed no change to his underlying bicuspid aortic valve\r\nand limited visualization of the mitral valve. The patient was\r\nreferred to rheumatology for further evaluation after rheumatoid\r\nfactor returned mildly positive. A working diagnosis of familial\r\nMediterranean fever was considered by rheumatology; the patient\r\nwas empirically started on colchicine without improvement. He\r\nwas referred to oncology, where concern for lymphoma prompted\r\nimaging. CT scan of his chest and abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly\r\nand subcentimeter axillary lymph nodes. positron emission\r\ntomography scan showed hepatosplenomegaly and diffuse, mildly\r\nincreased uptake within the bone marrow and tonsils. A bone marrow\r\nbiopsy was recommended. The patient saw another oncologist\r\nwho drew basic labs and, for the first time, a blood culture, which\r\ngrew Gram-positive cocci in pairs. He presented to our pediatric\r\nemergency room for further workup and management.\r\nIn the emergency room, he was febrile (101.1°F) and tachycardic\r\n(heart rate 125). Antibiotic therapy was initiated with 2 g of\r\nintravenous ceftriaxone. Patient was noted to have rash on the bilateral\r\nplantar surfaces of his feet and the dorsum of his hands with\r\ntenderness to palpation. Patient was noted to have a grade II/VI\r\nmidsystolic murmur heard best at the upper left sternal border; his\r\nmother reported this was not a new finding.\r\nTransthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on admission showed\r\n2 small masses in the 4–6 × 10–14 mm range on the anterior leaflet\r\nof the mitral valve (Fig. 2A). The bicuspid aortic valve showed\r\nmoderate dysfunction with mild-to-moderate insufficiency and\r\naccompanying left ventricular dilation and a mildly dilated ascending\r\naorta. There was trivial mitral valve insufficiency. In combination\r\nwith the positive blood culture from the outside hospital, he\r\nwas diagnosed with IE. Gentamicin was added to his therapy as per\r\nAHA recommendations.4 He was evaluated by dental and had no\r\nevidence of obvious caries, however, he reported he had not seen\r\na dentist in over 5 years. On hospital day 2, blood culture grew\r\nStreptococcus mutans and gentamicin was discontinued. An MRA/\r\nmagnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple small\r\nseptic emboli (Fig. 3A). CT angiogram of the head and neck were\r\nunremarkable. Because of concern for potential deterioration and\r\nneed for cardiothoracic surgical intervention, the patient was transferred\r\nto NYU Langone Hospital in Manhattan, NY.\r\nUpon transfer, patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram,\r\nwhich showed vegetations on the aortic and mitral valves\r\n(Fig. 2B). An abscess near the aortic root with evidence of dissection\r\nand an 8 mm aneurysm of the intervalvular fibrosa were\r\nseen alongside moderate regurgitation with moderate stenosis of\r\nthe aortic valve (Fig. 2C). Magnetic resonance imaging of the\r\nabdomen was ordered secondary to abdominal pain, and revealed\r\na thick-walled rim enhancement with internal septations consistent\r\nFIG. 1.

Percutaneous drainage of the abscess was\r\nattempted by interventional radiology but minimal fluid was aspirated.\r\nLaparoscopic splenectomy was performed to reduce the risk\r\nof reinfection after heart surgery. Given extensive valvular involvement\r\nand severe aortic stenosis with regurgitation, the aortic valve\r\nwas replaced using a pulmonary autograft (Ross) procedure. Mitral\r\nvalve vegetations were removed with valve repair. Gram stain of\r\nthe valve tissue showed Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains;\r\nculture was negative. Patient tolerated the procedure well with\r\nnotable improvement. Patient continued on ceftriaxone; gentamicin\r\nwas initially restarted and stopped early in the postoperative course\r\nbecause of worsening renal function. The patient was later switched\r\nto penicillin for a total of 6 weeks.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThis case highlights the importance of obtaining blood\r\ncultures in fever of unknown origin cases where appropriate. The\r\npatient with fever of unknown origin may have a broad differential\r\ndiagnosis, which can include rheumatologic and neoplastic disorders.\r\nHowever, patients with known congenital heart disease (CHD)\r\nand persistent fever should be presumed to have endocarditis until\r\nproven otherwise. Literature has supported a higher incidence of IE\r\nin patients with CHD for years.2,3 In our patient, the diagnosis of\r\nIE was confounded by a positive rheumatoid factor, which can be\r\npresent in up to 36% of patients with IE.5 Symptoms of joint pain,\r\nrash, fevers, and weight loss can be seen in both IE and rheumatologic\r\ndisorders.\r\nOur patient’s echocardiogram 1 month before presentation\r\ndid not show evidence of vegetations, however, sensitivity of TTE\r\nfor diagnosis of endocarditis is approximately 70%, and additional\r\nimaging (transesophageal echocardiogram) was indicated.6 The\r\nacute change in TTE imaging suggests rapid development of vegetations\r\nover the following weeks, and seeding of the mitral valve\r\nin the setting of severe aortic valve regurgitation. The vegetation\r\nwas discovered on the anterior leaflet of the atrial side of the mitral\r\nvalve, which is more commonly appreciated in the elderly and\r\nFIG 2.
