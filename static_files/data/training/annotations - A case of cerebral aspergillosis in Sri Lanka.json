In accordance with most systemic fungal infections,\r\nimmunocompromised patients are the predominant victims affected. Nonspecific clinical\r\nand radiological features may contribute to difficulty and delay in diagnosis, further\r\ncontributing to the poor prognosis of cerebral aspergillosis. Obtainment of proper\r\nspecimens for laboratory diagnosis is a key to make a timely diagnosis that may be\r\nlifesaving. Case Report: A 74 year old female presented with a frontal headache for 2\r\nweeks' duration.She had been diagnosed with a low-grade lymphoma and had\r\ncompleted the chemotherapy and high-dose prednisolone 4 weeks prior to this\r\npresentation. Other than the frontal headache, which progressed slowly over 2 weeks,\r\nshe did not disclose any associated symptoms. Physical examination was normal, with\r\nneither sign of raised intracranial pressure nor of a CNS infection. Basic investigations\r\nrevealed no abnormalities, and the white cell count was 7.5 Ã—109/l and the CRP was 7\r\nmg/l. An MRI of the brain indicated right frontal sinusitis with a secondary small abscess\r\nin the right frontal lobe inferiorly. Therefore, she was treated with parenteral antibiotics\r\nfor a bacterial infection and was discharged. The patient presented with a headache\r\nagain after 3 months. A repeat MRI of the brain revealed an increase in the size of the\r\nlesion in the right frontal lobe and the possibility of a cerebral tumor was suggested. A\r\ndiagnostic biopsy was performed, and the specimen was subjected to fungal\r\nstudies.The direct microscopic examination revealed fungal filaments and the culture\r\nyielded a pure growth of Aspergillus fumigatus. She was started on intravenous\r\namphotericin B, followed by oral voriconazole. Her headache gradually subsided with\r\nantifungal therapy. The duration of therapy was guided by serial radiological imaging,\r\nand the patient achieved a complete recovery at the end of 1-year of treatment. She\r\nremains asymptomatic to date, after 2 years of treatment completion. Discussion:\r\nImmunocompromised patients with cerebral aspergillosis may present with minimal\r\nclinical symptoms and signs. Obtaining a proper specimen for laboratory testing is vital\r\nto arrive at a definitive diagnosis. Radiological investigations may play an important role\r\nin the diagnosis as well as during the follow-up of a patient with cerebral aspergillosis.\r\nAppro-priate antifungal treatment for a prolonged duration, with or without neurosurgical\r\nintervention and reversal or reduction of immunosuppressive therapy leads to a good\r\nprognosis.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nRecord downloaded - Fri 2 17 05:02:13 UTC 2023 Page 3\r\n amphotericin B; antibiotic agent; prednisolone; voriconazole\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n central nervous system aspergillosis; Sri Lanka\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\n abscess; aged; antifungal therapy; Aspergillus fumigatus; bacterial infection; brain\r\ntumor; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; case report; central nervous system\r\ninfection; chemotherapy; clinical article; conference abstract; diagnosis; drug\r\nmegadose; drug therapy; female; follow up; frontal lobe; frontal sinusitis; headache;\r\nhuman; human tissue; immunocompromised patient; immunosuppressive treatment;\r\nintracranial hypertension; intravenous drug administration; laboratory diagnosis;\r\nlaboratory test; leukocyte count; microscopy; neuroimaging; nonhodgkin lymphoma;\r\nnonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical examination; prognosis;\r\nradiology; treatment duration\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\n amphotericin B (1397-89-3, 30652-87-0)\r\n prednisolone (50-24-8)\r\n voriconazole (137234-62-9, 188416-29-7)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\n English\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\n English\r\nPUI\r\n L639787142\r\nDOI\r\n 10.1093/mmy/myac072.P287\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mmy/myac072.P287\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L639787142&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",{"entities":[[8,53,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[70,139,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[287,297,"REPORTERCITY"],[299,314,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[558,559,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[560,568,"REPORTERMIDDLENAME"],[569,579,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[616,679,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[681,696,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[744,793,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1337,1551,"SERIOUSNESSOTHER"],[1700,1723,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1857,1868,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[1869,1875,"PATIENTSEX"],[1914,1915,"DRUGLASTPERIOD"],[1917,1922,"DRUGLASTPERIODUNIT"],[1973,1981,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[2005,2017,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[2022,2031,"DRUGDOSAGETEXT"],[2032,2044,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2200,2220,"TESTNAME"],[2225,2274,"TESTRESULT"],[2314,2328,"TESTNAME"],[2339,2355,"TESTRESULT"],[2365,2381,"TESTNAME"],[2386,2389,"TESTRESULT"],[2390,2396,"TESTUNIT"],[2405,2408,"TESTNAME"],[2413,2414,"TESTRESULT"],[2416,2421,"TESTUNIT"],[2452,2498,"TESTRESULT"],[2718,2734,"TESTNAME"],[2735,2782,"TESTRESULT"],[2961,2984,"TESTNAME"],[2985,3010,"TESTRESULT"],[3019,3026,"TESTNAME"],[3028,3075,"TESTRESULT"],[5152,5182,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"]]}]]}
