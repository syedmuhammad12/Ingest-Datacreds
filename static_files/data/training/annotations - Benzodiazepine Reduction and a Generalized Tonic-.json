A 21-year-old woman with\na history of preterm birth, patent ductus\narteriosus, neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic compensated hydrocephalus,\nprediabetes mellitus, polycystic ovarian syndrome, mild intellectual disability, and\nautism spectrum disorder was referred to\noutpatient mental health services. Her only\nprevious seizure had been age 15 years,\nwhile taking sertraline and quetiapine and\nshe was not subsequently on anticonvulsants.\nShe had previously been treated since the age\nof 13 years for social withdrawal, poor sleep,\nreduced appetite, and hearing voices after a\nsuspected bullying incident on a school trip,\nwhich gradually deteriorated, characterized\nby poor occupational function, lack of motivation, and mutism. Previous trials of sertraline, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole\nwere unsuccessful.\nAfter transition to adult mental health\nservices at the age of 18 years, she was\nreassessed, and it was observed that she\npresented with features of catatonia, including mutism, staring, stereotypy, waxy\nflexibility, and tachycardia with a heart rate\nranging from 135 to 145 per minute during\nclinical reviews, meeting Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth\nEdition) criteria for catatonic disorder not otherwise specified. Using the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, she scored 7 of 14 on the\nscreening instrument and 16 of 69 for severity. She was treated for catatonia in autism\nwith oral lorazepam (off-label use) with the\nintention of using electroconvulsive therapy\n(ECT) if this was unsuccessful. As an outpatient, lorazepam was titrated slowly for\n10 months to a total daily dose of 16 mg in divided doses without any improvement, so a\ndecision was made to restart sertraline at\n50 mg and to wean down the benzodiazepine\ndose by switching to diazepam because of its\nlonger half-life. Lorazepam (16 mg) was converted to 50 mg of diazepam (off-label), and\nsertraline was increased to 100 mg.\n\nW\n\n218\n\nwww.ectjournal.com\n\nThree days after the switch from lorazepam to diazepam, the patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at home lasting\n7 minutes. She was transferred to the emergency department, where she had a further\nseizure. There was evidence of a mild inflammatory response with a white blood\ncell count of 12.5 \u0002 109/L, C-reactive protein of 28 mg/L, platelets of 454 \u0002 109/L,\nand initial lactate of 8.0 mmol/L, which\nnormalized on repeat. No cause of seizure\nwas identified, and no evidence of other\nsymptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal\nwas noted. She had no further seizures after\ndischarge.\nAfter the seizure, the dose of diazepam was held at 50 mg for 3 weeks before\nrestarting the reducing regimen. For the\nfirst 2 days after the seizures, she was\npostictal and drowsy. However, by day\n7, the patient's presentation changed, and\nshe was noted to become substantially more\ncommunicative. She was described as chatty\nand asked questions about her diagnosis and\nher medication for the first time in years.\nIn the next few months, as diazepam was\ngradually reduced, the improvement in\nsymptoms was sustained. She continued\nto communicate more, both verbally and\nby using messages on her mobile. Because\nof coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions,\nthe further reduction in diazepam has been\nmanaged in the community, with telephone\nconsultations only, hitherto uneventfully, so\nmonitoring with the Bush Francis Catatonia\nRating Scale has not been possible. She was\nreviewed by cardiology 3 months after the\nseizure because of persistent tachycardia.\nBy this time, the tachycardia had improved\nto 102 per minute, which was thought to\nbe due to iron deficiency anemia. Her improvement does not seem to have been\nsustained in the long term.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first report of improvement of catatonia after a\nseizure in the context of benzodiazepine\nreduction. Benzodiazepine equivalences\nare not universally agreed, but 50 mg of\ndiazepam may be a lower dose than 16 mg\nof lorazepam,1 which could have been a factor, in addition to her underlying vulnerabilities. Autism spectrum disorder is associated\nwith an increased propensity to seizures.2\nFurthermore, the increase in sertraline from\n50 mg to 100 mg may have been a precipitating factor, as her only previous seizure\nalso occurred when she was treated with\nsertraline. Finally, given the mild inflammatory response noted in the emergency\ndepartment, an infection may have been a\ncontributing factor.\n\nThere are a number of possible triggers\nfor the improvement in the patient's symptoms.\nFirst, the high dose of lorazepam may\nhave had a sedative effect, which improved\nafter a dose reduction. This seems unlikely,\ngiven that the patient had these symptoms\nbefore lorazepam treatment and benzodiazepines do not tend to cause features such as\nwaxy flexibility, stereotypy, and tachycardia.\nSecond, sertraline may have treated an\nunderlying anxiety or depressive illness.\nAgain, this seems improbable because sertraline previously had little effect and the\ndramatic improvement occurred within days\nof increasing the dose.\nThird, we suggest that the most likely\nreason for the patient's improvement is that\nthe seizure was therapeutic for the catatonic\nstate. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is known\nto sometimes precipitate catatonia.3 However, ECT is a recommended and evidencebased treatment for catatonia. Before the\nuse of ECT, pharmacological provocation\nof seizures using a variety of agents had\nbeen used as a treatment of catatonia.4 It\nis therefore plausible that a seizure induced\nby withdrawal of a medication might be\nequally effective.\nTreatment of catatonia in autism is\nsupported only by case reports and case\nseries, which suggest that benzodiazepines\nand ECT should be used.5 In this case, given\nthat lorazepam was unsuccessful, ECTwould\nhave been an appropriate treatment and could\nhave been considered given that her hydrocephalus was stable.\nThis report supports the notion that\nECT should be considered early as a potential therapeutic modality in catatonia\nin autism even when there is no immediate\nrisk to life. It also provides a caution about\ngradual titration of benzodiazepines in catatonia, as it can cause tolerance and may\nrisk withdrawal seizures, especially in individuals with risk factors for seizures. Finally,\nthis case illustrates a complex relationship between seizures and catatonia, because catatonia can be a manifestation of nonconvulsive\nstatus epilepticus.\nA number of features of this case may\nlimit the applicability to many patients with\ncatatonia and autism, given her complex\nmedical history. However, it illustrates an\nimportant paradoxical response to a reduction in benzodiazepine dose.\nSarah Parry\nSouth London and Maudsley NHS\nFoundation Trust\nLondon, UK\n\nJournal of ECT • Volume 38, Number 3, September 2022\n\nCopyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although there is\nlittle prospective research on the treatment of\ncatatonia, benzodiazepines are the mainstay\nof treatment, with retrospective data in child\nand adolescent patients showing a 65% response rate to benzodiazepine treatment.3\nIn chronic catatonia, however, the role of\nbenzodiazepines is less clear, with the only\nprospective trial of lorazepam in that setting demonstrating no benefit.4 Numerous\ncase reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in\nthe treatment of medication-refractory acute\ncatatonia. For instance, 8 of 9 adult catatonic\npatients—including 5 who did not respond to\nintravenous (IV) amobarbital—had a favorable response to ECT.5 The use of ECT in\nprolonged catatonia and in refractory symptoms in young patients is less discussed.\nHere, we present a case of benzodiazepinerefractory catatonia of 4 months duration in\nan adolescent patient who rapidly resolved\nwith ECT treatment.\nThe patient was a 16-year-old adolescent boy who before presentation was typically developing, attending regular high school\nclasses and with no chronic medical or psychiatric conditions. He took no medications\nand had no family history of psychiatric illness. Per family, the patient had the acute\nonset of behavioral changes, including decreased speech, behavioral isolation, and\nslowed movements. Approximately 10 days\nafter symptom onset, the patient stopped\neating or drinking and had minimal speech;\nthe family then brought him to an outside\nemergency department. The patient's initial\nexamination was notable for mutism, staring,\nslowed gait, and stereotyped movements. His\ntone was noted to be normal, although the\npatient did not cooperate with the motor examination. Brain magnetic resonance imaging without the administration of IV contrast\nand 8-hour electroencephalography recording\nwere normal, as were laboratory findings\nincluding a serum autoimmune panel, basic\nmetabolic panel, vitamin D, rapid plasma\nreagin, and HIV screening. The diagnosis\nof catatonia was made with an initial BushFrancis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS)\nof 18. The patient was admitted to the pediatrics service of the outside hospital where\nhe was started on lorazepam 2 mg IV 3\ntimes daily without significant response.\nOver the following month, he remained\non the pediatrics floor and was followed\nby consult liaison psychiatry, with multiple medication trials including olanzapine\nup to 2.5 mg twice daily (resulting in increased\ncatatonic features and urinary incontinence),\naripiprazole 2 mg, and escitalopram 10 mg\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nfor empiric treatment of a possible depressive episode. Given ongoing minimal intake by mouth (PO), the patient was started\non enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube.\nOn hospital day 41, he was transferred\nto the pediatric medical-psychiatric unit at\nthe outside hospital, where lorazepam was\nincreased to a dose of 6 mg PO 3 times\ndaily with some improvement in catatonic\nfeatures, but he continued to demonstrate\nwithdrawal, staring, stereotypies, and minimal PO intake requiring ongoing nasogastric tube feeds. He began to display some\nsymptoms of self-dialoguing and paranoia,\nwhich were thought consistent with catatonic schizophrenia, so he was trialed on a\nseries of antipsychotic medications (aripiprazole up to 5 mg daily; risperidone up to\n6 mg daily; haloperidol up to 20 mg daily)\nwithout significant response.\nGiven lack of therapeutic improvement,\nECT consultation from our hospital was\nsought on hospital day 118, and the patient\nwas deemed an appropriate candidate for\nECT. He was transferred to the pediatrics\nfloor of our hospital on day 129, where\nBFCRS was 15; ECT was initiated the following day. Because of the severity of illness,\nno dose titration was conducted, and ECT\nwas started with bilateral electrode placement (Mecta Spectrum 5000Q: pulse width\n0.5 ms, frequency 40 Hz, duration 6 seconds,\ncurrent 800 mA, 192 mC) with methohexital\nanesthesia and succinylcholine muscle relaxant. After 2 ECT treatments, the BFCRS was\nreduced to 8, and after his third treatment (bilateral, 0.5 ms, 40 Hz, 8 seconds, 256 mC),\nhe began eating spontaneously (BFCRS 7).\nAs the patient's catatonia began to lyse,\nthere was the emergence of greater psychotic\nsymptoms for which quetiapine was initiated,\nwith ultimate cross-taper to aripiprazole. His\ncatatonia continued to improve with ECT,\nwith the BFCRS reduced to 2 after 7 treatments.\nHe was ultimately discharged after 17 ECT\ntreatments on hospital day 167 (38 days after\ntransfer). Catatonia was in full remission at that\ntime, and discharge medications were aripiprazole 15 mg daily, clonazepam 2 mg twice\ndaily, and memantine 10 mg twice daily.\nThis case highlights the critical role of\ntimely access to ECT in the treatment of\npediatric catatonia. This patient's catatonia\nwas recognized rapidly, but despite prompt\ntreatment with lorazepam, his catatonic symptoms did not improve, as is the case for 35%\nof pediatric catatonia patients.3 It is possible\nthat a higher lorazepam dose or alternative\ncatatonia pharmacotherapy (eg, glutamatergic\nagents) may have been helpful if attempted\nearlier. There is clearly a need for better pharmacotherapy options for pediatric catatonia,\nas in this case numerous medication trials\ndid not result in improvement: indeed, the\npatient's BFCRS did not change substantially\n\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
