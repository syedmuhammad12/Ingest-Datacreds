The development of HVOD can be rapid and unpredictable,\r\nthus the recognition of the main HVOD risk factors and close monitoring of them are\r\nessential for the optimal complication management. The HVOD diagnosis has\r\ntraditionally been based on the Baltimore or modified Seattle criteria, which assess the\r\ncommon signs and symptoms of HVOD, that typically takes part during the first three\r\nweeks after transplantation. The symptoms of HVOD are dynamic, variable and can be\r\nprogressive. This complication is relatively frequent after HIC used for allogeneic HSCT;\r\nhowever, it is unusual in an autologous HSCT. Methods: The first of the cases is a 43\r\nyears old woman with a diagnosis of IgA multiple myeloma ISS IIIA/ISS-R 2, who\r\nreceived autologous tandem transplantation after induction chemotherapy with two\r\ncycles of Bortezomib + Cyclophosphamide + Dexamethasone and five cycles of\r\nCarfilzomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone due to progression. In the first transplant\r\nshe arrived with a partial response, BUMEL conditioning was used. On day +25 she\r\npresents signs compatible with HVOD: hepatomegaly, ascites with increase in weight\r\nand hyperbilirubinemia. Defibrotide® was administered during 23 days, and condition\r\nimproves. Subsequently, a second autologous HSCT was carried out with disease\r\nprogression. A conditioning with MEL200 was used and the patient did not present\r\nsigns compatible with HVOD. Secondly, a 29 year old man with acute promyelocytic\r\nleukemia diagnosis achieved complete remission (CR) after induction treatment.\r\nHowever, three years later he presented clinical and molecular relapse, for this, rescue\r\nchemotherapy treatment was administered reaching CR again. He was admitted to\r\nautologous HSCT, performing BEA regimen conditioning. On day +13, he presented\r\nworsening of liver analytical parameters with increased bilirubin and transamintases,\r\nsevere hydropic decompensation with weight gain of more than five kilos, and painful\r\nhepatomegaly. Due to the high suspicion of HVOD and the clinical and analytical\r\nworsening with bilirubin 8.6 mg/dL, Defibrotide® is applied assuming hemorrhagic risk,\r\nbecause at that time he presents severe thrombopenia and coagulopathy, in\r\nconsequence a prophylactic transfusion of platelets and antithrombin is prescribed\r\nduring the first days; Ursodeoxycholic Ac is also associated. After these measures and\r\n21 days of Defibrotide® treatment, the patient presented a favorable evolution. Results:\r\nIn both cases It can be observed as risk factors for the HVOD development: Busulfan\r\nadministration as conditioning and the performance of an autologous HSCT.\r\nConclusions: Identifying patients with higher risk of HVOD could be the key for the early\r\ndiagnosis and unanticipated treatment with Defibrotide®, which is also associated with\r\nRecord downloaded - Fri 2 17 05:03:07 UTC 2023 Page 3\r\nbetter results. Some investigators have suggested that drug treatment should begin with\r\nthe first possible HVOD signs/symptoms, even if patients do not already meet all the\r\ncriteria for a complete diagnosis. Furthermore, although the review data indicate that\r\nthis complication occurs more frequently after allogeneic transplantation, recent studies\r\nin adult and pediatric patients with autologous HSCT reported an increasing incidence\r\nof this complication.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\n antithrombin; bilirubin; busulfan; dexamethasone; endogenous compound;\r\nimmunoglobulin A\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n autologous stem cell transplantation; liver venoocclusive disease; relapse\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\n adult; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; allotransplantation;\r\nanalytical parameters; ascites; autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation;\r\nblood clotting disorder; body weight gain; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; case\r\nreport; chemotherapy; child; clinical article; complication; conference abstract;\r\ndiagnosis; drug therapy; early diagnosis; female; hepatomegaly; human; human cell;\r\nhuman tissue; hyperbilirubinemia; incidence; induction chemotherapy; leukemia\r\nremission; male; multiple myeloma; pediatric patient; promyelocytic leukemia; risk\r\nfactor; surgery; thrombocytopenia\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\n antithrombin (9000-94-6)\r\n bilirubin (18422-02-1, 635-65-4)\r\n busulfan (55-98-1)\r\n dexamethasone (50-02-2)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\n English\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\n English\r\nPUI\r\n L639626516\r\nDOI\r\n 10.1038/s41409-022-01798-0\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41409-022-01798-0\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L639626516&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",{"entities":[[8,99,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[116,131,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[132,133,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[134,135,"REPORTERMIDDLENAME"],[279,303,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[305,309,"REPORTERCITY"],[311,317,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[422,428,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[455,465,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[476,536,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1088,1124,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[1903,1916,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[1917,1922,"PATIENTSEX"],[1943,1963,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1996,2029,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2036,2075,"DRUGDOSAGETEXT"],[2092,2108,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2111,2124,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2129,2140,"DRUGDOSAGETEXT"],[2145,2156,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2159,2171,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2379,2397,"TESTRESULT"],[2403,2422,"TESTRESULT"],[3179,3185,"TESTNAME"],[3325,3334,"TESTNAME"],[3810,3818,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[4752,4788,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[4790,4817,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[5370,5386,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[5683,5715,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"]]}]]}
