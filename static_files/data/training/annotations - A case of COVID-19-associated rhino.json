Her clinical condition worsened, and she ﬁnally died because of\nrespiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, and mucormycosis with invasion\ninto the orbit and probably the brain. According to DNA sequence analysis of\nthe fungus isolated from the patient, Apophysomyces variabilis was involved.\nThis is the ﬁrst published case of CAM and the third case of mucormycosis due\nto this mold.\nKEYWORDS\n\nmucormycosis, apophysomyces variabilis, COVID-19, immunocompetent patient,\ninvasive fungal infection, antifungal susceptibility testing\n\nIntroduction\nMucormycosis (zygomycosis) is a disease caused by an opportunistic infection in\nhumans and animals by members of the order Mucorales (Kwon-Chung, 2012; Binder\net al., 2014). Mucormycosis is subdivided into the rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous,\ngastrointestinal, and disseminated types according to the distribution of lesions (Roden et al.,\n2005; Skiada et al., 2011) and mainly occurs in immunosuppressed hosts, including those\nwith uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hematological malignancies, transplant recipients, and\npatients receiving corticosteroid therapy (Farmakiotis and Kontoyiannis, 2016).\n\nFrontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology\n\n01\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fErami et al.\n\n10.3389/fcimb.2022.898477\n\nreverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test using the\nLight Cycler 96-well system (Roche, Germany) for SARS-CoV-2\ntargeting N and RdRp genes (Pishtaz Teb, Tehran, Iran) (Fakhim\net al. 2021). The sample was positive with a cycle threshold value\nof 25, indicating ongoing viral infection. Cultures of urine and\nblood were unremarkable. A computed tomography (CT) scan of\nthe chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral mixed ground-glass\nopacity and consolidation, including central and peripheral\ndistribution, and bilateral pleural effusion (Figure 1A). The\npatient was started on remdesivir (100 mg), dexamethasone (8\nmg intravenously/twice daily and prednisolone (125 mg/day), and\nanticoagulants (heparin (QZD)). Because of increased hypoxia\nand progressive reduction in oxygen saturation (≈45%), the\npatient became severely ill and underwent mechanical\nventilation, and treatment with intravenous tocilizumab (8 mg/\nkg) was started. After 7 days of hospitalization, the patient\ndeveloped right-side periorbital edema, proptosis of the right\nglobe, necrosis of the hard palate, and nasal bleeding\n(Figures 1B, C). A paranasal and orbital CT scan demonstrated\nopaciﬁcation and an air-ﬂuid level in the bilateral sphenoid and\nethmoid sinuses and the right maxilla along with mucosal\nthickening in the left maxilla and fat haziness in the right extraand intraconal locations (Figures 1D, E). Samples from wounds,\ntissue necrosis, and bloody secretions of the eye were taken and\nsubjected to direct examination by microscopy using a potassium\nhydroxide preparation (Figure 2A), fungal culture, and\nhistopathology (Figure 2B). The condition was diagnosed as a\nprobable invasive mucormycosis. Intravenous liposomal\namphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day was initiated. However, the patient\nwas in an unstable condition; therefore, surgery and endoscopy of\nthe sinus tissues and debridement were not possible. Despite\nantifungal and antibacterial therapy, the patient’s situation\ndeteriorated, and the patient died on the evening of day 11 due\nto respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, and\nmucormycosis with involvement of the orbit and probably\nthe brain.\nThe clinical samples obtained using sterile swabs and cultured\non Sabouraud dextrose agar plates containing chloramphenicol\n(50 mg/L) (Biolife, Milan, Italy) yielded colonies of ﬂuffy, cottony\ngrowth that ﬁlled the plate within 4 days. The colony surface was\nwhite when young, becoming cream-to-yellow or brownish-gray\nlater on (Figure 3A). The reverse was white-to-pale yellow\n(Figure 3B). Microscopy of a slide prepared from the isolated\ncolony revealed non-septate and branched hyphae, long and\nunbranched sporangiophores, and pear-shaped sporangia.\nMoreover, disintegration might have left a small collar at the\nfoundation of the columella, and the sporangiospores were\nsmooth and generally elongated and may have appeared as pale\nbrown in mass (Figure 3C). Accurate morphologic identiﬁcation\nat the species level was not possible; therefore, the isolate was\nsubject to molecular identiﬁcation. DNA was extracted using\nphysical destruction of the cell wall by glass-bead manipulation\nfollowed by phenol–chloroform puriﬁcation as described\n\nThese infections have the capability of angio-invasion, inﬂicting\nvasculitis and thrombosis of vessels, which may result in massive\nareas of infarction and necrosis (Ibrahim et al., 2012). Regardless of\nits type, zygomycosis is an aggressive, life-threatening disease. As\nstated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), this is an infrequent illness with an infection\nrate of <1% worldwide and with a 50% mortality (Dannaoui and\nLackner, 2020); if left untreated, the mortality rate could be above\n90% (Divakar, 2021).\nMost severe cases of COVID-19 suffer from low oxygen\nlevels, high iron levels, a hyperglycemic state, acidosis, and\nlowered phagocytic activity. These conditions facilitate\nopportunistic fungal infections, such as mucormycosis (Singh\net al., 2021). Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in\nCOVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) cases, driven\nespecially by low- and middle-income countries and most\nextensively reported in India. The mortality rate varies\nbetween 14% and 70%, depending on the site of infection\n(Patel et al., 2020).\nEarly diagnosis and treatment are critical to reduce mortality\nin patients with zygomycosis (Binder et al., 2014). In addition,\nprecise species identiﬁcation of the fungus involved is critical, not\nonly to ensure accurate diagnosis but also for developing speciesspeciﬁc antifungal drugs, as well as to improve knowledge of the\nepidemiology of the disease. Various organisms have been\nimplicated as etiological agents of mucormycosis, most\ncommonly Rhizopus. Other etiological agents include Mucor,\nRhizomucor, Lichtheimia (previously known as Absidia),\nApophysomyces, Saksenaea, Cunninghamella, Syncephalastrum,\nand Cokeromyces (Gomes et al., 2011).\nHere, a fatal case of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis\n(ROCM) due to Apophysomyces variabilis in a 40-year-old\nwoman with COVID-19 is reported. To the authors’ knowledge,\nthis is the ﬁrst case of CAM caused by A. variabilis in Iran. To\nbetter understand the clinical characteristics of the cases of ROCM\ndue to non-Rhizopus Mucorales, we reviewed all published cases\nof ROCM that were supported by data from molecular\nspecies identiﬁcation.\n\nCase report\nOn 11 September 2021, a 40-year-old Afghan woman was\nhospitalized in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran, due to\nCOVID-19. She had a fever, dry cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis,\nmyalgia, and severe weakness, which had been ongoing for 5 days.\nPhysical examination revealed a body temperature of 38.7°C, a\nblood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths\nper minute, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on ambient air.\nLaboratory examination revealed leukopenia, lymphopenia, and a\nsigniﬁcant increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), and the patient\nunderwent oxygen supplementation therapy. Nasopharyngeal and\noropharyngeal swabs were obtained and subject to a real-time\n\nFrontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology\n\n02\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fErami et al.\n\n10.3389/fcimb.2022.898477\n\nFIGURE 1\n\n(A) Chest computed tomography (CT) scan with multifocal bilateral mixed ground-glass opacity and consolidation, including central and\nperipheral distribution, and bilateral pleural effusion.

Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as quality\ncontrol. AFST of the isolate against amphotericin B,\nﬂuconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and\nisavuconazole revealed minimum inhibitory concentration\n(MIC) values of 2, >64, 1, >16, 0.5, and 2 mg/ml, respectively,\n\npreviously (Aboutalebian et al., 2021). The internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) region was ampliﬁed using primer pairs ITS1\n(TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGC\nTTATTGATATGC) (Aboutalebian et al., 2020). PCR products\nwere puriﬁed and sequenced (Core Facilities Research Laboratory,\nIsfahan, Iran), and results were interpreted using NCBI BLAST\n(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) queries. The isolate was\nidentiﬁed as A. variabilis, with a 99.86% sequence identity to the\nreference sequence. The sequence has been submitted to GenBank\nunder the accession number OL804547.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\n(A) Direct microscopic examination using 10% potassium hydroxide revealed broad, aseptate hyaline hyphae with wide-angle branching.\n(B) Histopathologic examination with hematoxylin and eosin stain showing abundance in granulation tissue with foreign-body reaction and\nbroad, aseptate hyphae in the intravascular space with wide-angle branching.\n\nFrontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology\n\n03\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fErami et al.\n\n10.3389/fcimb.2022.898477\n\nFIGURE 3\n\n(A, B) Morphological characteristics of colonies on Sabouraud dextrose agar on the surface and the reverse after 4 days of incubation at 25°C.\n(C) Microscopic appearance of the isolate as observed on a slide prepared from the fungal culture.\n\nmango orchard in northern India, the genus Apophysomyces was\nﬁrst described in 1979 (Misra and Lata, 1979). Until 2010,\nApophysomyces elegans was regarded as the only member of this\ngenus; however, the phylogenetic studies over the following years\nhave revealed that Apophysomyces contains at least ﬁve species:\nA. elegans, A. variabilis, A. trapeziformis, A. mexicanus and\nA. ossiformis. Differences in apophysis and sporangiospores have\nbeen observed among the species (Alvarez et al., 2010). The variety\nof infections with Apophysomyces spp. is underappreciated, since\nthese fungi do not usually grow on the standard fungal culture\nmedia utilized in clinical laboratories. These fungi require a special\nnutrient-deﬁcient growth medium (e.g., Czapek agar), a high\ntemperature in comparison to other human pathogens (37°C–\n42°C), and prolonged incubation (7–10 days) (Padhye and Ajello,\n1988). In spite of their low virulence, Apophysomyces spp. are\npresently viewed as emerging pathogens amongst mucoralean\nfungi. Unlike other members of Mucorales that affect\nimmunocompromised hosts and those with uncontrolled\ndiabetes, A. variabilis mainly affects immunocompetent persons\nin the absence of underlying comorbidities (Ribes et al., 2000).\nRecent studies have shown that CAM may occur especially in\nimmunocompromised hosts (Pal et al., 2021). A number of risk\nfactors for CAM have been recognized, and some of these were\npresent in the current case. Our patient had a signiﬁcant increase\nin CRP (108 mg/L), and elevated CRP levels and extreme\nneutropenia are essentially associated with worse survival (Cho\net al., 2015). Gode et al. claimed that a CRP level >4 mg/dl would\nbe related to poor prognosis in patients with acute invasive fungal\nrhinosinusitis (Gode et al., 2015). Similarly, Cho et al. likewise\nfound that patients with a CRP level >5.5 mg/dl had worse\noutcomes (Cho et al., 2015). Twu et al. found that a\nCRP ≥1.025 mg/dl considerably accelerated the risk of\ndeveloping orbital complications in patients with invasive fungal\n\nand minimum effective concentration (MEC) for caspofungin\nwas >8 mg/ml. Written informed consent was obtained from the\nnext of kin of the patient for the publication of any potentially\nidentiﬁable images or data.\n\nDiscussion\nWe report the ﬁrst case of CAM caused by A. variabilis\noccurring in an apparently immunocompetent patient with\nsevere COVID-19, with fungal identiﬁcation obtained using\nsequencing of the ITS region of ribosomal DNA.\nMucormycosis is the third most common opportunistic\ninvasive fungal infection and is characterized by high morbidity\nand mortality in immunocompromised and immunocompetent\nhosts (Bouza et al., 2006; Kontoyiannis et al., 2012). It manifests\nwith a range of symptoms, such as rhino-orbito-cerebral, rhinoorbital, and pulmonary mucormycosis, which are caused by\naspiration of the spores. The infection is potentially\nangioinvasive; therefore, the resulting disease is characterized by\nsymptoms from vascular invasion and thrombosis, which lead to\nimpaired blood ﬂow and poor penetration of systemic antifungal\ntreatment. The disease affects mainly immunocompromised\nindividuals, including those with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,\nhematologic malignancies, and high levels of iron and those on\ntreatment with glucocorticoids. Mucormycosis can likewise\nappear as a cutaneous and subcutaneous illness in some trauma\npatients without known immunodeﬁciency.\nRhizopus is the genus most commonly involved in human\nmucormycosis, followed in frequency by Mucor and Lichtheimia,\ntogether representing 70%–80% of all cases of mucormycosis,\nwhereas Apophysomyces spp. account for less than 3% of the\ninfections (Gomes et al., 2011). Isolated from the environment of a\n\nFrontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology\n\n04\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fErami et al.\n\n10.3389/fcimb.2022.898477\n\notherwise healthy, and only ﬁve of 13 were diabetic or had\nother underlying systemic diseases. The average age was 44.5\nyears (range, 24–74 years). As seen in Table 1, all these patients\nhave been treated with liposomal amphotericin B or\namphotericin B. Of the reviewed patients with a rhino-orbitocerebral disease, six of 13 survived, and four died; for the\nremaining three patients, information was not available. Of the\nfour who died, three were previously healthy, and one had\ndiabetes (Table 1). Wolkow et al. reported a case of A.\nvariabilis infection resulting in rhino-orbito-cerebral disease in\nan immunocompetent 74-year-old woman. This patient\nexhibited diffuse calvarial lytic lesions and overlying soft-tissue\nnodules, but without parenchymal intracranial involvement.\nThere was radiographic and clinical evidence of infarction of\nthe orbital contents and cavernous sinus thrombosis. That\npatient was treated with amphotericin B, isavuconazole, and\nterbinaﬁne (Wolkow et al., 2017). Moreover, another case of A.\nvariabilis infection has been reported, but no patient\ninformation is available (Bala et al., 2015).\n\nrhinosinusitis (Twu et al., 2021). In addition, Mucorales require\niron to grow, and enhanced iron availability, including high\nferritin levels, is a risk factor for CAM (Jose et al., 2021). Our\npatient had high ferritin levels during the period of infection,\nconsequently precipitating the rapid growth of the fungus.\nHyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19 because of previous\ndiabetes mellitus, damage to beta cells in the pancreas by COVID19, corticosteroid therapy, and stress-related increased cortisol\nlevels with glucocorticoid therapy can damage phagocytic\nprocesses, failing to halt spore germination and growth and\nleading to CAM. Further endothelial damage and increased\nexpression of endothelial receptors have been observed in\npatients with COVID-19. Therefore, in our patient,\nglucocorticoid treatment, hyperglycemia and its complications,\nand dysfunction of innate immune cells due to high-dose\ncorticosteroid therapy and tocilizumab are probable contributors\nto the pathogenesis of CAM (Prakash et al., 2021).\nA. variabilis has most often been isolated in cases of\ncutaneous mucormycosis (Chander et al., 2018). Nevertheless,\na couple of cases of rhino-orbito-cerebral disease due to unusual\nMucorales species have been reported; however, this is a\ncondition that is probably underestimated due to difﬁculties in\nprecise species identiﬁcation in many laboratories. We reviewed\n13 cases, including our current case, of ROCM published in the\nperiod 2000–2021, that were supported by data from molecular\nspecies identiﬁcation. Eight of the 13 patients had been\n\nConclusions\nThis case alerts us to be more aware of opportunistic fungal\ninfections caused by rare species of Mucorales in hospitals.\nAlthough it may be a difﬁcult task, it is essential to be\n\nTABLE 1 Clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients with rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis caused by rare or unusual\nspecies of Mucorales.\n\nCase\nno.\n\nAge/ Geography\nsex\n\nUnderlying condition\n\nCausative agent Antifungal\nof\n\nOutcome and\ncomments\n\nReferences\n\n1\n\n59/M\n\nAustralia\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nApophysomyces\nelegans\n\nL-AmB\n\nCured\n\n(Fairley et al., 2000)\n\n2\n\n24/M\n\nColumbia\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nA. elegans\n\nL-AmB\n\nCured\n\n(Garcia-Covarrubias\net al., 2001)\n\n3\n\n50/M\n\nNA\n\nDiabetes mellitus, allergic rhinitis, and\nprevious sinusitis\n\nA. elegans\n\nL-AmB\n\nCured\n\n(Liang et al., 2006)\n\n4\n\n31/M\n\nIndia\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nA. elegans\n\nAmB\n\nDied\n\n(Schütz et al., 2006)\n\n5\n\n56/F\n\nIndia\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nSaksenaea vasiformis AmB\n\nDied\n\n(Baradkar et al., 2008)\n\n6\n\n40/M\n\nMalaysia\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nS. vasiformis\n\nAmB\n\nCured\n\n(Shatriah et al., 2012)\n\n7\n\n25/M\n\nIndia\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nA. elegans\n\nAmB\n\nCured\n\n(Parsi et al., 2013)\n\n8\n\nNA/M\n\nIndia\n\nDiabetic\n\nSyncephalastrum\nracemosum\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n(Mathuram et al., 2013)\n\n9\n\n45/F\n\nIndia\n\nDiabetic\n\nA. elegans\n\nL-AmB\n\nNA\n\n(Biswas et al., 2015)\n\n10\n\nNA\n\nIndia\n\nNA\n\nApophysomyces\nvariabilis\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n(Bala et al., 2015)\n\n11\n\n74/F\n\nUSA\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nA. variabilis\n\nL-AmB, ISC,\nTRF\n\nCured\n\n(Wolkow et al., 2017)\n\n12\n\n46/M\n\nMexico\n\nDiabetes\n\nA. ossiformis\n\nL-AmB\n\nDied\n\n(Martı́nez-Herrera\net al., 2020)\n\n13\n\n40/F\n\nIran\n\nImmunocompetent\n\nA. variabilis\n\nL-AmB\n\nDied\n\nThis study\n\nM, male; F, female; NA, not available; L-AmB, liposomal amphotericin B; AmB, amphotericin B; ISC, isavuconazole; TRF, terbinaﬁne.\n\nFrontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology\n\n05\n\nfrontiersin.org\n\n\fErami et al.\n\n10.3389/fcimb.2022.898477\n\nAll authors contributed to the article and approved the\nsubmitted version.\n\nconscious of the correct detection and identiﬁcation of\nmicroorganisms to improve the prophylaxis and therapeutic\ndecision and outcome and to reduce mortality.\n\nFunding\nData availability statement\nThis work was supported by Isfahan University of Medical\nSciences, Isfahan, Iran (grant number 1400180), which we\ngratefully acknowledge.
