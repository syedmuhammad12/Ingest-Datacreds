These reports arose shortly after publication of the RECOVERY trial4 and the widespread use of\r\nglucocorticoids in the treatment of Covid-19 pneumonia. Such infections typically involve either Candida or Aspergillus species,\r\nare generally limited to the lungs or bloodstream, and usually afflict those with severe Covid-19 pneumonia. Here we describe a\r\ncase of chronic C. glabrata and A. niger pneumonia, and reactive arthritis, in a patient who had a mild Covid-19 infection.A 73-\r\nyear-old male with a history of GOLD D chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous tobacco smoking, type II diabetes\r\nmellitus, and Covid-19 pneumonia 9 months prior presented to our pulmonary clinic complaining of a chronic non-productive\r\ncough and relapsing and remitting episodes of polyarticular arthralgia that had been present for the previous six months and\r\nserially treated with antibiotics. During the patient’s hospitalization 9 months prior, the patient was treated with dexamethasone\r\n6mg IV BID and supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. Review of the patient’s chart did not reveal any evidence of frequent\r\nCOPD exacerbations, or either hospital admission or outpatient treatment for any infectious diseases other than Covid-19, within\r\nthe last year. Initial laboratory studies in clinic revealed no evidence of any hematologic or biochemical abnormalities. Computed\r\nTomography of the patient’s thorax only revealed right lower lobe bronchial “debris” and emphysema. The patient underwent\r\nbronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the right lower lobe of the lung, with findings of C. glabrata and A. niger upon\r\nculture of the lavage fluid. Thereafter, the patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic, wherein treatment with a 3-month\r\ncourse of voriconazole was initiated. The patient symptoms resolved after 4 weeks of treatment.This case is significant because it\r\nrepresents an increasingly common pattern of opportunistic fungal infection after treatment for Covid-19 pneumonia. Interestingly,\r\nshort courses of low dose steroids have been associated with opportunistic fungal infections5, which may explain our patient’s\r\ninfection. This case also highlights what may be the first reported case of reactive arthritis secondary to opportunistic fungal\r\ninfection after treatment for Covid-19 pneumonia. The increasing ubiquity of glucocorticoid use in the treatment of Covid-19\r\npneumonia necessitates that clinicians be aware of the myriad of symptoms with which patients with opportunistic fungal\r\ninfections may present. This is especially true in patients without a history of severe Covid-19 infections.\r\nThis abstract is funded by: None\r\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2022;205:A5452\r\ntKirsch NE, Thorson T, Johnson WN, Kung M.
