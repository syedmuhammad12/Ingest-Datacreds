Clinicians treating patients\nwith COVID-­19 with corticosteroid therapy should be\nfamiliar with this condition to avoid delay in diagnosis.\nThe disease is associated with high mortality, and\nprompt diagnosis and management are essential for\nsalvaging patients. We report successful management\nof a patient who developed this complication following\nadministration of steroids for COVID-­19.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAmoebiasis is endemic in many developing countries. About 10% of patients become symptomatic\ndue to amoebic colitis, which is characterised by\nvarying degrees of diarrhoea, dysentery, abdominal pain and tenderness, and rarely, formation\nof an amoeboma, a tumour-­like mass of granulation tissue.1 2 Acute fulminant necrotising colitis\n(AFNC) is found in less than 0.5% cases, but carries\na mortality of 50%–100%.3 Corticosteroid therapy\nhas been found to be associated with AFNC.4\nHerein, we report the successful management of a\npatient who developed this condition after initiation of systemic steroids for severe COVID-­19.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\nBlood investigations were notable for raised\nhigh-­\nsensitivity C reactive protein (99 mg/L),\n6 (116.3 pg/mL) and lactate dehydrointerleukin-­\ngenase (723 U/L). Complete haemogram showed\nanaemia (haemoglobin 68 g/L) with leucocytosis\n(19.7×109/L). Liver function test revealed hypoalbuminaemia (16 mg/L). Kidney function test was\nnormal. Blood gas analysis showed mild metabolic\nacidosis.\nContrast-­enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed\npneumoperitoneum and multiple hypoenhancing\nliver lesions (likely abscesses) in segments IVa and\nVIII with associated thrombosis in the segmental\nportal venous branches. Another liver abscess was\nnoted in segment VI. The right-­sided colonic wall\nshowed thickening and hypoenhancement with\nsignificant surrounding fat stranding (figure 1).\nChest radiograph showed bilateral diffuse infiltrates. The CT severity score for COVID-­19 was\n20/25 (CORADS-­6).\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\n\nThe differential included bowel ischaemia due to\nvenous thrombosis in the ileocolic branch of superior mesenteric vein or an infective aetiology.\n\nTREATMENT\n\nCASE PRESENTATION\n\n© BMJ Publishing Group\nLimited 2021.

History\nof illness was unremarkable. On examination, his\noxygen saturation was 85% on 15 L/min oxygen\nsupplementation via non-­\nrebreathing mask. He\ntested positive for SARS-­CoV-­2 and was managed\nas per the institutional protocol for treatment of\nCOVID-­19.\nIn view of severe COVID-­19, he was started on\nintravenous dexamethasone 6 mg per day. Due to\nhigh supplemental oxygen requirement and ongoing\nlung fibrosis on CT, dexamethasone was continued\nfor 14 days, followed by oral prednisolone 40 mg\ndaily for 5 days. While recovering, on the 20th day\nof hospitalisation, he developed sudden, severe,\ndiffuse abdominal pain, associated with obstipation and abdominal distension, for which a surgical\nconsultation was sought.\nOn examination, the patient was afebrile, and\nhad a pulse rate of 122/min, blood pressure of\n112/74 mm Hg and respiratory rate of 22/min. On\nabdominal examination, diffuse tenderness with\nguarding in the right half of the abdomen was\nnoted.\n\nBroad-­\nspectrum intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin–tazobactam and metronidazole) were started.\nEmergency laparotomy was done through a midline\nincision under general anaesthesia. On exploration,\nabout 0.5 L of dirty peritoneal fluid and a phlegmon\nin the right subhepatic area were noted. On gentle\ndissection, the phlegmon revealed two abscesses in\nthe right lobe of the liver and three large perforations in the transverse colon ranging from 5 cm to\n8 cm in largest dimension. The necrosed areas of\nthe transverse colon were adherent to the two liver\nabscesses forming a phlegmon.\nRight hemicolectomy was done (figure 2). The\ndivided ends of terminal ileum and transverse colon\nwere exteriorised in the form of a double barrel\nstoma. Deroofing of the abscesses in segment IVa\nof liver was done.\nThorough peritoneal lavage with normal saline\nwas done and pelvic and subhepatic drains were\nplaced. During surgery, the patient required\ninotropic support and was shifted to the COVID-­19\nintensive care unit after surgery.\n\nOUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP\n\nInotropic support was tapered off gradually and\nthe patient was extubated on the first postoperative\n\nSaini R, et al.

A pigtail catheter was inserted into the liver\nabscess in segment VI under ultrasound guidance. The pelvic\ndrain was removed but the subhepatic drain was kept for a week\nas it was draining pus.\nThe patient developed surgical site infection, which was\ninitially superficial but later involved the fascia. On the 11th\npostoperative day, the patient had fascial dehiscence. Mesh\nlaparostomy was done, followed by negative pressure wound\ntherapy (NPWT). The pigtail catheter was removed on the 17th\npostoperative day.

Trophozoites of Entamoeba were\nidentified, more in the ulcer bed and the luminal aspect, with\nevidence of erythrophagocytosis. Biopsy from the wall of the\nliver abscess revealed extensive necrosis and few trophozoites of\nE. histolytica (figure 3).\nWith this histopathological diagnosis, treatment was modified\nto oral metronidazole 800 mg three times per day for 10 days,\nfollowed by diloxanide furoate 500 mg three times per day for\n10 days.2 The patient was discharged on postoperative day 32\nin stable condition. At 1-­month follow-­up, the patient was free\nof any gastrointestinal symptoms. Reversal of ileostomy was\nplanned after 4 weeks.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFigure 2 Specimen of right hemicolectomy showing three large\nperforations in the ascending colon.\n2\n\nAmoebiasis is common in India, found in about 15% of the population.5 This case report describes an uncommon presentation\nof amoebiasis shortly after corticosteroid therapy in a patient\nwith severe COVID-­19. AFNC is a potentially life-­threatening\nemergency. However, early diagnosis and intervention can lead\nto complete recovery, as seen in this patient.\nE. histolytica affects two main organ systems of the human\nbody—the gastrointestinal tract (with a predilection for the\ncaecum and the ascending colon) and the liver.6 In this patient,\nmultiple liver abscesses were present, in addition to AFNC.\nConcomitant liver abscess is found in about 53% of patients with\nAFNC.7\nSaini R, et al.

He was from a good socioeconomic background with access to safe drinking water and had no previous\nsymptoms suggestive of amoebiasis. In the absence of any other\npredisposing factor, AFNC in this patient may be attributed to\n19-­\nrelated corticosteroid therapy. During the SARS-­\nCOVID-­\nCoV-­\n2 pandemic, corticosteroids have been used extensively\nin the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-­19.8 Physicians\ntreating patients with COVID-­19 should be aware of this rare\ncomplication of amoebiasis, especially in endemic countries.\nAFNC is associated with high mortality and morbidity. In the\nlargest reported series to date, an overall mortality of 89% and\n30-­day operative mortality of 76% were observed. However,\nthe authors noted that survival rates improved after 1970,\nwhich they attributed to newer antibiotics and better intensive care. The authors identified longer duration of symptoms,\nnon-­surgical treatment and non-­resective procedures as factors\ncorrelating with mortality.7 Our patient survived despite a\nhistory of severe COVID-­19 and immunosuppressive therapy.\nSuccessful management of this patient could be attributed to\nearly diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention with resection\nof the involved bowel, stoma creation and early drainage of liver\n\nLearning points\n►► Acute fulminant necrotising colitis is a rare but potentially\n\nlethal complication of amoebiasis.\n\n►► Corticosteroid therapy can precipitate this condition in a\n\npreviously asymptomatic patient.\n\n►► Up to 100% mortality has been reported in the literature.\n►► Early diagnosis and prompt surgical management with\n\nresection of the involved bowel may be life-­saving.\n\n►► Physicians treating patients with COVID-­19 with\n\ncorticosteroid therapy should be aware of this lethal\ncomplication, especially in countries where amoebiasis is\nendemic.\n\nabscesses. Although the patient had significant wound-­related\nmorbidity, all complications were managed appropriately.
