Hospitalization complicated by agitation and pain prior to acute rehabilitation.\r\nUpon admission, patient was sedated and difficult to arouse secondary to\r\npolypharmacy; olanzapine 10 mg qAM, quetiapine 50 mg qAM and 100 mg qHS, valproic\r\nacid 750 mg BID, baclofen 10 mg TID, diazepam 5 mg QID and methadone 5mg TID.\r\nAntipsychotics were discontinued and alertness improved. However, patient\r\ndemonstrated decreased verbal output, oral intake, and psychomotor retardation during\r\ndiazepam taper. Diazepam 5 mg BID was cautiously reinitiated with subtle improvement.\r\nPsychiatry was consulted for possible catatonia and recommended lorazepam 1 mg IV\r\nchallenge. Setting: Acute rehabilitation Assessment/Results: A diagnosis of catatonia\r\nwas made given symptoms of mutism as well as staring, psychomotor retardation,\r\ndecreased oral intake, and cog-wheeling rigidity with immediate improvement after an\r\nIV lorazepam challenge. Catatonia was treated with 4 mg lorazepam PO QID.\r\nSubsequently, patient demonstrated significant cognitive and functional improvement.\r\nDiscussion (relevance): Anti-psychotics, anti-convulsants, anti-spasmodics, opioids, and\r\nbenzodiazepines may decrease consciousness and consequently inhibit neuro-recovery\r\nin brain injured patients. It is conventional practice to decrease or discontinue these\r\nclasses of medications as soon as possible during brain injury recovery. However, in\r\nthis case, use of benzodiazepines provided a paradoxical and essential stimulating\r\neffect. Conclusions: Catatonia is a rare consequence of brain injury and an under recognized manifestation as its clinical presentation may overlap with the primary brain\r\ninjury itself. However, this case addresses the importance of recognizing this unique\r\nentity. Use of benzodiazepines, in the appropriate population, has been supported and\r\nmay completely change the outcome of a brain injured patient. Furthermore,\r\nrecognizing catatonia as a potential sequela may prevent use of precipitating agents\r\nsuch as antipsychotics and aid in the diagnosis of rare conditions such as delayed post\r\nhypoxic leukoencephalopathy.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n benzodiazepine derivative\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\n anticonvulsive agent; baclofen; cocaine; diazepam; lorazepam; methadone;\r\nneuroleptic agent; olanzapine; opiate; quetiapine; valproic acid\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\n brain injury\r\nRecord downloaded - Wed 12 07 08:32:52 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\n adult; agitation; alertness; cardiopulmonary arrest; case report; catatonia; clinical\r\narticle; complication; conference abstract; consciousness; diagnosis; drug overdose;\r\ndrug therapy; ego development; female; hospitalization; human;\r\nleukoencephalopathy; mutism; outcome assessment; pain; polypharmacy;\r\nprevention; psychiatry; psychomotor retardation; rehabilitation; rigidity; vomiting\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\n baclofen (1134-47-0)\r\n cocaine (50-36-2, 53-21-4, 5937-29-1)\r\n diazepam (439-14-5)\r\n lorazepam (846-49-1, 110032-65-0, 91402-80-1)\r\n methadone (1095-90-5, 125-56-4, 23142-53-2, 297-88-1, 76-99-3)\r\n olanzapine (132539-06-1, 221373-09-7, 221373-18-8)\r\n opiate (53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4)\r\n quetiapine (111974-72-2, 111974-69-7)\r\n valproic acid (1069-66-5, 99-66-1)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\n English\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\n English\r\nPUI\r\n L639564061\r\nDOI\r\n 10.1002/pmrj.12913\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmrj.12913\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L639564061&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT United States of America\r\n Copyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nBui DH, Hussain AS, Chung MW.

This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United States of America and concerns a 25-year-old female patient who experienced a serious adverse reaction of difficult to arouse associated with olanzapine, quetiapine, valproic acid, baclofen, diazepam and methadone. The patient was found unconscious and covered with vomitus suffered an anoxic brain injury, likely due to cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to cocaine overdose. Hospitalization complicated by agitation and pain prior to acute rehabilitation. Upon admission, patient was sedated and difficult to arouse secondary to polypharmacy; olanzapine 10mg qAM, quetiapine 50mg qAM and 100mg qHS, valproic acid 750mg BID, baclofen 10mg TID, diazepam 5mg QID and methadone 5mg TID. Antipsychotics were discontinued and alertness improved. However, patient demonstrated decreased verbal output, oral intake, and psychomotor retardation during diazepam taper. Diazepam 5mg BID was cautiously reinitiated with subtle improvement.
