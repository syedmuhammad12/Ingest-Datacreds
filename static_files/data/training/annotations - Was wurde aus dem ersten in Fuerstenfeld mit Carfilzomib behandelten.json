November 2022\r\n\r\nPaid Advert\r\nThis article presents the case of a male patient who was first diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2012 and whose condition quickly became refractory to therapy. Deep remission was achieved with fourth-line therapy using the KRd regimen with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib available since 2015. Today, ten years after the initial diagnosis, the patient is doing very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n02/2012: A 56-year-old male patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in February of 2012. At the time of the diagnosis, a 30-40% infiltration of bone marrow obtained by iliac crest biopsy, elevated immunoglobulins (IgG: 3,707 mg/dl) and lambda FLCs (272 mg/l), as well as a total protein level of 9.3 mg/dl, albumin: 4.2 g/dl, ß2-microglobulin: 5.49 mg/l were observed. There was no osteolysis and the patient did not suffer from end organ damage; thus, stage I multiple myeloma according to Salmon and Durie, ISS stage II, was diagnosed. Due to lack of indication for treatment, monitoring was initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreexisting conditions: Secondary sclerosing cholangitis after several weeks of being hospitalized in the intensive care unit was a known comorbidity. In March of 2011, the patient had suffered from severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with an H1N1 swine flu infection. He had required a respirator and finally had to be placed on an ECMO machine. In addition, intermittent acute kidney failure requiring dialysis occurred in the context of this stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years later, progression - induction therapy\r\n02/2014: Two years later, the myeloma had progressed: Bone marrow infiltration was now at 60%, total protein: 12.7 g/dl, IgG: 5,132 mg/dl, marked increase in free light chains (lambda FLCs: 814 mg/dl); osteolysis was still not observed in imaging procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n03/2014: In March of 2014, induction therapy according to the PAD regimen (bortezomib, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone) was initiated over four cycles.\r\n\r\n\r\n06/2014: Bone marrow infiltration was still 60-70%, with the condition being largely unchanged serologically, as IgG had increased minimally in the meantime and increased again in August of 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the induction therapy\r\n07/2014: Thus, response to the induction therapy was lacking, and the patient, who was psychologically stressed, requested for the therapy to be paused. He also rejected stem cell apheresis in preparation of an autologous stem cell transplantation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond-line therapy\r\n08/2014 - 01/2015: After a brief pause, the patient was once again ready to continue treatment. Therapy with lenalidomide/dexamethasone was thus initiated; however, the patient complained of persistent fatigue. The response was minimal (M spike only minimally reduced from 4.74 g/dl to 3.17 g/dl, IgG reduced slightly from 6.121 mg/dl to 5.641 mg/dl); after the fifth cycle, bone marrow infiltration was 50% and was thus also only slightly reduced. Therapy was therefore discontinued in January of 2015. As early as two months later, the disease had once again progressed, as reflected by a compression fracture of T12, which required radiation therapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThird-line therapy\r\n04/2015 - 09/2015: The patient now received third-line therapy by means of four cycles of bortezomib/bendamustine/Aprednisolon, followed by two cycles of bortezomib/dexamethasone. The response was again minimal, with bone marrow infiltration decreasing to about 40% and IgG remaining at 4,973 mg/dl, as well as total protein at 10.4 g/dl.\r\n \r\nASCT planning — stem cell apheresis\r\nThe patient was now willing to undergo stem cell apheresis after all, so that cyclophosphamide priming was conducted in 10/2015. Unfortunately, only a few cells could be harvested, despite addition of plerixafor, and ASCT was therefore not an option.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth-line therapy\r\nCarfilzomib/Lenalidomide/Dexamethasone\r\n29. 12. 2015: As of December of 2015, carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was authorized and available for the treatment of relapsed/refractory myeloma, so that the patient was the first to be offered this option in our clinic.  Rapid response was observed; as early as after two cycles of KRd, the total protein decreased from 11.4 g/dl to 7 g/dl, the M spike decreased from 4.4 g/dl to 0.92 g/dl, consistent with partial remission. Bone marrow biopsy after four cycles only showed 10% residual infiltration of the bone marrow by the multiple myeloma. KRd was administered for a total of 12 cycles and was very well tolerated. The therapy was then discontinued per the patient’s wishes. During the entire therapy, first zoledronic acid and then XGEVA® since August 2018 were coadministered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSerum electrophoreses M spike.#1\r\nFindings date |\tFindings time\tService date\tService time\tValue\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n22.09.2016\t08:17:00\t27.09.2016\t11:47:51\t0.21\t \t\r\n12.07.2016\t09:03:07\t14.07.2016\t13:36:19\t0.22\t\t\r\n31.05.2016\t07:37:04\t02.06.2016\t11:26:04\t0.46\t\tCarfilzomib/Len/Dex\r\n07.03.2016\t08:22:14\t07.03.2016\t11:56:46\t0.92\t\r\n\r\n30.11.2015\t10:08:31\t03.12.2015\t10:52:49\t4.40\t \t\r\n17.09.2015\t10:00:10\t22.09.2015\t10:58:22\t2.56\t\t\r\n09.07.2015\t08:11:21\t09.07.2015\t13:41:14\t4.05\t \tBortezomib/Bendamustine/Aprednisolon\r\n06.03.2015\t07:37:14\t10.03.2015\t10:20:47\t3.78\t\tFracture of T12\r\n12.02.2015\t06:14:57\t12.02.2015\t11:28:14\t1.35\t \t\r\n05.02.2015\t13:51:10\t12.02.2015\t11:26:58\t3.83\t\tLenalidomide/Dexamethasone\r\n01.12.2014\t14:33:14\t03.12.2014\t14:52:32\t3.17\t\r\n\r\n28.08.2014\t07:38:26\t29.08.2014\t13:36:52\t4.74\t\t\r\n05.08.2014\t07:39:22\t07.08.2014\t11:37:59\t4.67\t \tAfter PAD\r\n03.06.2014\t07:28:55\t04.06.2014\t11:39:42\t2.78\t\t\r\n06.02.2013\t10:05:31\t07.02.2013\t11:27:56\t3.31\t\tInitiation of PAD\r\n18.01.2013\t06:24:08\t25.01.2013\t11:31:37\t3.34\t\t\r\n10.10.2012\t09:53:10\t16.10.2012\t14:38:18\t2.87\t\tInitial presentation\r\nRemission: VGPR in the fourth-line therapy\r\n\r\nFig.: M spike over time\r\n\r\nTen years after diagnosis and thus treatment-free for more than five years\r\nThe patient presented to the medical emergency room in March of this year - after a five year treatment-free period - due to a hypertensive crisis. As part of this follow-up visit, the myeloma-specific serological parameters were determined as well. The blood count and kidney function parameters were normal, calcium was within the reference range, total protein at 7.4 g/dl, the M spike was 1.8 g/dl, and osteolysis was still not observed in imaging procedures. Therapy is thus still not indicated, and we will continue to monitor. Should the need for treatment arise, a combination of an anti-CD38 antibody with carfilzomib and dexamethasone would be the initial approach.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary: Carfilzomib demonstrates excellent response, even in refractory myeloma. While KRd was only available as late-line therapy in 2015, current study data clearly support the use of carfilzomib combined with an anti-CD38 antibody in treating the first relapse. The patient has now been living with his disease for more than ten years, the last five of which were treatment-free. The lack of or only minor response to prior therapies is surely remarkable in this case. Carfilzomib was well tolerated over 12 cycles and, unlike the prior therapies, KRd was able to achieve deep remission for the first time. Side effects of carfilzomib are easily managed. Even preexisting cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, should not be an exclusion criterion for carfilzomib therapy. These patients can still be managed well by adjusting the dosage or dosing interval and optimizing drug therapy for hypertension and heart failure while monitoring them regularly.\r\n",{"entities":[[191,207,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[211,215,"PATIENTMEDICALSTARTDATE"],[507,518,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[519,523,"PATIENTSEX"],[688,712,"TESTNAME"],[736,742,"TESTNAME"],[779,792,"TESTNAME"],[807,814,"TESTNAME"],[826,842,"TESTNAME"],[1994,2004,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2016,2027,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2029,2042,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[2326,2371,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[3723,3739,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"]]}],["\r\nWhat became of the first patient treated with carfilzomib in Fürstenfeld?\r\n\r\n29.
