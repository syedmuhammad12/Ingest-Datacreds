An\nallergic reaction was suspected, and thus corticosteroids\nwere maintained with initial improvement. However, pruritus\npersisted, and the rash recurred on day 12 (Figure 1). The\nsame day, the result of stool culture was obtained, which\nwas notable for the presence of larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (Figure 2). His respiratory condition was still improving, and he denied gastrointestinal symptoms.\nThe patient was then diagnosed with Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome in the context of corticosteroid therapy. Blood cultures obtained on day 12 to rule out\nGram-negative bacteremia were negative. Corticosteroids\nwere stopped after 12 days of treatment, and ivermectin was\nprescribed. Symptoms resolved within 48 hours of treatment\nand ivermectin was continued for a total of 14 days.\nDiagnosis of strongyloidiasis is based on serology and\nstool testing.1 In stool agar plate culture, larvae in stool crawl\non the agar, spreading bacteria along their tracks, which\nthen grow in colonies creating patterns (Figure 3).\nStrongyloidiasis can be devastating in immunocompromised patients,2 and prompt treatment with ivermectin is\nsafe and effective.3 Screening is recommended in\n\n\f1135\n\nSTRONGYLOIDIASIS AND COVID-19\n\nEmergency Hospital, COVID-19, Spain, E-mail: laura.ngz@hotmail.\n\u0001n Comeche, Ramon y Cajal Hospital Tropical Medicine\ncom.
