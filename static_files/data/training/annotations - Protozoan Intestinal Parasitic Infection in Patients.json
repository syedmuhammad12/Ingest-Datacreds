Stool samples were collected from hematological malignancy patients (n = 50) hospitalized\r\nat the Department of Hematology and Transplantology of the Pomeranian Medical University in\r\nSzczecin. The control group consisted of 50 healthy participants. We used a direct smear examination\r\nand a commercial immunoenzymatic test. Intestinal protozoans were detected in 16% of patients\r\nwith hematological malignancies and in 6% of individuals in the control group. In stool samples from\r\npatients with HM, cysts of Giardia intestinalis (2%), oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. (10%), vacuolar\r\nforms of potentially pathogenic Blastocystis spp. (2%), and cysts of nonpathogenic Entamoeba coli\r\n(2%) were found. Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia intestinalis coproantigens were detected in 5 (10%)\r\nand 1 (2%) patients with HM, respectively. In three participants from the control group, vacuolar\r\nforms of Blastocystis spp. were found. In the patients with HM, a significantly higher prevalence\r\nof intestinal parasite infection was found in individuals working in the garden without protective\r\ngloves and those in contact with animals. In patients with hematological malignancies, intestinal\r\nparasites should be excluded, even during intensive chemotherapy treatment.\r\nKeywords: Blastocystis spp.; Cryptosporidium spp.; Entamoeba coli; Giardia intestinalis; hematological\r\nmalignancies\r\n1. Introduction\r\nHematological malignancies (HMs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases of diverse\r\nincidence, prognosis and etiology, characterized by an uncontrolled malignant proliferation\r\nof hematopoietic cells. According to recent data, HM are estimated to comprise\r\napproximately 6.5% of all cancers worldwide in 2012 [1]. TheWorld Health Organization\r\npredicts that the number of HM cases will increase by approximately 48% in less developed\r\ncountries in 2030 compared to 2012 [1].\r\nHematological malignancies and hemato-oncological treatments, such as chemotherapy,\r\nimmunotherapy, biological treatment and hematopoietic cell transplantation, are the\r\ncauses of secondary immunodeficiencies [2]. They can lead to decreases in humoral immunity,\r\ncellular immunity, complement abnormalities and neutropenia and impairment of\r\nnonspecific immunity, which significantly increase the risk of infection [3,4].\r\nAn increase in the risk of certain parasitic infections has also been found with a\r\nreduction in CD4 lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood of the host [5,6]. In addition,\r\nparasitosis in immunocompromised patients can lead to opportunistic diseases with severe\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11102847 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 2 of 13\r\nsymptoms [5–7]. Opportunistic infections may be associated with reinvasion, polyinfection,\r\npredisposition to autoinfection and a high risk of the parasite acquiring highly pathogenic\r\ncharacteristics [8]. The most common parasites in such patients are Giardia intestinalis\r\nand intestinal coccidia (i.e., Cryptosporidium spp., Isospora belli and Cyclospora cayetanensis).\r\nIn recent years, Blastocystis spp. and Microsporidia spp. have been reported as emerging\r\npathogens in immunocompromised hosts [9]. Strongyloides stercoralis is frequently found\r\nin patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection, a virus associated with\r\nadult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma [10].\r\nIn our previous research, we noted respiratory failure associated with ascariasis in\r\npatient with AML (acute myeloid leukemia) [7]. Some authors observed a higher prevalence\r\nof Blastocystis spp. and Giardia intestinalis infection in patients with acute lymphoblastic\r\nleukemia (ALL) [11].\r\nMost studies on the prevalence of intestinal parasite in patients with HM were\r\nconducted in tropical countries, with a prevalence rate from 12% in patients receiving\r\nchemotherapy for HMin Turkey to 69.5% in pediatric patients with hematologic neoplasms\r\nin Mexico [12–17].\r\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of gastrointestinal protozoan\r\ninfection during intensive hemato-oncological treatment of hematological malignancies.\r\nMoreover, in order to determine the influence of biological factors on the prevalence of\r\nparasites, our study included factors such as age, gender, hematopoietic cell transplantation\r\nas well as the presence of intestinal symptoms, and risk factors, such as the consumption\r\nof unwashed fruits and vegetables, contact with animals and soil and previous travel to\r\ntropical countries. We also analyzed the association between the prevalence of intestinal\r\nparasites and the type of hematopoietic malignancy.\r\n2. Materials and Methods\r\nThe study was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Pomeranian Medical\r\nUniversity (PUM) in Szczecin (KB-0012/54/17). It conformed to the principles outlined in\r\nthe Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2008.\r\n2.1. Characteristics of the Groups\r\nStool samples were collected from hematological malignancy patients (n = 50) hospitalized\r\nin 2017–2018 at the Department of Hematology and Transplantology PUM. The\r\nHM group consisted of 17 women (34%) and 33 men (66%). The mean age of these patients\r\nwas 59.4 \u0006 14.7 years (61.8 \u0006 11.9 years for women and 58.1 \u0006 16.0 years for men). The\r\nHM group consisted of patients diagnosed with malignancies such as acute myeloblastic\r\nleukemia (AML; 30%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; 22%), plasma cell myeloma\r\n(PCM; 8%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 6%), myelodysplastic syndrome (MS; 6%),\r\nBurkitt’s lymphoma (BL; 4%) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN;\r\n4%). Patients in the HM group received intensive hemato-oncological treatment, and 43\r\n(86%) patients additionally received steroid therapy. Subjects who had taken antidiarrhea\r\ncompounds, barium, bismuth or mineral oil (\u00143 weeks) were excluded. The control group\r\n(CG) consisted of 50 healthy subjects (28 women—56%; 22 men—44%). The mean age of\r\nthe CG patients was 50.94 (51.4 \u0006 22 years for women; 49.4 \u0006 21 years for men).\r\nThe individuals from the HM and CG groups were divided into four age groups: ages\r\n20–40 (A1; n = 6 and n = 21); 41–60 (A2; n = 14 and n = 10); 61–80 (A3; n = 28 and n = 17);\r\n>80 (A4; n = 2 and n = 2). Immunocompetent individuals had no gastrointestinal symptoms\r\nand went to the Laboratory of the Department of Biology and Medical Parasitology PUM\r\n(LDBMP) for a standard stool parasitological examination. Exclusion criteria for the CG\r\nincluded the presence of chronic and neoplastic diseases, chemotherapy, and the use of\r\nimmunosuppressive drugs.\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 3 of 13\r\n2.2. Collection of Stool for Testing\r\nBefore stool collection, patients had to give their consent for the study and were\r\ninformed about the rules of stool collection and transportation. Stool from all of the\r\npatients were collected in a special disposable container, and in cases where the stool was\r\ncollected from a hemato-oncological patient, the procedure was conducted under the control\r\nof medical staff. Patients completed a questionnaire about their eating habits, hygiene\r\nhabits, contact with animals and travel history. Additionally, HM patients completed a\r\nquestionnaire about their disease, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, chemotherapy,\r\ntransplantation history and coexisting chronic diseases.\r\n2.3. Parasitological Stool Examination\r\nStool samples were examined immediately upon arrival at the parasitology laboratory.\r\nMacroscopic examination determined stool consistency (i.e., watery, loose or firm) and,\r\nadditionally, assessed the presence of mucus, blood, adult worms and proglottids. A direct\r\npreparation in normal saline (0.9%), and Lugol’s iodine solution (diluted in 1:5 distilled\r\nwater) was made from each test sample (~2 g stool). Moreover, stool samples were stained\r\nby modified Ziehl–Neelsen staining. Slides were examined at 1000\u0002 magnification under a\r\nlight microscope to investigate the oocyst of Cryptosporidium spp.\r\nDevelopmental forms of intestinal parasites, including cysts and trophozoites of\r\nprotozoa, eggs, larvae and mature forms of worms, were sought in the feces.\r\nOther structures indicative of pathology were also sought in the feces including\r\nmacrophages, red blood cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), Charcot–Leyden\r\ncrystals, starch grains, meat fibers and fat globules.\r\nStool samples were also analyzed to determine the presence or absence of Cryptosporidium\r\nspp. coproantigen using a commercial immunoenzymatic test (ProSpecT Cryptosporidium\r\nMicroplate Assay), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The test uses\r\nmonoclonal antibodies for the qualitative detection of Cryptosporidium-specific antigen\r\n(CSA), which reduces the possibility of cross-reactivity. It has a sensitivity of 97% and a\r\nspecificity of 100%. The intensity of the reaction product was analyzed visually.\r\nFecal samples were examined to determine the presence or absence of G. intestinalis\r\ncoproantigen using an immunoenzymatic test (Thermo Scientific™ ProSpecT™ Giardia\r\nMicroplate Assay), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The test uses a monoclonal\r\nantibody for the qualitative detection of Giardia-specific antigen (GSA 65). It has a sensitivity\r\nof 96% and a specificity of 98%. The intensity of the reaction product was analyzed visually.\r\n2.4. Statistical Analysis\r\nStatSoft Statistica v11.0 and Microsoft Excel 2007 were used for statistical analysis. The\r\nnonparametric Mann–Whitney U test (p < 0.05) was used for comparisons between study\r\ngroups. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rs) was calculated, and its significance was\r\ndetermined to evaluate the relationship between the frequency of infection in patients with\r\nintestinal parasites and the age and sex of patients, as well as the co-occurrence of clinical\r\nsymptoms. The environmental exposure of the HM and CG patients was also analyzed.\r\n3. Results\r\nThe presence of intestinal protozoan was detected in eight (16%) patients with HM\r\nand in three (6%) individuals in the control group (Table 1). In patients with HM, the\r\nprevalence of intestinal parasites was significantly higher than for participants in the CG\r\n(p < 0.05). The highest occurrence of protozoan parasites (4%) was noted in patients with\r\nPCM and DLBCL.\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 4 of 13\r\nTable 1.

The three infected patients from the CG had vacuolar\r\nforms of Blastocystis spp. (<5 parasites per high-power field). The presence of undigested\r\nstarch grains was noted in four immunocompetent patients (10.3%), and the presence\r\nof Charcot–Leyden crystals in the stool was noted in one patient (2.6%). In eight (16%)\r\npatients with HM, the parasitological stool contained undigested starch.

Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 5 of 13\r\n3.1. Clinical Cases\r\nCryptosporidium spp. were found in a 66 year old female patient with plasma cell\r\nmyeloma, who initially presented with a predominant IgG lambda. The patient also\r\nhad hypertension, diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease and was treated with\r\nhemodialysis. Laboratory tests revealed normocytic anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia\r\nand high creatinine levels. The patient qualified for treatment with Velcade (bortezomib)\r\nand dexamethasone. She worked as a farmer with a history of working in the garden\r\nwithout protective gloves and had contact with animals including a dog and cat.\r\nCryptosporidium spp. was also found in a 46 year old patient diagnosed with DLBCL.\r\nThe patient underwent a rectal swab and stool collection for Clostridium difficile infection,\r\nand the results were negative. The patient reported a history of gardening without protective\r\ngloves and had contact with animals including a dog. Cryptosporidium spp. infection\r\nwas found in a 61 year old patient diagnosed with AML, following a surgery for clear\r\ncell renal cell carcinoma, suffering from gallbladder stones and hypertension. The patient\r\nwas treated with intensive chemotherapy according to the protocol of the Polish Adults\r\nLeukemia Group (PALG). He had a history of working in the garden without protective\r\ngloves and had contact with animals including a dog and pigeons.\r\nCryptosporidium spp. were also found in a 65 year old IgG-kappa multiple myeloma\r\nfemale patient treated with broadspectrum antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. During\r\nhospitalization, the patient remained in serious general condition. The patient had gastrointestinal\r\nbleeding and blood was found during the stool examination. Gastroscopy revealed\r\ninflammation of the gastric mucosa and polyps. The patient was undergoing chemotherapy\r\nand was treated with corticosteroids. She did not have a history of gardening without\r\nprotective gloves and had no contact with animals.\r\nA 45 year old male patient had an established diagnosis of BL, a history of chemotherapy\r\nand radiotherapy for high-grade lymphoma, a left palate and eyeball prosthesis due to\r\nthe complications from radiotherapy, postoperative treatment for squamous cell carcinoma\r\nof the skin in the region of the buttocks and treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy\r\n(cART) for HIV. CD4+ T-cell count was below 200 cells/\u0016L. The patient had lived in Africa\r\nfor many years and traveled professionally. The patient had experienced three episodes\r\nof malaria. Due to the diagnosis of BL, he qualified for an intense chemotherapy regimen\r\ncomprising fractionated cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone\r\nto which rituximab was added (R-HyperCVAD). CART therapy for the acquired immunodeficiency\r\nwas conducted under the supervision of the outpatient clinic with good results.\r\nThe patient was diagnosed with Cryptosporidium spp. coproantigen and Cryptosporidium\r\noocysts during immunochemotherapy.\r\nGiardia intestinalis cysts and G. intestinalis antigen were detected in a 61 year old patient\r\nwith relapsed DLBCL lymphoma treated with German Multicenter Adult ALL Study Group\r\n(GMALL) chemotherapy. Oral stomatitis was observed after methotrexate treatment. The\r\npatient worked as an automotive refinisher. With a history of diagnosed pinworm, he\r\nreported working in the garden without protective gloves and had contact with dogs.\r\nA single Blastocystis spp. was observed in the stool of a 61 year old patient with\r\nALL. She was a patient after a hemicolectomy for sigmoid carcinoma with subsequent\r\nchemotherapy with a genetic load for colorectal cancer. In addition to the stool parasitological\r\nexamination, a stool microbiological examination was performed, which showed\r\nthe presence of gastrointestinal physiological flora with Escherichia coli ESBL. The patient\r\nwas treated with intensive chemotherapy according to the protocol of the PALG (ALL6\r\nPALG >55 years of age) consolidation treatment with methotrexate and dexamethasone.\r\nThe patient reported a history of gardening without protective gloves and had contact with\r\nanimals including a cat and a dog.\r\nA 62 year old patient diagnosed with MPN, a welder by occupation, was found to have\r\nEntamoeba coli cysts. The patient was treated with hydroxycarbamide and corticosteroids.\r\nThe patient reported a history of working in the garden without protective gloves and had\r\ncontact with animals including a dog.\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 6 of 13\r\nPatients with parasites and coproantigens were treated with nitrosoxanide. After\r\n2 weeks, the follow-up stool test showed all samples were negative.\r\n3.2. Biological Factors and Parasite Infection\r\nWe found no statistically proven relationship between the occurrence of enteric parasites\r\nand the gender of the patient. The prevalence of parasites in male (M) and female (F)\r\npatients from the HM group were ~4 and 3 times higher (M: 15.2%, 17.7%) than in the CG\r\n(M: 5.9%, 4.6%), respectively.\r\nIn immunocompetent subjects, the highest prevalence of protozoan parasites was\r\nreported in the A1 group and did not exceed 10%. The highest prevalence of intestinal\r\nparasite infection in patients undergoing hemato-oncological treatment was found in the\r\nage categories A3 and A2 at 22.2% and 13.3%, respectively. The presence of intestinal\r\nparasites in the HM group and the CG was not significantly related to age. There was no\r\nsignificant correlation between the consumption of unwashed fruits and/or vegetables, the\r\nconsumption of unboiled water, raw meats and seafood and the prevalence of intestinal\r\nparasites in patients from the HM group or the CG (Table 2).\r\nTable 2. The prevalence of intestinal parasites (%) in the HM and CG groups according to environmental\r\nrisk factors.\r\nHM (n = 50) CG (n = 50)\r\nInfected (n = 8) Uninfected (n = 42) Infected (n = 3) Uninfected (n = 47)\r\nDrinking tap water\r\nYes 25.0 23.8 0 17.95\r\nNo 75.0 76.2 100 82.05\r\nEating unwashed fruits and vegetables\r\nYes 37.5 33.3 0 28.21\r\nNo 62.5 66.7 100 71.79\r\nEating raw meat, sea food and fish\r\nYes 37.5 31.0 0 43.59\r\nNo 62.5 69.0 100 56.41\r\nGardening without gloves\r\nYes 87.5 * 54.8 33.3 20.51\r\nNo 12.5 * 45.2 66.7 79.49\r\nContact with domestic and wild animals\r\nYes 75.0 * 54.8 100 56.41\r\nNo 25.5 * 45.2 0 43.59\r\nTravel history\r\nYes 25.0 16.7 0 42.6\r\nNo 75.0 83.3 100 57.4\r\n* p < 0.05 for the significance of the difference vs. the control (Mann–Whitney U test).\r\nThe comparative analysis of patients with HM showed a significantly higher prevalence\r\nof intestinal parasite infections in those who worked in the garden without protective\r\ngloves (87.5%) compared to those who protected their hands (12.5%) (U = 12; p < 0.05).\r\nMoreover, it was shown that hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with HM had\r\nno effect on the presence of intestinal parasites.\r\nIn the HM group, we noted a significantly higher prevalence of intestinal parasite\r\ninfections in patients with animal contact (75%) than in patients without animal contact\r\n(25.5%) (U = 10; p < 0.05). Infected patients with HM most frequently declared contact with\r\ndogs and cats and much less frequently with pigeons, pigs, rabbits and also with birds\r\nincluding hens and/or parrots.\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 7 of 13\r\nThe occurrence of intestinal parasites was not significantly related to travel history.\r\nIn immunocompromised patients traveling to a different climate zone within the last\r\ntwo years, 16% of patients had travelled outside of Poland to Greece, Israel, Turkey, Malta,\r\nand North and East Africa including Egypt, Tunisia and Kenya. Two patients (25%) with\r\na positive travel history had intestinal parasites. A direct stool smear from a 66 year old\r\nmale, who had travelled to Israel, detected Blastocystis spp. In addition, a Cryptosporidium\r\nspp. coproantigen was found in a 61 year old patient with BL who declared a trip to Kenya\r\ntwo months before the parasitological examination was performed.\r\nThere was no statistically significant correlation between the presence of clinical symptoms\r\nand parasitic infections between the groups. In patients with HM, the most common\r\nsymptoms reported were weakness (72%), weight loss (66%) and loss of appetite (56%).\r\nLess commonly reported were diarrhea (38%), skin flushing (30%), vomiting (22%), constipation\r\n(22%) and difficulty breathing (22%). In patients who were found to have parasites,\r\nthe co-occurrence of the following symptoms was reported: weight loss and weakness\r\n(75%); weight loss and a loss of appetite (62.5%). Less frequently, skin redness (37.5%),\r\ndiarrhea (25%) and constipation (25%) were reported. No gastrointestinal symptoms were\r\nobserved in control patients with confirmed Blastocystis spp.\r\n4. Discussion\r\nThe clinical severity and outcome of a parasitic disease often depends on innate and\r\nacquired host immunity [18]. Secondary immunodeficiency (SID) has a mixed nature\r\nand involves both specific and nonspecific responses. In hematological malignancies,\r\nsymptoms of immune deficiency increase due to, among other things, the displacement\r\nof normal immune cells by tumor cells, the secretion of immunosuppressive factors and\r\nimmunosuppressive treatment [2]. These host conditions facilitate infection by enteric\r\nparasites, among others [5].\r\nIn patients with HM, we observed that the prevalence of intestinal parasites was\r\nsignificantly higher than in the immunocompetent group. Enteric parasites (most frequently\r\nCryptosporidium spp.) were noted in patients undergoing hemato-oncological treatment for\r\nPMC, DLBCL, ALL, AML and BL. Stark et al. [19] stated that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\r\n(NHL), leukemia and lymphoproliferative disease may be risk factors for cryptosporidiosis.\r\nBotero et al. [6] demonstrated that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in patients with\r\nAML and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) did not exceed 4%—moreover, the authors\r\ndid not find any association between the occurrence of intestinal parasites and the type\r\nof immunodeficiency. On the other hand, Bednarska et al. [5] observed a link between\r\nmicropathogen infections, including Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Blastocystis spp.,\r\nmicrosporidia and immunosuppressed rates. Most parasitic infections were reported in\r\npatients with severe second-stage immunodeficiency (6.1%), and in patients with mild or\r\nno immunosuppression, it was 0.6% and 2.2%. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in\r\nthe HM patients in this study was similar to the results obtained by Jeske et al.

[15] showed that during intensive chemotherapy, patients with HM\r\nhave a prevalence of intestinal parasites that can be arranged in the following descending series:\r\nALL < AML < PCM and lymphoma ~69%; ~55%; ~47%, respectively. Ta¸sova et al. [26]\r\ndetected parasitic infections in ~27% of hematology patients undergoing chemotherapy\r\nwith neutropenia. In hemato-oncological patients, Blastocystis spp. and E. coli were reported\r\nin ~13% and 1.5%, respectively. The presence of Blastocystis spp. was most commonly\r\nconfirmed in patients with AML, ALL, CML, CLL and NHL, while E. coli was noted in\r\npatients with AML, ALL and CML.\r\nPatients with marked T-cell deficiencies do not exhibit increased susceptibility to\r\ngiardiasis [18]. Some authors observed that the weighted prevalence of G. intestinalis\r\nin patients with cancer did not exceed 7% [26]. In this study, we found G. intestinalis\r\ncysts and confirmed coproantigen in a patient with DLBCL, but this parasite was not a\r\ncommon opportunistic infection in patients with cancer or cancer chemotherapy-induced\r\nimmunosuppression, suggesting that not all forms of immunosuppression predispose to\r\nthe infection [18]. Mahdavi et al. [37] demonstrated that the immunodeficiency status of\r\ncancer patients is a possible risk factor for acquiring Giardia infection, and they observed\r\nthat the weighted prevalence of giardiasis was higher among patients suffering from HMs\r\ncompared with colorectal patients as well as those individuals with mixed cancers.\r\nReduced immunity in HM patients is manifested clinically by chronic and increasing\r\ninfections or, less commonly, autoimmunity. The course of opportunistic parasitic infection\r\nmay be atypical, severe, prolonged and with resistance to antibiotic therapy [8]. It has been\r\nreported that patients undergoing hemato-oncological treatment report gastrointestinal\r\nsymptoms [4]. Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms occurring during parasitic infections\r\nare similar to symptoms after chemotherapy and include weight loss, loss of appetite and\r\ndiarrhea. This may lead to misdiagnosis. In this study, there was no association between the\r\npresence of parasites and intestinal symptoms. Some authors suggest that, during hematological\r\ntherapy, patients do not report gastric symptoms due to the immunosuppression\r\nwhich delays the inflammatory response [15]. Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting and\r\nnausea have been reported in hemato-oncological patients with blastocystosis. Although\r\nsome Blastocystis spp. infections indicate the pathogenic nature of this protozoan, usually\r\nthey are asymptomatic [15]. Tan [38] observed that a large number of parasites in the\r\nintestine (>5 parasites per high-power field) entails gastrointestinal symptoms. In this\r\nstudy, all those infected with Blastocystis spp. from the HM group and the CG had less than\r\nfive vacuolar forms per high-power field.\r\nIt has been shown that Blastocystis spp. can induce the process of caspase-dependent\r\napoptosis without changes in the intestinal epithelium of rats, while at the same time\r\nmaintaining its correct functioning and the impermeability of the barrier [39]. Kumarasamy\r\net al. [40] suggested that Blastocystis hominis should be considered an opportunistic parasite,\r\ne.g., when the parasite is confirmed in colorectal cancer during chemotherapy.\r\nCryptosporidiumspp. is one of themajor causes of diarrhea inHIV-positive patients [5,41].\r\nInfection in immunocompetent patients is either asymptomatic or presents with profuse\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 10 of 13\r\nacute or persistent watery diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, stomach cramps and occasionally\r\na fever that lasts approximately two weeks. Full-blown invasive infections, which include\r\nsevere diarrhea (12–17 L per day), gastrointestinal symptoms and weight loss, occur\r\nin patients with severely low immunity and can lead to death in HIV-positive patients.\r\nIn this group of patients, chronic Cryptosporidium spp. infection did not develop until\r\nT-lymphocyte (CD4) counts were maintained at >180 cells/mL, and 87% of HIV-positive\r\npatients with lower lymphocyte counts developed a full-blown chronic infection [42]. We\r\nfound Cryptosporidium spp. in a patient with HIV and BL during immunochemotherapy.\r\nGastrointestinal parasites were found to be more prevalent in patients with gastrointestinal\r\ncancer than in patients with hematological malignancies, lung cancer and/or breast\r\ncancer [43]. Some researchers have suggested that the chronic presence of Cryptosporidium spp.\r\nin the gastrointestinal tract of the host can induce pathological changes of an adenocarcinomalike\r\nnature. Furthermore, it has been reported that, at low infestation, this opportunistic\r\nprotozoan can induce gastrointestinal neoplasia [44]. SCID mice were infected with\r\nthe Cryptosporidium strain isolated from patients with lymphoblastic leukemia after bone\r\nmarrow transplantation in an experimental model. Symptomatic cryptosporidiosis and\r\nneoplasm in the stomach, intestine and biliary tract were observed in the animals, and\r\nthe presence of Cryptosporidium spp. was noted in the range of neoplastic lesions [42].\r\nCryptosporidium spp. leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), known\r\nto induce anti-apoptotic mechanisms and also to transmit oncogenic signals to epithelial\r\ncells [42]. Sul ˙ zyc-Bielicka et al. [32] reported no significant association between\r\nCryptosporidium spp. infection and the tumor grade according to the Astler-Coller scale, but\r\nCryptosporidium coproantigen was significantly more prevalent in patients with colorectal\r\ncancer before oncological treatment than in a control group without malignant changes. In\r\nthe two hemato-oncological patients in this study, Cryptosporidium spp. and Blastocystis spp.\r\nwere found to co-occur with sigmoid tumors and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\r\nChemotherapies other than corticosteroids appear to predispose patients towards\r\nparasitic infections more than any other form of anticancer treatment. Cryptosporidiosis has\r\nbeen reported in cases of acute leukemia and as a complication of cancer chemotherapy [16].\r\nIn this study, we observed cryptosporidiosis in patients treated with chemotherapeutic\r\nagent immunosuppressive drugs (dexamethasone) and aggressive immunochemotherapies:\r\nGMALL, PALG and Rhyper-CVAD. Ta¸sova et al. [26] suggested that in patients with HM\r\nand intestinal symptoms, Blastocystis spp. should be excluded even during intensive\r\nchemotherapy treatment, as was confirmed by a patient with ALL in our study, in whom\r\nblastocystosis was noted after the first cycle of PALG ALL6 consolidation treatment with\r\nmethotrexate and dexamethasone.\r\nIn immunocompromised patients, mainly with HIV infection, several studies investigated\r\nthe specific risk factors for this high-risk group and found that drinking tap water\r\nfrom an untreated supply, exposure to animals, unsafe sexual activity and the use of public\r\ntoilets are associated with Cryptosporidium spp. infection. The infection is spread from\r\nperson to person, from animals, via food and by water [45–47]. In patients with HM,\r\nthe risk factors affecting the occurrence of enteric parasites we found included working\r\nin the garden without protective gloves and contact with animals, as was confirmed by\r\nIzadi et al. [47]. Gedle et al. [48] in patients with HIV/AIDS from Ethiopia showed that\r\ncontact with animals, drinking tap water, malnutrition and low number of CD4 T cells are\r\npredisposing factors to parasitic diseases in patients with low immunity. Similarly, Jeske\r\net al. [20] showed a relationship between dog and cat ownership and the frequency of\r\nintestinal parasitosis, especially giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis. Kindie and Bekele [46]\r\nreported no association with diet (e.g., eating unwashed fruits, vegetables and meat) and\r\nthe presence of enteric parasites in patients with immune deficiency, which was consistent\r\nwith this study.\r\nIn our study, we did not find any correlation between intestinal parasites and travel\r\nhistory, but two patients, who declared a trip to Israel and Kenya (before hospitalization),\r\nhad protozoan parasites. Cancer patients are at higher risk of infections during\r\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 2847 11 of 13\r\nneutropenia after chemotherapy, and most patients should be discouraged from traveling\r\nduring that period [49]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as\r\nmentioned by Mikati et al. [50], travelers are considered immunocompromised for three\r\nmonths after their last aggressive treatment. An extended diagnosis of any cases of chronic\r\ndiarrhea after a return from intertropical and subtropical countries is encouraged, especially\r\nin immunocompromised HIV-positive patients, among others, and patients undergoing\r\nhemato-oncological treatment [28,51].\r\n5. Conclusions\r\nChemotherapy in patients with hematological malignancies, mainly those with plasma\r\ncell myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, results in an increased risk of intestinal\r\nparasitic infections including opportunistic infections. A number of environmental factors,\r\nincluding pet ownership and contact with soil while gardening without gloves, seem to\r\nincrease the risk of intestinal parasitosis in patients with hematological malignancies. In our\r\nstudy, we confirmed the infection of Giardia intestinalis and Blastocystis spp. in HM patients.\r\nIt is possible that, similar to Cryptosporidium spp., these parasites act as opportunistic\r\npathogens in patients undergoing chemotherapy, but this is still an issue that requires\r\nfurther comprehensive research.\r\nEvery disturbance of the immune system (e.g., immunosuppression, chemotherapy\r\nand HIV) has an influence on the course of the infection; thus, parasitological examination\r\nof stools of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, also during treatment with\r\nchemotherapeutics, is advisable.\r\nAuthor Contributions: The following represents the substantial contributions of individual authors:\r\nConceptualization, N.Ł.-A. and A.Ł.; methodology, N.Ł.-A. and A.Ł.; performing the experiments,\r\nN.Ł.-A., A.Ł. and D.W.; analyzing the data, N.Ł.-A., A.Ł. and D.W.; writing the manuscript, N.Ł.-A.,\r\nA.Ł. and D.K.-B.; providing scientific supervision of manuscript, D.K.-B. and B.Z.
