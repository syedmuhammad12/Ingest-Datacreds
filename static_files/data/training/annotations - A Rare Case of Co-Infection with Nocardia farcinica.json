This patient did not respond well to a meropenem-based regimen, and the number of\nlesions was significantly reduced after switching to imipenem. The patient’s trough concentration was insufficient when using\nconventional doses of voriconazole for the treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis. After adding omeprazole, the concentration reached\nstandard levels and symptoms improved. The patient eventually made a full recovery.\nKeywords: Aspergillus fumigatus, interaction, intracranial infection, Nocardia farcinica, Pneumocystis jirovecii, voriconazole\n\nPlain Language Summary\n● Nocardia farcinica, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Aspergillus fumigatus are opportunistic pathogens, and co-infection of these\n\nthree species is very rare.\n● We report a case of co-infection with Nocardia farcinica, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Aspergillus fumigatus in an immunosup­\n\npressed patient.\n● This patient did not respond well to a meropenem-based regimen, and the number of lesions was significantly reduced after\n\nswitching to imipenem.\n● For the treatment of N. farcinica, especially for intracranial infection, imipenem is superior to meropenem.\n● During treatment with voriconazole, if the trough concentration of voriconazole does not reach the target, the concentration can\n\nbe increased by adding omeprazole.\n\nIntroduction\nImmunosuppressed patients are prone to opportunistic infections.1 Nocardia farcinica, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and\nAspergillus fumigatus are opportunistic pathogens, and their risk factors include high-dose glucocorticoids or immuno­\nsuppressants, AIDS, solid organ transplantation, and hematological tumors.2–4 The mortality rate of such infections is\nhigh, and clinical treatment is a great challenge. Co-infection of these three species has not been reported before. We\nreport a case of successful treatment of intracranial infection with N. farcinica combined with pulmonary infection with\nP. jirovecii and A. fumigatus.\n\nInfection and Drug Resistance 2022:15 4853–4857\nReceived: 18 June 2022\nAccepted: 20 August 2022\nPublished: 25 August 2022\n\n4853\n\n© 2022 Jinlin et al.

Ten days later, he developed fever (body temperature of 39°C) accompanied by chills, headache,\nbloating, tinnitus, and hearing loss. Treatment at the local hospital was not effective, and he was transferred to our hospital\nthree days later. On admission, the patient’s body temperature was 38.6°C, blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, respiration was\n16 beats/min, heart rate was 75 beats/min, and he was conscious. Relevant examinations were as follows: white blood cell\ncount of 4.40×109/L, neutrophil percentage of 89.8%, lymphocyte count of 0.17×109/L, CD4+ lymphocyte count of 32/mm3,\nC-reactive protein level of 14.38 mg/L, creatinine level of 37.05 umol/L, pH of 7.399, procalcitonin level of 0.123 ng/mL, and\n1,3-β-D-glucan level of 253.73 pg/mL. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple lesions in the brain.\nEnhanced MRI of the head showed multiple abnormal enhancement shadows in the brain: hematogenous disseminated lesions\nwere possible. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple ground-glass opacities in the anterior segment and lower\nlobe of the left lung. The patient’s cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) had a white blood cell count of 1352×106/L, neutrophil percentage\nof 92%, glucose level of 0.59 mmol/L, and protein level of 1.48 g/L. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the patient’s CSF\nreported 37,235 sequences from N. farcinica and 8 sequences from human cytomegalovirus. Blood NGS reported 61\nsequences from Nocardia farcinica, 543 sequences from human cytomegalovirus, and 8 sequences from P. jirovecii. The\npatient’s condition gradually deteriorated, and he developed confusion and respiratory failure, requiring an invasive ventilator\nto assist breathing. After a week of treatment with meropenem, compound sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), linezolid, and ganci­\nclovir, the patient’s symptoms improved slightly and he could breathe independently (Figure 1). On the 18th day, the patient’s\nsputum culture was positive for A. fumigatus and lung CT showed new lesions. N. farcinica and P. jirovecii were not found in\nthe sputum culture and we did not perform NGS again. The doctor administered voriconazole by intravenous drip (400 mg\nevery 12 hours on the first day then 200 mg every 12 hours) to fight infection. The patient showed minimal response for about a\nweek, with occasional hemoptysis, and the voriconazole trough concentration was 0.8 mg/L. We added oral omeprazole to the\npatient’s regimen. On the 31st day, the patient’s voriconazole trough concentration was 1.1 mg/L, and the blood no longer\nappeared in the sputum. CT showed that the lesions were absorbed better than before. The patient still had occasional\nheadaches. On the 35th day, head MRI still revealed multiple infection lesions, similar to previous scans (Figure 2). We\nreplaced meropenem with imipenem. On the 70th day, head MRI revealed a significantly reduced number of lesions. On the\n78th day, the patient was transferred to a local hospital for continued treatment, and the treatment plan was changed to SMZ\ncombined with linezolid, amoxicillin, and clavulanate potassium. The patient fully recovered after six months of treatment.\n\nFigure 1 Treatment timeline. ✹: Nocardia farcinica; ▲: Pneumocystis jirovecii; and ◉: Aspergillus fumigatus.\nAbbreviations: Cef, Ceftriaxone; Mem, meropenem; Lzd, linezolid; SMZ, compound sulfamethoxazole tablets; Ome, omeprazole tablets; Imi, Imipenem; Vor, voriconazole;\nAmo, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium; PO, oral; NF, nasal feeding; IVD, intravenous drip; q8h, every eight hours; q6h, every 6 hours; q12h, every 12 hours; NGS,\nmetagenomics next-generation sequencing.\n\n4854\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S379005\n\nDovePress\n\nInfection and Drug Resistance 2022:15\n\n\fDovepress\n\nJinlin et al\n\nFigure 2 Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the patient.\n\nDiscussion\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an immunocompromised patient with N. farcinica, P. jirovecii, and\nA. fumigatus co-infection. The patient presented with headache and hearing loss, and multiple lesions were observed on\nhead MRI, which is indicative of intracranial infection. The number of sequences from N. farcinica in the patient’s CSF\nwas very high and CSF examination showed N. farcinica infection in the patient’s brain. The patient’s CSF examination\nwas consistent with purulent meningitis.5\nThe patient had respiratory dysfunction and low immune function; the CD4+ lymphocyte count was only 32/mm3,\nground-glass shadows could be seen on chest CT, sequences from P. jirovecii were detected in the patient’s blood and\n1,3-β-D-glucan levels were as high as 253.73 pg/mL. 1,3-β-D-glucan is an antigenic component of the cell wall of many\nfungi, including P. jirovecii. It can only be used for auxiliary diagnosis of P. jirovecii due to lack of specificity.6,7\nMorjaria’s8 study found that 1,3-β-D-glucan ≥200 pg/mL had a sensitivity of 70%, specificity of 100%, positive\npredictive value of 100% for P. jirovecii. So we believe that the patient in the present case can be diagnosed with P.\njirovecii pneumonia.4,9 The patient’s galactomannan test was negative, and initially he did not use drugs for Aspergillus,\nbut the patient’s dyspnea was relieved after being treated for N. farcinica and P. jirovecii, so we believe that the patient’s\nAspergillus infection is a secondary infection.\nUsing the search terms N. farcinica and P. jirovecii on PubMed, the co-infection of Nocardia and P. jirovecii was found to\nbe very rare and only one report describe this kind of infection and the patient was on SMZ based treatment.10 SMZ is the main\ntreatment for Nocardia and P. jirovecii. Amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, linezolid, and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium\nare all active against N. farcinica. If dissemination or central nervous system infection occurs, at least two drugs should be\nselected for treatment.11 However, amikacin cannot reach an effective concentration intracranially, but imipenem is clinically\neffective and its activity is stronger than that of meropenem and linezolid can achieve a high intracranial concentration and can\n\nInfection and Drug Resistance 2022:15\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S379005\n\nDovePress\n\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n\n4855\n\n\fDovepress\n\nJinlin et al\n\nbe used for severe infections.12 Imipenem can maintain higher concentrations intracranially than meropenem in cerebrospinal\nfluid and is four times more active against Nocardia.13,14 The patient’s initial treatment with a meropenem-based regimen for\none month was ineffective, and a month after imipenem was substituted, the lesions were significantly reduced, proving that\nimipenem is superior to meropenem in the treatment of intracranial infection with N. farcinica.\nOn the 18th day, the patient’s sputum culture was positive for A. fumigatus, and CT showed a new lesion. The doctor\nconsidered fungal infection and initiated voriconazole for treatment. However, during treatment, the patient occasionally\nhad blood in the sputum, and chest CT showed that the infection was still progressing. The voriconazole trough\nconcentration was 0.8 mg/L. According to guidelines and previous reports, the trough concentration of voriconazole\nshould be maintained between 1 and 6 mg/L.15,16 Therefore, the poor antifungal effect observed in patients is likely\nrelated to the insufficient concentration of voriconazole, but voriconazole is very expensive and the treatment course for\nfungal infections is relatively long so patients may not be able to afford higher doses. The label of voriconazole states\nthat CYP450 inhibitors such as omeprazole and esomeprazole will lead to an increase in voriconazole concentration.17\nTherefore, we added omeprazole to the patient’s treatment regimen. After three days, the patient’s voriconazole trough\nconcentration reached the treatment standard, and the patient’s symptoms gradually improved. After about two months of\nvoriconazole treatment, it was discontinued. Therefore, we believe that for patients with insufficient voriconazole\nconcentrations at conventional doses, the voriconazole concentration can be increased by adding omeprazole.\nThere were some limitations in this study. Our microbiology laboratory failed to culture Nocardia and P. jirovecii, and\nwe were unable to perform drug susceptibility testing for Aspergillus. Therefore, the drug susceptibility to these three\npathogens can only be based on previous literature reports. Considering the problem of fungal resistance, drug\nsusceptibility testing should be performed before using triazoles and the treatment strategy with voriconazole is only\napplicable in MIC≤1 ug/mL for Aspergillus.\n\nConclusion\nN. farcinica, P. jirovecii and A. fumigatus are opportunistic pathogens, and co-infection of these three species is very rare.\nThese pathogens are usually associated with strong, long-lasting immunosuppressive regimens, but the tooth extractionassociated incident described in this report highlights the need to pay attention even to such inconspicuous cases. For the\ntreatment of N. farcinica, especially for intracranial infection, imipenem is superior to meropenem. During treatment with\nvoriconazole, if the trough concentration of voriconazole does not reach the target, the concentration can be increased by\nadding omeprazole.\n\nData Sharing Statement\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available since the patient’s medical\nrecords and data are private, but can be made available from the corresponding author on reasonable request under the\nconsent from the patient.\n\nCompliance with Ethics Guidelines\nThis study was conducted following the legal requirements and the Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amend­\nments.
