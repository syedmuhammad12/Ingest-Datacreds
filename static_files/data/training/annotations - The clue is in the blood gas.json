It is imperative to understand the pathophysiology of metformin metabolism to make the easily missed diagnosis. This\ncase highlights the unique laboratory values integral to distinguishing MILA.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes presented to the\nemergency room (ER) for nausea, abdominal pain and confusion for 4 days. Labs were significant for high anion gap greater than\ndetectable on the assay, osmolar gap of 15mEq/L, lactic acid of 19mmol/L, beta-hydroxybutyrate of 42mg/dL, acetone level of\n27mg/dL, creatinine of 13mg/dL (baseline: 1mg/dL) and blood glucose of 82mg/dL. ABG showed a pH of 6.62, pO2 of 149 mm\nHg, pCO2 of 12 mm Hg and bicarbonate of 1 mmol/L. She was noted to be hypotensive and encephalopathic. She underwent\ntreatment with empiric antibiotics, IVF resuscitation and was started on norepinephrine prior to ICU admission. Initial\ndifferential included possible intoxication or euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with acute renal failure. On bedside history, her\ndaughter reported that patient was compliant with her home medications including metformin despite her poor oral intake prior\nto admission. A venous blood gas (VBG) was ordered which showed pO2 of 154mmHg (almost identical to pO2 of 149 mm Hg\nnoted on ABG). Due to her high venous pO2, we had a concern for metformin toxicity. She clinically improved after renal\nreplacement therapy (RRT) and was transferred to the floor two days later. Her metformin level was noted to be 20 times higher\nthan the therapeutic range confirming our suspected diagnosis of MILA.\n\nDISCUSSION: MILA is a rare complication of metformin which has mortality up to 45%. Diagnosis is difficult as the concurrent\nketoacidosis and associated osmolar gap can be confusing with various intoxications or euglycemic DKA. The pathophysiology\ninvolves the accumulation of metformin which inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain. This inhibition prevents\nutilization of oxygen that is delivered to tissue for aerobic respiration. As a result, there is a profound lactic acidosis usually over\n15mmol/L with a VBG showing pO2 similar to ABG as noted in animal studies. The metformin levels must be elevated enough to\ncause this cascade which can happen in overdose or acute renal failure. Treatment requires RRT and in some cases, extracorporeal\nmembrane oxygenation (ECMO).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MILA is a rare critical illness with high mortality. Diagnosis can be challenging due to broad differentials of\nanion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA). This patient had a favorable outcome due to high suspicion and prompt treatment.\nMetformin levels take time to result and analyzing VBG to determine oxygen consumption can help make the diagnosis.\nReference #1: Renda F, Mura P, Finco G, Ferrazin F, Pani L, Landoni G.
