Saunders\r\nABSTRACT\r\nSevere metabolic acidosis can be life-threatening. Its etiology may be obscure, and a\r\nhigh level of suspicion and appropriate history are keys to recognize and provide\r\nappropriate treatment. This is a puzzling case of recurrent severe acidosis that\r\nillustrates the importance of obtaining medication history to avoid significant harm. A\r\nHispanic man with DM, HTN, and ESKD on HD presented to the ER with confusion,\r\ndyspnea, and abdominal pain with diarrhea. Labs were significant for CO2<5 mEq/L and\r\nlactic acid of 20.4 mmol/L and venous blood gas pH of 6.7. The patient missed no\r\ndialysis sessions; toxicology screening was negative. He was treated empirically for\r\nsepsis and routine dialysis with resolution of the acidosis. His blood cultures came back\r\nnegative, and he was discharged. Two days later, he came back to ER with the same\r\nsymptoms, serum CO2<5 mEq/L, and lactic acid 19.5 mmol/L. Workup for DKA, sepsis,\r\nand bowel ischemia was negative. He was treated with dialysis and the acidosis\r\nresolved. He presented again a week later with similar symptoms and serum CO2<5\r\nmEq/L with lactic acid of 17.7 mmol/L. The consulting nephrologist got suspicious and\r\nrequested his wife to bring all his medicines from home. It turns out that he was taking\r\nmetformin and had forgotten to disclose it. He was dialyzed and improved. He was\r\ninstructed to never take metformin again and, in the future, to disclose all medicines\r\nprescribed. Metformin associated metabolic acidosis (MALA) has a high mortality. Since\r\nit is cleared by the kidneys, CKD patients are highly at risk. The drug should not be\r\ntaken if eGFR is < 30 ml/min and is contraindicated in dialysis patients. Metformin\r\ntoxicity presents as confusion, dyspnea, and GI upset. Treatment is supportive and\r\ndialysis is recommended for encephalopathy, lactic acid > 20 mmol/L or arterial pH<7.\r\nProviders must think broadly as to the cause of severe metabolic derangements. This\r\ncase illustrates the importance of a complete patient history and medication\r\nreconciliation to avoid delays in diagnosis that may lead to potential deadly\r\ncomplications. Peer education to include PCPs, NPs and PAs is of utmost importance to\r\navoid incidents like this one.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\ncarbon dioxide; lactic acid; metformin\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\narterial pH; metabolic acidosis\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nabdominal pain; adult; blood culture; blood gas; brain disease; case report; clinical\r\narticle; complication; conference abstract; diarrhea; drug toxicity; dyspnea;\r\neducation; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; gastrointestinal symptom;\r\nhemodialysis patient; Hispanic; human; human tissue; intestine ischemia; kidney;\r\nRecord downloaded - Tue 9 06 14:36:28 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nmale; medical history; medication therapy management; mortality; nephrologist; risk\r\nassessment; sepsis; side effect; toxicology; venous blood; wife\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\ncarbon dioxide (124-38-9, 58561-67-4)\r\nlactic acid (113-21-3, 50-21-5)\r\nmetformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\nEnglish\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\nEnglish\r\nPUI\r\nL2017310641\r\nDOI\r\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.01.399\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.01.399\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2017310641&from\r\n=export\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\r\nA case reported from United States \r\nUS, Farmakis C, Sebastian L.
