We report a case of anaphylactic shock\r\nsecondary to the administration of IV dexamethasone during spinal surgery. Methods: A\r\n67-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension and kyphoscoliosis status\r\npost spinal fusion surgery performed a month before presenting with two weeks of\r\nprogressively worsening paresis of the lower extremities associated with urinary and\r\nfecal incontinence and band-like distribution of pain in the T4 distribution. Her\r\nneurological examination was remarkable for a decreased tone and strength in the\r\nlower extremities with diminished sensation to pin-prick and vibration at the T4 spinal\r\ndistribution. CT imaging revealed a T3-4 epidural hematoma and flexion distraction\r\nfracture of T3-4 vertebra causing cord compression. She underwent an emergent T3-4\r\ndecompressive laminectomy/facetectomy. Intraoperatively she received 10 mg of IV\r\ndexamethasone and two minutes later she developed acute circulatory failure requiring\r\nhigh doses of norepinephrine and epinephrine. An intra-op POCUS showed\r\nhyperdynamic LV function and normal RV:LV ratio; there was no evidence of a\r\npericardial effusion and lung sliding was appreciated at the bilateral apices excluding\r\ncardiogenic or obstructive etiology of her shock from either massive pulmonary\r\nembolism, cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax. Hypovolemic shock was\r\nunlikely given minimal blood loss. Review of her medical history from a different hospital\r\nrevealed prior episodes of urticarial skin rash with IV methylprednisolone. This clinical\r\ncorrelate in conjunction with the temporal relationship between administration of IV\r\ndexamethasone and the ensuing circulatory collapse prompted the diagnoses of\r\nanaphylactic shock secondary to steroids. Results: Hypersensitivity reactions related to\r\nsteroids are uncommon and often misdiagnosed. It is unclear whether the triggering\r\nmolecule is the steroid itself, or if the steroids or its metabolites act like a hapten bound\r\nto serum protein, creating an allergenic complex. Anaphylactic shock should be\r\nconsidered in a patient with previous IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction to any class\r\nof glucocorticoids such as urticarial skin rash with our patient.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\ndexamethasone\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nepinephrine; hapten; noradrenalin; plasma protein\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\nimmediate type hypersensitivity\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nadverse drug reaction; aged; anaphylaxis; case report; compression; diagnosis;\r\ndiagnostic error; disease course; drug megadose; epidural hematoma; feces\r\nincontinence; female; fracture; heart tamponade; human; human tissue;\r\nhypertension; hypovolemic shock; kyphoscoliosis; laminectomy; lower limb; lung\r\nembolism; medical history; metabolite; neurologic examination; pain; paresis; rash;\r\nRecord downloaded - Fri 11 04 05:07:39 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nsensation; side effect; spine fusion; surgery; tension pneumothorax; urine\r\nincontinence; vertebra; vibration\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\ndexamethasone (50-02-2)\r\nepinephrine (51-43-4, 55-31-2, 6912-68-1)\r\nnoradrenalin (1407-84-7, 51-41-2) United States\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\nEnglish\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\nEnglish\r\nPUI\r\nL620079191\r\nDOI\r\n10.1097/01.ccm.0000528157.26794.72\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000528157.26794.72\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L620079191&from=\r\nexport\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nMartillo M, Zarbiv S, Dangayach N.
