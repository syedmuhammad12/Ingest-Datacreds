We report the second case of PCP pneumonia\r\ncoinfection in a HIV- uninfected man with COVID-19. CASE: A 52 y/o man with PMH of\r\nhyperlipidemia, gout, viral myocarditis and no prior immunodeficient conditions was admitted to\r\nhospital for COVID-19 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) CoV- 2 Pneumonia. He was\r\ninitially treated with Dexamethasone 6mg/day, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab x 2doses and oxygen\r\ntherapy. On day 4, he was transferred to ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring NIV\r\neventually requiring intubation with Fio2-60-90%. His course was complicated by AKI, septic shock\r\nrequiring pressor for BP support. He received empiric ceftriaxone and Hydrocortisone for\r\nsuspected adrenal insufficiency. Despite antibiotics, labs showed increasing WBC count with\r\ndecreasing procalcitonin. Blood/urine cultures: no growth. Tracheal cultures: Ceftriaxone-sensitive\r\nE.coli therefore was continued on ceftriaxone. On ICU day3, he was still febrile so was started on\r\nprophylactic Bactrim for PCP suspecting immunosuppression although he was never treated with\r\nlong term high dose steroids. Fungal cultures, Aspergillus, HIV, Beta-D glucan - negative. He was\r\nafebrile after 7days of antibiotics and PCP testing was done to discontinue Bactrim. Tracheal\r\naspirate culture reported positive for PCP diagnosed with IFA stain. LDH - 471 but is an unreliable\r\nmarker in the setting of covid pneumonia. HRCT was not attained due to unstable hemodynamics.\r\nProphylactic Bactrim was then switched to therapeutic dose and also started on Prednisone 40mg\r\ntwice daily on tapered dose. DISCUSSION: PCP is an infection commonly seen in\r\nimmunocompromised individuals but may colonize healthy individuals remaining asymptomatic and\r\nserving as a reservoir to transmit and affect immunocompromised hosts with immunodeficiency\r\nsyndromes/malignancy/organ transplant. Diagnosis is made via identification of organism via\r\nstaining/PCR. Based on previous case series reported by Mayo Clinic amongst HIV- uninfected\r\nindividuals, an average dose of steroids was 30mg/ day (minimum-16mg/ day) for an average\r\nduration of 12 weeks (minimum-8weeks) to acquire PCP infection. Our subject was treated with\r\nHydrocortisone dose equivalent to a prednisone dose ∼ 75mg/day x 1 week which may have\r\ninduced immunosuppression or due to COVID-19 infection itself making him susceptible for PCP\r\ninfection. First case of PCP pneumonia coinfection in COVID-19 (recovered) was reported in\r\nMarch 2021. CONCLUSION: Our case report is unique for two reasons, PCP diagnosis via tracheal\r\naspirate and two, detected in COVID-19 infected patient post prophylaxis. PCP coinfection with\r\nCOVID-19 should be identified and treated.\r\nThis abstract is funded by: N/A\r\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2022;205:A4515\r\nInternet address: www.atsjournals.org Online Abstracts Issue",{"entities":[[154,255,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[257,259,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[260,271,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[273,327,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[329,367,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[369,374,"REPORTERCITY"],[380,393,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[722,748,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[797,799,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[804,807,"PATIENTSEX"],[905,926,"SERIOUSNESSHOSPITALIZATION"],[1030,1043,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1053,1063,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1068,1079,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1196,1199,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[1354,1365,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1370,1384,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1431,1448,"TESTNAME"],[1456,1466,"TESTRESULT"],[1467,1476,"TESTNAME"],[1483,1493,"TESTRESULT"],[1509,1529,"TESTNAME"],[1531,1541,"TESTRESULT"],[1542,1590,"MEDICALHISTORYEPISODE"],[1618,1630,"TESTNAME"],[1634,1642,"TESTRESULT"],[1808,1856,"TESTNAME"],[1859,1868,"TESTRESULT"],[1941,1952,"ACTIONDRUG"],[1953,1961,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[2041,2044,"TESTNAME"],[2047,2050,"TESTRESULT"],[3439,3469,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"],[3470,3484,"LITERATURE REFERENCE"]]}],["C61 BREAKING THE MOLD / Thematic Poster Session / Tuesday, May 17/09:30 AM-03:45 PM / Area C, Hall F (North Building,\r\nExhibition Level), Moscone Center\r\nA Unique Case of Pneumocystis Jirovecii (PCP) Pneumonia in HIVUninfected,\r\nCOVID -19 Positive Patient\r\nV.
