We report a\r\ncase of vasospastic angina with refractory CCB-associated edema. A 78-year-old man had refractory edema induced by a CCB.\r\nIt was successfully treated with tolvaptan, an active vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist.

Introduction\r\nCalcium channel blockers (CCBs) are commonly used antihypertensive\r\ndrugs. Peripheral edema is a common dosedependent\r\nadverse effect. CCB-associated peripheral edema\r\nis thought to result from preferential arteriolar dilatation.\r\nRenin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors can reduce\r\nCCB-associated peripheral edema by decreasing postcapillary\r\nresistance, which normalizes intracapillary pressure\r\nand reduces fluid extravasation. No other medications for\r\nCCB-associated peripheral edema have been reported. We\r\ndescribe successful treatment of CCB-associated peripheral\r\nedema using tolvaptan, an active vasopressin V2 receptor\r\nantagonist, in a patient with vasospastic angina who had been\r\nresistant to conventional diuretic and RAS inhibitor therapy.\r\n2. Case Presentation\r\nA 78-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with bilateral\r\nlower extremity swelling. He could not put on shoes of\r\nhis usual size due to severe edema. His blood pressure was\r\n126/62mmHg, and pulse was 83 beats/min. Compared to\r\nhis usual body weight, there was a 10 kg increase, up to\r\n71 kg. Physical examination was notable for pitting edema\r\non both lower extremities (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Furthermore,\r\nhe had edema on his face and upper extremities. His\r\njugular veins were not dilated.\r\nHis medical history included vasospastic angina, chronic\r\nkidney disease, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Two\r\nmonths prior, he was diagnosed with vasospastic angina\r\nbecause of transient ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram\r\nduring a heart attack, which was relieved by sublingual\r\nnitroglycerin (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Coronary\r\nangiography showed stenosis of the left anterior descending\r\nartery, which improved with nitroglycerin injection into the\r\nleft coronary artery via a catheter (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).\r\nHe was prescribed nifedipine 40mg daily because he had\r\nexperienced angina with amlodipine 5mg per day, but\r\nangina with ST-segment elevation recurred several times.\r\nFinally, he was discharged after being gradually titrated to\r\nnifedipine 80mg per day, diltiazem 200mg per day, and\r\nnitroglycerin patch 27mg per 24 hours.\r\nThe differential diagnosis included CCB-associated\r\nperipheral edema, congestive heart failure, kidney failure,\r\ncirrhosis, hypothyroidism, and deep venous thrombosis.\r\nLaboratory tests revealed elevated creatinine (1.25 mg/dL)\r\nHindawi\r\nCase Reports in Cardiology\r\nVolume 2022, Article ID 9550006, 5 pages\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9550006\r\nand B-type natriuretic peptide (128 pg/mL; normal range <\r\n18 pg/mL), but no significant changes from baseline.

The patient could\r\nnot tolerate a higher dose of enalapril because of dizziness\r\ndue to hypotension. Furosemide was discontinued because\r\nit decreased renal function. After adding spironolactone\r\n25mg per day, he lost 4 kg of body weight, but edema and\r\npleural effusion remained. Concerned about the recurrence\r\nof angina, the patient disagreed with CCB discontinuation or\r\ndose reduction. When we tried the active vasopressin V2\r\nreceptor antagonist tolvaptan at 7.5mg per day, his urine output\r\nincreased and his edema gradually resolved (Figure 1(c)).\r\nHe lost 12 kg of body weight; his weight decreased to 59 kg.\r\nHe had no adverse side effects while taking tolvaptan, such\r\nas hypernatremia.

After discharge, the frequency of tolvaptan\r\nwas decreased to every other day, with no recurrences\r\nof peripheral edema and no side effects from tolvaptan.\r\n3. Discussion\r\nThis case indicated that tolvaptan has favorable effects on\r\nCCB-associated peripheral edema. Peripheral edema is a\r\ncommon adverse effect of CCBs. The incidence of peripheral\r\nedema is both dose- and duration-dependent. The incidence\r\nmight exceed 80% with very high doses of dihydropyridine\r\nCCBs [1]. Furthermore, conventional racemic amlodipine\r\ncauses edema more commonly than the S-isomer of amlodipine\r\n[2]. Treatment of CCB-associated peripheral edema\r\nconsists of CCB dose reduction or discontinuation. A previous\r\nmeta-analysis reported that combining angiotensinconverting\r\nenzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor\r\nblockers (ARBs) with CCBs reduces the incidence of\r\nCCB-associated edema by 38%. The CCB discontinuation\r\nrate due to peripheral edema with RAS inhibitors was 62%\r\nlower than with CCB monotherapy [3]. In addition, ACE\r\ninhibitors seem to be more effective than ARBs in reducing\r\nCCB-associated peripheral edema [3]. However, edema is\r\nsometimes refractory. Peripheral edema is considered to be\r\nthe result of peripheral arteriolar dilatation, which increases\r\nthe pressure gradient between arteriolar and venule capillaries\r\nand leads to extravasation of intravascular fluid. RAS\r\ninhibitors decrease postcapillary resistance, which normalizes\r\nintracapillary pressure and reduces fluid extravasation.\r\nThis patient required high doses of nifedipine and diltiazem\r\nto control angina. The combination of these two drugs\r\nincreases the blood concentration of nifedipine and potentiates\r\nits antihypertensive effects. Thus, he could not tolerate\r\nACE inhibitors at a sufficiently high dose. Dihydropyridineassociated\r\nedema occasionally occurs despite the use of\r\nRAS inhibitors in addition to a diuretic. Exchanging nifedipine\r\nfor extended-release diltiazem or felodipine led to\r\npatient tolerability and blood pressure control [4]. Although\r\nthere has been a case report showing that the combination of\r\ndihydropyridine and diltiazem lowers blood pressure\r\nthrough their interaction [5], there have been no reports of\r\nrefractory edema due to that interaction.\r\nThis patient was concerned about the recurrence of\r\nangina. Thus, he disagreed with CCB discontinuation or\r\ndose reduction. Furthermore, since he had mild chronic kidney\r\ndisease, the edema was extremely severe and his\r\nresponse to conventional diuretics was poor. Refractory\r\nperipheral edema developed; low-dose RAS inhibitor therapy\r\ndid not reduce the edema.\r\nTolvaptan has a diuretic effect with a mechanism that is\r\ndifferent from that of conventional diuretics. Tolvaptan is an\r\norally active vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist that blocks\r\narginine vasopressin from binding to V2 receptors in the\r\nDiscontinuation of CCB\r\nCombination of\r\nDP-CCB and diltiazem\r\nDosage adjustment\r\nSwitching to non-DP CCB\r\nNo\r\nNo\r\nAdding an ACEI, ARB, or a nitrate\r\n(First-line; ACEI)\r\nAdding a tolvaptan\r\nReconsideration of\r\ndiscontinuation of CCB\r\nYes Other antihypertensives\r\nor antianginal agents\r\nYes Consideration of\r\ndiscontinuation of DP-CCB\r\nDiscontinuation of diltiazem\r\nNo\r\nCCB-associated peripheral edema\r\nNon-pharmacological\r\nintervention\r\nFigure 4: Treatment strategies for patients with CCB-associated peripheral edema.

Although loop diuretics predominantly decrease extracellular\r\nwater (ECW) rather than intracellular water (ICW), a\r\nprevious study that involved bioimpedance analysis showed\r\nthat tolvaptan ameliorates body fluid retention and induces\r\nequivalent reductions in ICW and ECW without worsening\r\nrenal function [7]. Another study showed that tolvaptan\r\nrestores body fluids by the efficient reduction of intracellular\r\nfluid than hemodialysis, by reducing the volume of intracellular\r\nfluid by a greater amount and maintaining more fluid in\r\nthe extracellular space [8]. Tolvaptan induces diuresis of free\r\nwater and an increase in serum sodium. Because the serum\r\nsodium concentration and the interstitial sodium concentration\r\nis identical, tolvaptan then induces an increase in the\r\nosmolarity of both the intravessel compartment and the interstitial\r\ncompartment which would accelerate the oncotic forces\r\nleading to fluid movement from the intracellular compartment\r\nto the interstitial compartment. Tolvaptan helps maintain\r\na lower intravessel volume and promote efficient\r\ndiuresis, which ultimately decreases the fluid in the interstitium\r\n(i.e., edema). To treat CCB-associated peripheral edema,\r\ntolvaptan might work by helping fluid move fromthe intracellular\r\ncompartment to the interstitial compartment. Furthermore,\r\ntolvaptan is reported to be effective for patients with\r\nchronic kidney disease [9]. In addition, dihydropyridine CCBs\r\nhave a sodium diuretic effect; peripheral edema is not due to\r\nsalt retention [10]. Therefore, classical diuretic treatment is\r\nnot expected to be effective. However, tolvaptan was effective\r\nfor this patient with CCB-associated peripheral edema.\r\nFigure 4 shows the strategy for patients with CCB-associated\r\nperipheral edema [11].\r\nThis case demonstrated that tolvaptan had a favorable\r\neffect on CCB-associated peripheral edema. It also suggested\r\nthat an oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist could\r\nreduce CCB-associated peripheral edema in a patient with\r\nrefractory edema even after CCB dose reduction or RAS\r\ninhibitor therapy.\r\nAbbreviations\r\nACE: Angiotensin-converting enzyme\r\nARB: Angiotensin II receptor blocker\r\nCCB: Calcium channel blocker\r\nECW: Extracellular water\r\nICW: Intracellular water\r\nRAS: Renin-angiotensin system.\r\nData Availability\r\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are\r\nincluded in the article.\r\nEthical Approval\r\nThe study was approved by the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular\r\nCenter (case report 21-029).\r\nConsent\r\nThe patient gave written consent for publication of this report.\r\nConflicts of Interest\r\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nMasashi Fujino is supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young\r\nScientists from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science\r\n(20K17138).\r\nReferences\r\n[1] F.

The combination of these two drugs\r\nincreases the blood concentration of nifedipine and potentiates\r\nits antihypertensive effects. Thus, he could not tolerate\r\nACE inhibitors at a sufficiently high dose. Dihydropyridineassociated\r\nedema occasionally occurs despite the use of\r\nRAS inhibitors in addition to a diuretic. Exchanging nifedipine\r\nfor extended-release diltiazem or felodipine led to\r\npatient tolerability and blood pressure control [4]. Although\r\nthere has been a case report showing that the combination of\r\ndihydropyridine and diltiazem lowers blood pressure\r\nthrough their interaction [5], there have been no reports of\r\nrefractory edema due to that interaction.\r\nThis patient was concerned about the recurrence of\r\nangina. Thus, he disagreed with CCB discontinuation or\r\ndose reduction. Furthermore, since he had mild chronic kidney\r\ndisease, the edema was extremely severe and his\r\nresponse to conventional diuretics was poor. Refractory\r\nperipheral edema developed; low-dose RAS inhibitor therapy\r\ndid not reduce the edema.\r\nTolvaptan has a diuretic effect with a mechanism that is\r\ndifferent from that of conventional diuretics. Tolvaptan is an\r\norally active vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist that blocks\r\narginine vasopressin from binding to V2 receptors in the\r\nDiscontinuation of CCB\r\nCombination of\r\nDP-CCB and diltiazem\r\nDosage adjustment\r\nSwitching to non-DP CCB\r\nNo\r\nNo\r\nAdding an ACEI, ARB, or a nitrate\r\n(First-line; ACEI)\r\nAdding a tolvaptan\r\nReconsideration of\r\ndiscontinuation of CCB\r\nYes Other antihypertensives\r\nor antianginal agents\r\nYes Consideration of\r\ndiscontinuation of DP-CCB\r\nDiscontinuation of diltiazem\r\nNo\r\nCCB-associated peripheral edema\r\nNon-pharmacological\r\nintervention\r\nFigure 4: Treatment strategies for patients with CCB-associated peripheral edema.

Although loop diuretics predominantly decrease extracellular\r\nwater (ECW) rather than intracellular water (ICW), a\r\nprevious study that involved bioimpedance analysis showed\r\nthat tolvaptan ameliorates body fluid retention and induces\r\nequivalent reductions in ICW and ECW without worsening\r\nrenal function [7]. Another study showed that tolvaptan\r\nrestores body fluids by the efficient reduction of intracellular\r\nfluid than hemodialysis, by reducing the volume of intracellular\r\nfluid by a greater amount and maintaining more fluid in\r\nthe extracellular space [8]. Tolvaptan induces diuresis of free\r\nwater and an increase in serum sodium. Because the serum\r\nsodium concentration and the interstitial sodium concentration\r\nis identical, tolvaptan then induces an increase in the\r\nosmolarity of both the intravessel compartment and the interstitial\r\ncompartment which would accelerate the oncotic forces\r\nleading to fluid movement from the intracellular compartment\r\nto the interstitial compartment. Tolvaptan helps maintain\r\na lower intravessel volume and promote efficient\r\ndiuresis, which ultimately decreases the fluid in the interstitium\r\n(i.e., edema). To treat CCB-associated peripheral edema,\r\ntolvaptan might work by helping fluid move fromthe intracellular\r\ncompartment to the interstitial compartment. Furthermore,\r\ntolvaptan is reported to be effective for patients with\r\nchronic kidney disease [9]. In addition, dihydropyridine CCBs\r\nhave a sodium diuretic effect; peripheral edema is not due to\r\nsalt retention [10]. Therefore, classical diuretic treatment is\r\nnot expected to be effective. However, tolvaptan was effective\r\nfor this patient with CCB-associated peripheral edema.\r\nFigure 4 shows the strategy for patients with CCB-associated\r\nperipheral edema [11].\r\nThis case demonstrated that tolvaptan had a favorable\r\neffect on CCB-associated peripheral edema. It also suggested\r\nthat an oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist could\r\nreduce CCB-associated peripheral edema in a patient with\r\nrefractory edema even after CCB dose reduction or RAS\r\ninhibitor therapy.\r\nAbbreviations\r\nACE: Angiotensin-converting enzyme\r\nARB: Angiotensin II receptor blocker\r\nCCB: Calcium channel blocker\r\nECW: Extracellular water\r\nICW: Intracellular water\r\nRAS: Renin-angiotensin system.\r\nData Availability\r\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are\r\nincluded in the article.\r\nEthical Approval\r\nThe study was approved by the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular\r\nCenter (case report 21-029).\r\nConsent\r\nThe patient gave written consent for publication of this report.\r\nConflicts of Interest\r\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nMasashi Fujino is supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Young\r\nScientists from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science\r\n(20K17138).\r\nReferences\r\n[1] F.
