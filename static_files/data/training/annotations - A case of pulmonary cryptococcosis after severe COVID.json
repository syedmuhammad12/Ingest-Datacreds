Three months prior, she had been diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, for\r\nwhich she received dexamethasone, remdesivir, tocilizumab, anakinra, and IVIG. She was discharged to a nursing\r\nfacility with a prolonged steroid taper, ending 1 month prior to admission.In the ED, the patient had a chest x-ray\r\nthat demonstrated bibasilar atelectasis and opacification, and a CT chest revealed right lower lobe consolidation\r\nand surrounding ground glass opacities. A respiratory pathogen PCR swab was negative. Sputum culture was\r\nnegative for bacterial and fungal growth. Blood cultures did not grow any organisms. Given recent\r\nimmunosuppression and imaging findings, a serum Cryptococcal antigen was drawn, which was positive with a\r\ntiter of 1:128. A transthoracic needle biopsy of the patientâ€™s right lower lung was then performed. The specimen\r\ndid not grow any bacteria or fungi and AFB stain on the tissue was negative. Pathology demonstrated a collection\r\nof histiocytes, neutrophils, and necrotic debris. PAS, GMS, and mucicarmine stains were positive for fungal\r\norganisms consistent with Cryptococcus species. Discussion:Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection due\r\npredominately to one of two encapsulated yeasts, Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii. C.\r\nneoformans is found in soil worldwide, and infection typically begins with spore inhalation. Clinically significant\r\ndisease is seen mostly in immunocompromised patients.Corticosteroids and interleukin inhibitors, such as\r\nanakinra (IL-1) and tocilizumab (IL-6), are used in the treatment of COVID-19. These medications have been\r\nassociated with increased risk for opportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections. The diagnosis of\r\npulmonary cryptococcosis may be challenging, as symptoms are often nonspecific and may radiographically\r\nresemble bacterial pneumonia, malignancy, or other infections. Serum cryptococcal antigen detection tests may\r\nbe helpful in establishing the diagnosis, as well as histopathology showing narrow-based budding yeast.\r\nConclusion: Patients with prior COVID-19 infection commonly return to healthcare settings with sequelae of their\r\nprevious coronavirus infection. In our case, it was the prior treatment of COVID-19, which included\r\nimmunomodulating therapy, that lead to a secondary pulmonary cryptococcal infection. When evaluating pulmonary\r\nprocesses that evolve after an acute infection with COVID-19, it is important to keep a broad differential, including\r\nuncommon and/or opportunistic infectious etiologies, particularly when a patient has received prolonged courses\r\nof steroids and tocilizumab.\r\nThis abstract is funded by: None\r\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med 2022;205:A5449\r\nInternet address: www.atsjournals.org Online Abstracts Issue",{"entities":[[379,616,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[618,621,"REPORTERTITLE"],[622,623,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[624,630,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[632,658,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[660,679,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[681,693,"REPORTERCITY"],[695,697,"REPORTERSTATE"],[699,701,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[728,1142,"RESULTSTESTSPROCEDURES"],[1166,1188,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1190,1219,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1221,1236,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1238,1256,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1258,1272,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1292,1302,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1304,1318,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1320,1333,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1335,1343,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1345,1356,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1377,1387,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1389,1403,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1405,1418,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1420,1428,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1430,1441,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1443,1469,"TESTNAME"],[1471,1507,"TESTNAME"],[1509,1520,"TESTNAME"],[1522,1535,"TESTNAME"],[1537,1562,"TESTNAME"],[1564,1578,"TESTNAME"],[1580,1600,"TESTNAME"],[1602,1617,"TESTNAME"],[1619,1633,"TESTNAME"],[1635,1642,"TESTNAME"],[1644,1675,"TESTNAME"],[1677,1680,"TESTNAME"],[1700,1718,"DRUGINDICATION"],[1754,1756,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[1760,1766,"PATIENTSEX"],[1785,1788,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[1806,1843,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[1879,1921,"SERIOUSNESSHOSPITALIZATION"],[2123,2128,"PATIENTMEDICALHISTORYTEXT"],[2297,2318,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2323,2336,"TESTRESULT"],[2344,2392,"TESTRESULT"],[2806,2896,"TESTRESULT"],[2897,2983,"TESTRESULT"],[3693,3717,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[4270,4313,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"]]}]]}
