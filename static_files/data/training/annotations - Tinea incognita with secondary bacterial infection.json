This worsens the underlying infection without\nbecoming clinically apparent until treatment is withdrawn, in which case the tinea\ninfection becomes acutely symptomatic. We herein report a case of tinea incognita in a\nyoung woman treated with high-potency topical corticosteroids, leading to worsening\ndermatophyte infection and coinfection with Klebsiella oxytoca. The resulting infection\nrequired aggressive oral and topical antimicrobial treatment before resolving. This case\nillustrates the potentially harmful sequelae of using high-potency topical corticosteroids\nwithout first ruling out tinea infection.\nAUTHOR KEYWORDS\nBacterial coinfection\nfolliculitis\ntinea incognita\ntopical corticosteroids\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\nalclometasone (drug therapy, unexpected outcome of drug treatment); amoxicillin plus\nclavulanic acid (drug therapy, oral drug administration); clindamycin (drug therapy,\ntopical drug administration); clobetasol (drug therapy, unexpected outcome of drug\ntreatment); clotrimazole (drug therapy, topical drug administration); ketoconazole (drug\ntherapy, topical drug administration); mometasone furoate (drug therapy); potassium\nhydroxide\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\nbacterial infection (drug therapy); tinea (drug therapy)\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\nadult; allergic contact dermatitis (drug therapy); antibiotic therapy; antifungal therapy;\narticle; axilla; burn; case report; Caucasian; clinical article; cream; drug withdrawal;\nfemale; fever; folliculitis (drug therapy); human; ointment; papular rash; papule;\npruritus; rash (drug therapy); self medication\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\nalclometasone (67452-97-5)\namoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (74469-00-4, 79198-29-1)\nclindamycin (18323-44-9, 21462-39-5)\nclobetasol (25122-41-2)\nclotrimazole (23593-75-1)\nketoconazole (65277-42-1, 83374-59-8)\nmometasone furoate (83919-23-7, 105102-22-5)\npotassium hydroxide (1310-58-3)\nEMBASE CLASSIFICATIONS\n\nRecord downloaded - Mon 11 07 13:32:02 UTC 2022\n\nPage 2\n\n\fDermatology and Venereology (13)\nDrug Literature Index (37)\nMicrobiology: Bacteriology, Mycology, Parasitology and Virology (4)\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\nEnglish\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\nEnglish\nPUI\nL638975180\nDOI\n10.4103/jdds.jdds_22_19\nFULL TEXT LINK\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4103/jdds.jdds_22_19\nEMBASE LINK\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L638975180&from=\nexport\nCOPYRIGHT\nCopyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.\n\nRecord downloaded - Mon 11 07 13:32:02 UTC 2022\n\nPage 3\n\n\f",{"entities":[[0,3,"REPORTERTITLE"],[4,10,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[11,13,"REPORTERMIDDLENAME"],[14,22,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[24,61,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[63,74,"REPORTERDEPARTMENT"],[76,85,"REPORTERCITY"],[87,95,"REPORTERSTATE"],[97,99,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[101,103,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[126,299,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[321,342,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[344,356,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[358,370,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[390,418,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[420,435,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[437,480,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[482,506,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[508,523,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[535,566,"TESTNAME"],[568,575,"TESTNAME"],[593,612,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[614,629,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[631,646,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[648,664,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[682,709,"DRUGINDICATION"],[711,723,"DRUGINDICATION"],[744,772,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[774,789,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[791,815,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[817,832,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[834,877,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[899,914,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2130,2135,"PATIENTSEX"],[2235,2271,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2401,2429,"SERIOUS"],[2633,2646,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[2776,2787,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[2833,2843,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[3014,3024,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[3488,3503,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"]]}]]}
