Introduction\nPortal vein aneurysm (PVA) is an unusual form of portal\nvein vasodilatation with an incidence of 0.06%.[1] Patients\nwith PVA are usually asymptomatic. Indeed, most patients\nwith PVA are detected incidentally by computed tomography\n(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound.[1,2]\nPortal hypertension is the leading cause of acquired PVA.[1]\nConservative management or surgery is recommended based\non the patient’s underlying risks and symptoms.[1,2] A congenital portosystemic venous shunt is a rare type of congenital\ndysplasia in which the intrahepatic portal vein communicates\nwith a systemic vein through an abnormal intrahepatic venous\nchannel, usually along with secondary complications such as\nhypoxia and focal intrahepatic lesions.[3] The characteristics\nand natural course of intrahepatic malformations vary in these\npatients.[4] A spontaneous intrahepatic portosystemic venous\nshunt is also rare, with an extremely low incidence in adults.[5]\n\n2. Case report\nA 75-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of significant weight loss and diabetes on October 13, 2020.\nShe was prescribed the following medications before admission:\nmetformin (0.5 g twice a day), acarbose (50 mg 3 times a day),\nand repaglinide (1 mg twice a day). The metformin dose was\nincreased to 1 g/day without medical advice 6 weeks before\nadmission. She had coronary heart disease and was prescribed\nthe following medications: isosorbide nitrate tablets, 5 mg in the\nmorning, 10 mg in the afternoon, and 5 mg in the evening; 10\ncapsules of Danshen dripping pills, 3 times a day; and atorvastatin, 10 mg once in the evening.

The results suggested that the branch of the portal and hepatic veins communicated through a tubular or tumor-like structure during\nthe portal vein phase, and the hepatic vein was enhanced\nearly and nonuniformly. A portosystemic shunt can show\ntransient, non-specific, uniform relative enhancement during\nthe portal vein and delayed phases of contrast-enhanced\nultrasonography and may lead to increased blood flow in the\nshunt portal vein, resulting in reduced blood flow to the normal liver parenchyma surrounding the lesion.[6] The findings\nin this patient were similar to those seen in portosystemic\nshunts. MRI and further contrast-enhanced examination\nof the upper abdomen revealed a round-shaped abnormal signal shadow in the left lateral lobe of the liver. The\nshadow measured approximately 4.5 × 2.0 × 3.0 cm, showing\nuneven long T1 and T2 signals, and low signals on diffusion-weighted imaging. The arterial phase enhanced slightly\nafter injection of the contrast agent. A tortuous and thickened vascular shadow was found during the portal phase,\nwith a signal intensity after contrast enhancement similar to\nthe portal vein. The lesions showed communication with the\nleft hepatic vein during the balanced phase and merged with\nthe inferior vena cava. MRI results suggested an abnormal\nshadow in the left lobe of the liver, a portosystemic shunt,\nand PVA formation.\nThe final diagnosis was PVA combined with an intrahepatic\nportosystemic venous shunt. Because the patient had no relevant clinical symptoms because of the PVA and intrahepatic\nportosystemic venous shunt, the physician did not take any\nmeasures but recommended close follow-up. Interventional\nsurgery was recommended if the patient experienced pain or\ndiscomfort. The patient was subsequently treated for diabetes\nand coronary heart disease after discharge from the hospital\non November 1, 2020, without intervention for PVA and intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt. Subcutaneous insulin\ntreatment for diabetes was continued. The pre-hospital medication regimen for coronary heart disease was continued after\n\nconsidered that the weight loss might be related to metformin;\ntherefore, metformin was discontinued. The acarbose capsules\nand repaglinide tablets were discontinued due to blood glucose level fluctuations, and a subcutaneous injection of insulin\nwas used to lower the blood glucose level. After admission, the\npre-hospital medication regimen for coronary heart disease was\ncontinued.\nThe patient had no history of hepatitis, trauma, or liver surgery. She denied having a family history of diabetes, hereditary\nor infectious diseases. A cyst was previously diagnosed in the\nleft lobe of the liver using ultrasonography. CT examination of\nthe upper abdomen revealed a round, low-density shadow in\nthe left lobe of the liver with clear borders. A routine ultrasound\nexamination post-admission showed an irregularly shaped cystic lesion in the left lateral lobe of the liver, which was approximately 4.9 × 3.3 × 2.4 cm in size. Red and blue vortex signals\nwere observed in the cystic lesion on color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI)(Fig. 1). Further observations showed that the inner\ndiameters of the left portal and hepatic veins had widened. The\ncystic lesion was closely related to the sagittal part of the liver\nand continued through the left branch of the portal vein; a channel was shown to be connected to the medial branch of the left\nhepatic vein. The channel predominantly showed blue-colored\nblood flow signals under CDFI, suggestive of a venous spectrum\nwith a flow rate of approximately 50 cm/s. The 2-dimensional\nultrasound and color Doppler ultrasound findings were as follows: blood flow signals were noted in the cystic lesion, which\nnegated the previous diagnosis of liver cysts; one end of the cystic lesion was connected to the sagittal part of the portal vein,\nand the other end was connected to the left medial branch of the\nhepatic vein. Further microvascular imaging confirmed that the\nblood flow in the cystic echo was connected to the left branch\nof the portal vein and the medial branch of the left hepatic vein\n(Fig. 2).\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound was performed to better\ndelineate the lesions and determine the patient’s condition.\nThe results showed that the intrahepatic cystic lesions did\nnot enhance during the arterial phase. At the portal vein\nstage (22 s), enhancement began to appear around the lesion.\n\nFigure 1. A color Doppler showed a cystic hepatic lesion with blood flowing through a channel to the medial branch of the left hepatic vein.\n\n2\n\n\fLiu et al • Medicine (2022) 101:37\bwww.md-journal.com\n\nFigure 2. Microvascular imaging demonstrated the passage between the cystic lesion and the left hepatic vein.\n\nFigure 3. In both the portal vein stage and the delayed stage, the cystic lesion was found to communicate with multiple channels in the left hepatic vein.\n\nA single imaging modality has limitations in diagnosing diseases, especially rare and complex ones.[7] Several factors influenced the diagnosis in this case, such as the nature of the internal\nblood flow (arterial or venous), source of blood flow, presence\nor absence of shunts, and the course, number, and location of\nshunts. Hence, we used multimodal imaging to confirm the diagnostic results in this case. Color Doppler ultrasound can macroscopically detect abnormal tortuous blood vessels or irregular\ncystic lesions in the liver.[8] In the case of hepatic cystic lesions,\nan ultrasound can easily and quickly display the internal blood\nflow, identify cysts and arteriovenous aneurysms, and determine\nwhether arterial or venous blood flow is present.[9] In this patient,\nan ultrasound examination after admission showed an irregularly shaped cystic lesion in the left lateral lobe of the liver, in\nwhich red and blue eddy current signals were seen. The cystic\nlesion was closely related to the sagittal part of the liver and\n\ndischarge. The physician instructed the patient to undergo\nan ultrasound every 3 months; however, the patient did not\nreturn for the ultrasound examination because of her old age\nand limited mobility. The patient was asymptomatic during\n4 telephonic follow-up evaluations. The treatment plan was\nto continue closely observing her condition. This study was\napproved by the ethics committee of the First Central Hospital\nof Baoding. The patient provided written informed consent for\nthis study.\n\n3. Discussion\nPortal vein tumors combined with a congenital portosystemic\nvenous shunt are extremely rare. This case was diagnosed as\nPVA with a portosystemic venous shunt using multimodal\nimaging.\n3\n\n\fLiu et al • Medicine (2022) 101:37\bMedicine\n\naddition, 3-dimensional ultrasound research can be added to\nprovide a basis for the differential diagnosis of portosystemic\nvenous shunt.[17] If the blood flow through the shunt is small,\nclinical observation may be performed, and only symptomatic\ntreatment may be administered when required. If the blood flow\nthrough the shunt is significant, further interventions such as\nsurgery or interventional therapy can be used.\n\ncontinued with the left branch of the portal vein, a channel communicating with the medial branch of the left hepatic vein, and\nwas dominated by a blue festoon blood flow signal, suggestive of\na vein-like signal spectrum. A previous study showed that portal hypertension is the leading cause of acquired PVA.[1] Iwao et\nal found that a portal venous velocity of 13 cm/s, hepatic arterial pulsatility index of 1.1, and liver vascular index of 12 cm/s\nwere the best cut-off values for the ultrasound diagnosis of portal hypertension.[10] Pulsed-wave Doppler can not only evaluate\nthe direction of blood flow but can also estimate the flow rate\nto determine the diversion rate.[11] In our case, the connection\nbetween the portal and hepatic veins was clearly shown by\ncolor Doppler ultrasound, which showed that the flow velocity\nof the shunt vessels in the portal vein increased with the resistance index, and turbulence was visible at the connection site.\nMicrovascular imaging using the new algorithm can provide a\ndifferential diagnosis for liver lesions by reducing the influence\nof fluctuating clutter and eventually increasing the rate of blood\nflow signal detection at low speeds.[12] Multiple channels from\nthe cystic lesion were observed connecting different branches of\nthe left hepatic vein, and low-velocity blood vessels were also\ndiscovered by microvascular imaging in our patient, which could\nnot be displayed by the conventional color Doppler ultrasound.\nOn a contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan, a branch of the portal\nvein and the hepatic vein could be seen communicating through\na tubular or tumor-like structure during the portal venous phase,\nwith early and heterogeneous enhancement in the hepatic vein,\nand transient, non-specific, and homogeneous relative enhancement during the portal venous and delayed phases. Congenital\nportosystemic shunt results in accelerated portal-hepatic circulation time on contrast-enhanced ultrasound scans. In addition,\ncontrast-enhanced ultrasound technology effectively identifies\nportal vein tumors.[13] Using this technology, the time of arrival of\nthe contrast agent to the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic\nvein (HVAT) were recorded. The time interval for the arrival of\nthe contrast agent from the hepatic artery to the hepatic vein\n(HA-HVAT) and the transit time for the contrast agent to reach\nthe hepatic vein from the portal vein (PV-HVTT) was calculated.\nA congenital portal-systemic venous shunt can accelerate the circulation time of the portal and hepatic veins and shorten the\nHVAT, HA-HVAT, and PV-HVTT.[3,4] Some patients can be diagnosed with a congenital portal-systemic shunt through prolongation of the hepatic vein imaging phase when no clear connection\nlesions are seen.[14] Multimodal imaging techniques helped perform a detailed analysis of the case, which led to an accurate\ndiagnosis of the disease. Multimodal imaging examinations are\nsignificant for early clinical detection, diagnosis, and treatment\nof PVA and portosystemic venous shunt.\nA portal vein diameter > 1.9 cm in cirrhotic patients or 1.5 cm\nin normal livers is defined as PVA.[1] PVAs are easily misdiagnosed as hepatic cysts, intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, and\nintrahepatic arteriovenous fistulas.[1] Therefore, during the\nimaging process, it is necessary to continuously scan multiple\nsections, carefully analyze the blood flow spectrum, accurately\ndetermine the source of blood supply and classification, and\navoid misdiagnosis.[15] Most patients with a PVA undergo conservative management with close follow-up evaluations.[1,2,16]\nDue to the long-term presence of an abnormal anatomic structure typical of a portosystemic venous shunt, patients are at risk\nof significant medical complications such as bleeding, pulmonary hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy.[3] If the shunt\ncauses symptoms, an active management approach such as ligation or embolization should be adopted.[3] Rigorous and detailed\nimaging examinations are also needed to evaluate the anatomic\ncharacteristics and location of the shunt.[7–15] Multimodal imaging techniques, such as color Doppler ultrasound, micro-flow\nimaging technology, contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have become\neffective tools for diagnosing portosystemic venous shunts. In\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, this case demonstrates that sonographers should\nevaluate the patient’s medical history for indications of PVA\nand intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt while considering the differential diagnoses for hepatic cystic lesions. During\nthe examination, multiple sections were scanned to analyze the\nsource of blood flow, presence or absence of shunts, and the\npath, number, and location of shunts to prevent misdiagnosis\nand formulate a reasonable treatment plan for patients.\nThe lessons from this case were, first, ultrasound can easily\nand quickly identify hepatic cysts and arteriovenous aneurysms\nand assess the internal blood flow. The nature of the blood\nflow can be determined to be arterial or venous. Second, timely\napplication of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and microvascular\nimaging techniques can determine the source of blood flow, the\npresence or absence of a shunt, and the shunt’s course, number,\nand location.\n\nReferences\n[1] Laurenzi A, Ettorre GM, Lionetti R, et al.
