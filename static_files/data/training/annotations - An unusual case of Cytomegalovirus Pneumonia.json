He developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was intubated 13 days after\r\npresentation, but developed refractory hypoxemia requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\r\n(cannulated 16 days after presentation). He received a 5-day course of remdesivir and 10 days of dexamethasone 6 mg daily. His\r\ncourse was complicated by acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, septic shock due to a pseudomonal\r\nventilator-associated pneumonia, right ventricular failure, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and right pneumothorax requiring\r\nchest tube thoracostomy. After 4 weeks of ECMO there was lung recovery with ECMO sweep gases <1L/minute, improved\r\nradiographic appearance and tidal volumes, and decannulation was anticipated. However, he subsequently developed profound\r\nshock of unknown etiology with a rapid worsening of his lung function requiring increased ECMO support. Care was withdrawn\r\nat ECMO day 46 due to multiorgan failure. Pathology of his lungs at autopsy showed prominent intranuclear viral inclusions and\r\npositive immunohistochemistry in alveolar macrophages consistent with a diagnosis of CMV pneumonia.\r\nDISCUSSION:WhileCMVtypically causes latent disease it can reactivate inthe setting of immunosuppression and/or critical illness.[1]\r\nPatients with severe COVID-19 frequently are treated with immunosuppressive therapies, such as corticosteroids, anti-interluekin-6\r\ntherapies, and JAKinhibitors.Due to this immunosuppression, opportunistic infections have been reported in these patients.[2] It can be\r\ndifficult to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other respiratory infections based on imaging and lab studies alone, especially in\r\npatientswith prolongedmechanical ventilation andwith severe parenchymal disease requiringECMOsupport. Little is known about the\r\nincidence of CMV and COVID-19 coinfection. There are several cases of biopsy-proven CMV pneumonia in immunocompromised\r\ncritically ill patients with COVID-19, but this is the first reported case in an immunocompetent patient.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need to maintain a high degree of suspicion for CMV pneumonia in patients with\r\nsevere COVID-19 pneumonia who receive immunosuppressive therapies. While the diagnosis was made at autopsy in this case, it\r\nmay be possible to arrive at an earlier diagnosis with CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays sent from the serum and\r\nbronchoalveolar lavage (as lung biopsies are usually impractical in ARDS).\r\nReference #1: de la Hoz RE, Stephens G, Sherlock C.
