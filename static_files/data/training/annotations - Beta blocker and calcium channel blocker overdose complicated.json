She had also been experiencing shortness\nof breath and lower extremity pain for several days. Upon arrival, she was lethargic and minimally responsive, and was found to\nbe in shock with a heart rate 63. She was intubated for airway protection and started on multiple vasopressors including\nnorepinephrine, phenylephrine, vasopressin, dopamine and epinephrine for circulatory support. She was also found to be positive\nfor SARS-CoV-2. She was given activated charcoal, received gastric lavage, and whole bowel irrigation. She received a bolus of\nregular insulin at 1U/kg, and subsequently started on a high-dose insulin infusion titrated to 11U/kg/h along with dextrose\ninfusion and calcium gluconate. By day four of admission, vasopressor requirements had been reduced to only norepinephrine\nand the insulin infusion had been successfully discontinued. However, her hospital course was further complicated MRSA and\nPseudomonas pneumonia, and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. She continued to develop refractory shock, and remained\nover 50 liters net positive. Her condition progressively deteriorated and her gross volume overload was difficult to manage, and\nultimately expired on day ten of admission.\n\nDISCUSSION: The management of CCB and BB overdose has been studied, with hyperinsulinemic euglycemic therapy (HIET)\n1,2 as our choice. Our patient's decline was likely secondary to the high volumes of dextrose infusion required after HIET. With\nunderlying renal failure, insulin clearance proved to be a significant challenge. Such severe obesity with a weight-based regimen\nresulted in over 1500U insulin/hr at any given point with our patient. Renal clearance is governed by a proportion of t/V, where t\ndenotes length of a dialysis session and V the volume of fluid in the patient's body.3 Patients with significant volume would\nrequire extensive dialysis sessions and fluid balances would be challenging. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was\nattempted later in her hospital course. However, the patient was not able to tolerate it as she had progressed to multiorgan failure.\nCONCLUSIONS: HIET has shown to be a successful management strategy for CCB and BB overdose. However, weight-based\ndosing can prove to be a challenge in patients with severe obesity. CRRT should be considered early in severely obese patients that\nundergo HIET, given the rapid accumulation of fluid secondary to the large-volume insulin and dextrose infusions. Further\ninvestigations should look into identifying maximal safe dosages of HIET, especially in severely obese patients.\n\nReference #1: Cole JB, Arens AM, Laes JR, Klein LR, Bangh SA, Olives TD.
