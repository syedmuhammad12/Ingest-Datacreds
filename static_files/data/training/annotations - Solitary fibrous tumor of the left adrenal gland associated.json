They are commonly located in the pleura, meninges, or extremities; however, they can be found in any anatomical region associated with soft tissues and viscera. Of all these tumors, only less than 5% manifest with episodes of hypoglycemia2,3, a paraneoplastic syndrome first described by Doege and Potter in 19304,5.\r\nWe present a case of a solitary fibrous tumor dependent on the left adrenal gland, associated with Doege-Potter syndrome.\r\nClinical case\r\n71-year-old male with a 15-year history of systemic arterial hypertension, controlled with valsartan and amlodipine, and a 15-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed with sitagliptin and metformin, which were discontinued due to episodes of syncope and diaphoresis attributed to hypoglycemia. Because of this, the patient consulted with his physician after 2 months of episodes of loss of alertness on multiple occasions, accompanied by diaphoresis, polydipsia, anxiety and night sweats. During the episodes, blood glucose was measured at about 40 mg/dL, responding to consumption of hypercaloric foods. In conjunction with this, the patient complained of dyspnea on slight exertion, abdominal distension and pain, dizziness, muscle weakness and involuntary weight loss of approximately 12 kg in the previous year. A CT scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast was performed, showing a 22 × 17 × 20 cm tumor of the left adrenal gland of solid appearance, exerting displacement of the spleen, stomach, and pancreas, as well as on the corresponding kidney (Fig. 1). No data suggestive of peripheral infiltration were observed. Laboratory tests performed prior to surgery showed a blood glucose of 44 mg/dL (76-106), serum insulin < 1.0 IU/mL (2.3-26), C-peptide 0.2 mg/mL (0.78-5.19), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) 52.80 ng/mL (35.1-216), insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) 220 ng/mL (267-616) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3\r\n \r\nFigure 1. Computerized tomography of the abdomen in which a tumor is observed in the upper pole of the left kidney. A: coronal section. B: axial section.\r\n(IGFBP3) of 1.1 mg/L (2.5-5-7). Tumor resection was performed through an open approach, using a wide left subcostal incision. No infiltration of surrounding structures, such as the pancreatic tail or the transverse colon, was found. Splenectomy was required as part of the en bloc resection. The tumor removed weighed 3943 g and measured 23.7 × 20.2 × 13 cm (Fig. 2). The diagnosis of fibrous solitary tumor of the left adrenal gland was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, resulting in strongly positive staining for vimentin, CD99, BCL-2, STAT6 and CD34. The patient progressed favorably after surgery, without incidents, with complete remission of the hypoglycemic episodes from the first day after surgery. He was discharged on the fifth day after surgery, with no complications.\r\nDiscussion\r\nSolitary fibrous tumors are a group of rare mesenchymal-like tumors originating from fibroblasts and myofibroblasts commonly located in the visceral pleura, accounting for less than 2% of all soft tissue masses1. They were initially described by Klemperer and Rabin in 19316 in a tumor of pleural origin. These tumors are categorized as having intermediate biologic potential, with a low risk of metastasis, and a relatively indolent clinical course according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification 20027.\r\nThese lesions have histological features that overlap with those of other soft tissue tumors. They typically consist of bipolar spindle cells or ovoid shaped cells in a stroma of abundant collagen and high vascularization,\r\n \r\nFigure 2. Resected tumor (left) and resected spleen (right).\r\nin a pattern similar to that of hemangiopericytomas8. In the immunohistochemical study they are positive for vimentin, CD34, CD99 and BCL-28-10. Additionally, it has been shown that solitary fibrous tumors are characterized by an inversion-type rearrangement mutation in 12q13-15, thus generating the fusion of NAB2-STAT6 genes, and thus leading to the overexpression of the STAT6 protein11,12. Currently, the WHO classifies them as soft tissue tumors7.\r\nSolitary fibrous tumors can be found in any anatomical region, with intrathoracic location being the most common, followed by intraabdominal location13,14; however, they have been described elsewhere, such as in the head, neck, mediastinum, pelvis, and retroperitoneal location, which is the most infrequent10,15,16. Solitary fibrous tumors in the mediastinum, abdomen, retroperitoneum, and pelvis tend to behave more aggressively14.\r\nTheir distribution is similar between men and women, they appear in adults of all ages (generally between the fifth and sixth decades of life), and are more common in the Caucasian population, followed by Hispanic, Asian and finally African American17. \r\nSolitary fibrous tumors can sometimes manifest first as paraneoplastic syndromes, with treatment-refractory hypoglycemia being the most common. This phenomenon is described as non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH)18. When the solitary fibrous tumor is accompanied by hypoglycemia, it constitutes the Doege-Potter syndrome, first described in 19304,5. It occurs in less than 5% of all cases and is seen primarily in large pleural and retroperitoneal tumors2,3. Doege-Potter syndrome is characterized by refractory hypoglycemia, with decreased serum levels of insulin, C-peptide, and growth hormone, as well as low serum IGF-I levels versus IGF-II levels that may be normal or elevated19.\r\nThe main cause of this type of hypoglycemia is tumor production of IGF-II, a 7.5 kDa peptide20-22, resulting in stimulation of insulin receptors (IR-A) and increased cellular glucose use. Under normal conditions, IGF-II circulates in a 150 kDa complex consisting of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP3, and may be associated with the acid-labile subunit23. IGFs are a family of peptide hormones and growth factors that include insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II, and have at least 50% of the amino acids in common with insulin24. The relationship between IGF-II and NICTH was identified by Daughaday in 198825 in a patient with hypoglycemia and with fibrosarcoma, whose expressed IGF-II mRNA and IGF-II peptide values were very high.\r\nIn NICTH, elevated IGF-II levels are a consequence of tumor overexpression of IGF-II mRNA, which further leads to immature precursors of IGF-II, big IGF-II, and pro-IGF-II, which may also interact with tissue insulin receptors26. It has been reported that the pathophysiology of NICTH follows a dual mechanism: increased cellular glucose use mediated by IGF-II, big IGF-II or pro-IGF-II, and growth hormone inhibition, which reduces hypoglycaemia counter-regulation19,26,27. However, IGF-II has been reported to be expressed in 80% of solitary fibrous tumors even with elevated IGF-II mRNA values19. Although serum IGF-II levels may be elevated in these patients, they are often normal in number, as in our patient; however, big IGF-II and pro-IGF-II measured by Western blot assay values are elevated in cases of NICTH, which would explain the source of hypoglycemia in patients with low or normal IGF-II values, or it could simply be attributed to the glucose uptake by the tumor26-28.\r\nThe initial treatment should consist of increasing oral and intravenous glucose intake to avoid hypoglycemia. The use of glucagon, growth hormone and glucocorticoids has been reported19,29. Surgical treatment remains the definitive management for this disease, but recurrence has been reported up to 20 years after surgery30; overall, progression without metastasis at 5 and 10 years is 74% and 55%, respectively, while 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates are 89% and 73%. Patient age, tumor size, and mitotic index are predictors of time to metastasis and to disease-specific mortality, while necrosis predicted only metastasis17. Although most solitary fibrous tumors are usually benign, 15% to 20% are aggressive and eventually recurrent31.\r\nConclusions\r\nDoege-Potter syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by severe treatment-refractory hypoglycemic events accompanied by a solitary fibrous tumor. There should be clinical suspicion when faced with a patient with a history of hypoglycemia that is difficult to control, as this suspicion may lead us to find the underlying cause. Curative treatment of solitary fibrous tumors and Doege-Potter syndrome continues to be surgical resection, although it can be initially supported by increasing oral or intravenous glucose intake.\r\nEthics responsibilities\r\nProtection of humans and animals.
