It occurs mostly\nin immunocompromised patients as opportunistic infections\nbut can appear in otherwise healthy individuals [1]. Nocardia\ninfection can occur via inhalation or direct inoculation, causing primary pulmonary or cutaneous disease, respectively [1].\nInvolvement of other sites, such as the CNS, develops mainly\nby hematogenous dissemination [2].\nA Nocardia brain abscess in patients with multiple myeloma is\nextremely rare. In the few reported cases in the literature, acquisition of this infection in such patients was in association\nwith the use of novel therapeutic agents (eg, bortezomib and\nlenalidomide) or bone marrow transplantation, which impairs\ncell-mediated immunity, an important host defense against the\ninfection [3-8]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nreported case of Nocardia brain abscesses in a multiple myeloma patient without any of the above reported risk factors.\n\nCase Report\nA 44-year-old woman was transferred to our Neurosurgical Unit\nfrom the Intensive Care Unit of Kuwait Cancer Control Center.\nHer past medical history was significant for diabetes, hypertension, and hysterectomy 6 years earlier, which was due to\ndysfunctional uterine bleeding. A year prior to her current presentation, she reported having persistent back pain, and further assessment revealed a stable L3 fracture. On further investigation, multiple myeloma (IgG kappa type; International\nStaging System-IIa) was diagnosed 8 months prior to her current presentation. The patient was started on cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone and zoledronic acid.\nHer condition improved after the third cycle, and she declined\nto undergo bone marrow transplant assessment. She was not\non any prophylactic antibiotics. Two months earlier, she developed a subcutaneous abscess on the left thigh, for which\nshe underwent incision and drainage. Results of the cultures\nrevealed mixed bacterial growth without isolating a specific\npathogenic strain. Five days prior to transfer, the patient presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which were difficult to control. As a result, she was sedated, intubated, and\nventilated. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed 3 space-occupying\nlesions: multi-compartment left deep frontal (4.6×3.8×3.2 cm),\nleft parietal (1.2×2.2×3 cm), and right parietal (1.6×1.3×1.5 cm)\n(Figure 1). These lesions were cystic, with clear margins, and\ntheir walls were contrast-enhancing and surrounded by extensive edema, causing significant mass effect and midline shift.\nCervical spine MRI and chest X-ray were normal. Thoracic and\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Common AttributionNonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n\nlumar spine MRI were only significant for several lytic lesions\nand fractures involving the thoraco-lumbar vertebrae, due to\nmultiple myeloma.\nDespite normal inflammatory markers and the fact that the radiological findings were interpreted as multiple brain metastasis, the patient still received empirical treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin as a precaution in case\nthese lesions were found to be abscesses during surgery. At\nthe time of assessment, the patient’s body temperature was\n37.5°C, heart rate was 58 beats/min, and blood pressure was\n110/70 mmHg. The patient was sedated with remifentanyl, intubated, and ventilated. Despite the sedation, she was opening her eyes spontaneously and obeying commands (Glasgow\nComa Scale score was E4, VIntubated, M6). On further examination,\nthe patient was paraplegic (Medical Research Council [MRC]\npower scale 0/5 in both lower limbs) and had severe weakness\nin the upper limbs (MRC power scale 2/5 and 1/5 in the right\nupper limb and left upper limb, respectively). No sensory level was noted. Deep tendon reflexes were sluggish throughout.\nThe patient underwent left frontal craniotomy with total excision of the left frontal space-occupying lesions. Intraoperative\nfindings were conclusvie for the diagnosis of an abscess, and\nsamples were sent for microbiology and histopathological assessment. Micropscopy and staining revealed slender, branching, gram-positive bacilli, which were weakly acid-fast and morphologically resembling Nocardia. The organism were cultured\non blood and chocolate agar under aerobic conditions at 37°C.\nColonies were visible at 48 h, but were left to grow for a total\nof 10 days. Identification of Nocardia farcinica took less than\n1 h and was done via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology using a\nVITEK MS machine. This was followed by antibiotic sensitivity testing (Table 1).\nThe left and right posterior fronto-parietal lesions were not\ndealt with because they were small and in eloquent areas.\nThe patient was extubated the next day, and the postoperative non-contrast CT scan of the brain showed the left frontal lesions appearing to be no longer visible (Figure 2). She\nremained at our neurosurgical institute for around 3 weeks\nbefore being transferred to the referring hospital to continue medical treatment. Prior to being transferred, the Glasgow\nComa Scale score was 15/15 and power in all limbs showed\ndiscrete improvement.\nThe antibiotic regimen was changed to intravenous meropenem, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 6 weeks,\nfollowed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 12 months,\nwith very good neurological status and recovery. To the best\nof our knowledge, no additonal abscess formation occurred.\n\ne937952-2\n\nIndexed in: [PMC] [PubMed] [Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)]\n[Web of Science by Clarivate]\n\n\fSayer K. et al:\nBrain abscesses caused by Nocardia farcinica\n© Am J Case Rep, 2022; 23: e937952\n\nA\n\nD\n\nB\n\nE\n\nFigure 1. \u0007T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of brain\nafter gadolinium administration revealed multiple\nring-enhancing lesions.

It is\na rod-shaped, partially acid- and alcohol-fast bacteria forming irregular branching colonies on agar [2-9]. Numerous species are defined, with some being nonpathogenic, and others\nresponsible for nocardiosis [10]. The pathogenic species have\nlow virulence, and disease most frequently occurs as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals with\ndefects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, organ transplant recipients and HIV-positive patients) [1,2,11-13]. However, infection\nof individuals who are immunocompetent is not uncommon,\nwith up to 60% of Nocardia infections occurring in immunocompetent hosts, and up to two-thirds of patients with CNS\ninfection not having predisposing risk factors [14-19]. Clinical\nmanifestations vary from pulmonary, lympho-cutaneous, and\ndisseminated nocardiosis with deep abscess formation at any\nsite and CNS involvement [2,10,20].\nTo date, this is the seventh reported case of Nocardia brain abscesses in a patient with multiple myeloma (Table 2) [3,4,6-8].\nMultiple myeloma has been reported to affect the humoral immunity more than the cell-mediated, while the medications\nused to treat it impair cellular immunity [5,6,21,22]. Previously\nreported cases have stated that the use of novel therapeutic\nagents (eg, bortezomib, lenalidomide) results in changes in\ncellular immunity, thereby increasing the risk of a spectrum\nof infectious agents, including Nocardia. In a different cohort\nof patients with CNS nocardiosis, an association with bone\nmarrow transplantation was reported [5]. In our case, neither\nbone marrow transplantation nor novel therapeutic agents for\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Common AttributionNonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n\nFigure 2. \u0007Postoperative non-contrast computed tomography of\nbrain showing left frontal craniotomy flap with left\nfrontal lesions appearing to be no longer visible.

Surgical packing and hematoma is seen\ninside the operative cavity (arrows).\n\nmultiple myeloma were implicated in the development of the\nNocardia brain abscesses. However, cell-mediated dysfunction due to cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, and dexamethasone therapy for multiple myeloma can also occur and hence\nmay have been a risk factor for the development of Nocardia\ninfection in this patient. Even though cellular immunity has\nbeen shown to be important in the host defense of patients\nwith Nocardia infection, the humoral immunity also appears\nto play a major significant role in the host defense against the\ninfection [23]. Our patient had IgG kappa multiple myeloma,\nwhich is known to have increased risk of defective antibody\nresponse and hence infection [24]. Therefore, we postulate\nthat the pathogenesis of cerebral nocardiosis in our patient\nmay also be directly related to the myeloma-associated humoral immunity dysfunction, and therefore this should not be\nruled out as a risk factor. Nevertheless, despite the severe immunodeficiency and higher risk of infections in patients with\nmultiple myeloma, the development of brain abscesses is reported to be extremely rare [4].\nNocardia brain abscesses are an uncommon entity, whereby\n25% to 40% of patients with systemic nocardiosis develop cerebral infection [9]. CNS infection can also be isolated without\nevidence of systemic disease, occurring in up to 40% of cases\n[25]. CNS involvement most frequently manifests as cerebral\nabscesses, although meningitis and diffuse cerebral infiltration have been reported [25,26]. These brain abscesses originate mainly from a primary focus, such as the lungs or skin,\n\ne937952-4\n\nIndexed in: [PMC] [PubMed] [Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)]\n[Web of Science by Clarivate]\n\n\fSayer K. et al:\nBrain abscesses caused by Nocardia farcinica\n© Am J Case Rep, 2022; 23: e937952\n\nTable 2.

Novel therapeutic multiple myeloma agents are highlighted in bold.\n\nand represent only 2% of all brain abscesses [15,27]. Patients\nwith CNS nocardiosis most commonly present with focal neurological deficits, non-focal findings, and seizures, as was seen\nin our case [28]. In addition, fever and signs of septicemia are\ngenerally absent [1]. CT and MRI findings can reveal single or\nmultiple contrast-enhancing lesions.\nIt is estimated that about 86% of all Nocardia infections in\nhumans are caused by Nocardia asteroides [2,12,16,17,20,29].\nInfection of the CNS can rarely be caused by N. cyriacigeorgica,\nbrasiliensis, farcinica [12,17,18]. In previously reported cases\n\nThis work is licensed under Creative Common AttributionNonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n\nof Nocardia brain abscesses in patients with multiple myeloma, the involved species were N. cyriacigeorgica, N. paucivorans, and N. farcinica, with N. farcinica being the most commonly reported [3,4,6-8]. N. farcinica infections are occuring\nmore frequently than previously recognized [9]. It may also be\nmore virulent than the other species and appears to possess\na high degree of antibiotic resistance; making treatment difficult [9,30]. This rare condition is often diagnosed late in the\ncourse of the disease due to the slow progression of symptoms\nand the lack of specific laboratory findings [31]. Furthermore,\nit is mostly misdiagnosed as neoplasm on imaging, which can\n\ne937952-5\n\nIndexed in: [PMC] [PubMed] [Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)]\n[Web of Science by Clarivate]\n\n\fSayer K. et al:\nBrain abscesses caused by Nocardia farcinica\n© Am J Case Rep, 2022; 23: e937952\n\nresult in delays in initiating appropriate antimicrobial therapy\nand surgical treatment [27,20,18]. This occurred in our case,\nwhereby the radiological findings were interpreted as multiple brain metastasis; this dilemma at presentation has been\nreported in other cases in the literature [16]. Difficulties in\nculturing Norcardia is another factor that results in a delay in\nreaching a diagnosis [28].\nThe optimal management approach for cerebral nocardiosis\nhas not yet been established. However, craniotomy and enucleation of the abscess followed by prolonged antimicrobial\ntherapy based on sensitivity results has been the preferred\ntreatment option and is associated with a lower relapse of infection and reduced mortality of 24% [17,20,27,28,32,33]. In\ncontrast, mortality rates with antimicrobial therapy alone and\naspiration alone were 30% and 50%, respectively [28].\nThe prognosis of cerebral nocardiosis carries a high mortality\nand morbidity among all brain abscesses [17,27,34]. A significantly higher mortality rate of 66% has been found in multiple\nNocardia brain abscesses compared to those with single lesions\n(33%) and other bacterial brain abscesses (10%) [16,28,32].\nWith the advent of newer generation antibiotics, the mortality has decreased from nearly 90% to 33% in single brain abscesses [16,35]. However, in the presence of multiple brain abscesses, the mortality still remains high, at 66% [16,35]. It has\nalso been reported that the mortality rates differ between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and are\n20% and 55%, respectively [18].\n\nConclusions\nNocardia brain abscesses are a rare encounter especially in patients with multiple myeloma. Published literature on the topic\nis scarce, consisting mainly of case reports. Its occurrence in our\ncase may hint toward myeloma-associated humoral immunity\ndysfunction, indicating the importance of the humoral immunity in the host defense against the infection. However, chemotherapy-induced cell-mediated dysfunction cannot be ruled out\nas a risk factor for the development of the infection in our patient. This report aims to raise awareness of the condition and\nadd pivotal data to the literature. In addition, it reiterates the\nimportance of considering the rare but life-threatening conditions as part of the differential diagnosis of brain lesions, especially when there is a misdiagnosis of the radiological findings, as occurred in this and previous cases in the literature.\nRecognition of cerebral nocardiosis requires a high index of\nsuspicion and early aggressive treatment with surgical enucleation of the abscess wall, prolonged antibiotics, and longterm surveillance, which are essential to prevent infection relapse, morbidity, and mortality.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to express our gratitude to the patient\nof this case report.\nDeclaration of Figures’ Authenticity\nAll figures submitted have been created by the authors who\nconfirm that the images are original with no duplication and\nhave not been previously published in whole or in part.\n\nReferences:\n1.
