Nocardia are responsible for opportunistic pulmonary infections\nespecially after steroid treatment. We describe a case of pulmonary nocardiosis following critical COVID-19 pneumonia in an 83-year-old\nmale. Two weeks after initiation of dexamethasone 6 mg/L, the patient developed a new episode of acute dyspnea. The sputum cultures\nidentified Nocardia cyriacigeorgica. In spite of intravenous imipenem and cotrimoxazole treatment the patient died. Physicians should be\naware of the possibility of nocardiosis in case of deterioration of respiratory status of severe COVID-19 inpatients and perform Nocardia\nevaluation. This evaluation requires prolonged culture.\nLEARNING POINTS\n• Nocardia are responsible for opportunistic pulmonary infections after steroid treatment.\n• We describe a case of pulmonary nocardiosis following critical COVID-19 pneumonia.\n• Physicians should be aware of the possibility of secondary nocardiosis in COVID-19 inpatients.\nKEYWORDS\nNocardia cyariacigerogica, nocardiosis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, opportunistic infection\nBACKGROUND\nNocardia are gram-positive bacilli responsible for pulmonary infections. They affect predominantly immunosuppressed patients with\ndeficient cell-mediated immunity, especially patients having had solid organ transplantation (SOT). Patients affected by solid or hematologic\nmalignancy or patients under immunosuppressive therapeutics such as steroids are also frequently affected. COVID-19 is a polymorphic\ndisease that mainly affects the respiratory tract. Occurrence of secondary bacterial pneumonia infections in COVID-19 has been estimated\nto be around 16% with gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia\namong others) or with gram-positive bacteria (mainly Staphylococcus aureus), less frequently (6%) with fungi (Aspergillus spp or Fusarium spp),\nand rarely with other opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii [1]. Despite extensive use of steroids and other immunosuppressive\ndrugs in COVID-19 treatment, four cases of nocardiosis during COVID-19 have been reported [2-5], of which two cases were suspected to be\npresent before COVID-19 infection. We describe a case of pulmonary nocardiosis following critical COVID-19 pneumonia in an 83-year-old\nmale suffering from COVID-19.\n\nDOI: 10.12890/2022_003477\n\nEuropean Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine © EFIM 2022\n\n\fEuropean Journal\nof Case Reports in\n\nInternal Medicine\nCASE DESCRIPTION\nAn 83-year-old HIV-negative male was hospitalized for deterioration of his general state and oxygen desaturation. Upon admission, a SARSCoV-2 PCR test performed in the emergency ward yielded a positive result. He had a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease (COPD) with bullous emphysema, noninsulin diabetes, and Crohn’s disease treated by mesalazine. He reported deterioration of\nhis general state with loss of appetite for more than a week prior to admission. Baseline hematology evaluation results were as follows:\nleukocytes, 6870/mm3; polynuclear neutrophils, 5320/mm3; lymphocytes, 730/m3; LDH, 345 UI/L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 142 mg/L; and\nprocalcitonin, 0.31 µg/L. A CT scan showed COVID 19 pneumonia with 25% of the pulmonary parenchyma affected, and major bullous\nemphysema mostly at the top of the lungs. The patient was treated with high-flow canula (HFCN), dexamethsone 6 mg/day, enoxaparin\n4000 UI, and cefotaxime and spiramycine. The course was favorable at first and the treatment was switched to conventional oxygen therapy\nand diminution of CRP on day 5 (12 mg/L). However, on day 4, the patient complained about a productive cough and a sputum culture was\nperformed. On day 13 after admission, he developed a new episode of acute dyspnea and fever with an increase in CRP level (177 mg/L,\nthen 428 mg/L two days later). A new CT scan (day 13) revealed dense consolidation with air bronchograms in the lower lobes of each\nlung (Fig. 1). The sputum culture from day 4 showed colonies with features of Nocardia species. Further analysis using mass spectrometry\n(MALDI-TOF, Vitek MS Plus, bioMérieux) and genotypic characterization with 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed the presence of\nNocardia cyriacigeorgica (Fig. 2). Nocardia was found a second time in a sputum culture on day 13. Cerebral MRI did not reveal cerebral\nnocardiosis. Intravenous imipenem (750 mg ×3/d) and amikacine were introduced immediately and replaced with imipenem (1000 mg ×4/d)\nand cotrimoxazole (800 mg ×4/d for a week then 800 mg ×3/d), but the patient’s status worsened, and HFNC was needed again. However,\nthe patient’s clinical status worsened and he eventually died one month after his admission.\n\nFigure 1.

Nocardia spp are thin, gram-positive bacilli widely\nfound in the environment. Contamination results mainly from inhalation or occasionally from skin or eye trauma. The most frequent organs\naffected are the lungs, resulting in chronic pneumonia or less frequently acute or subacute pneumonia. Extra-pulmonary localization is\noccasionally found in 20% of cases, especially in the central nervous system.\nThere are more than 109 species of Nocardia spp including 54 human pathogens [6]. Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, first described in 2001, accounts\nfor 25% of nocardioses. N. cyariacigerogica infection has been reported in patients with pulmonary diseases: COPD especially under\nglucocorticoid treatment, nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, bronchiectasis or\npulmonary sequestration.\nOnly four other reports of nocardiosis associated with COVID-19 have been reported to date. The first case occurred in a 63-year-old man\nwho presented with dyspnea several days after severe COVID-19 treated using dexamethasone and remdesivir [2]. In this case, pulmonary\nand neurological nocardiosis was diagnosed but due to preexisting lesions, the nocardiosis was thought to be present prior to the SARS-\n\nDOI: 10.12890/2022_003477\n\nEuropean Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine © EFIM 2022\n\n\fEuropean Journal\nof Case Reports in\n\nInternal Medicine\n\nFigure 2.

The second case occurred in a 45-year-old woman with a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19, nocardiosis, and untreated\nAIDS [3]. In our case, nocardiosis was not present upon admission although preexistent colonization of the respiratory tract could not be\nruled out. Arif et al. described the occurrence of a 61-year-old patient hospitalized for COVID-19 who developed a previously unknown\nnocardiosis at the end of a 10-day course of dexamethasone [4]. The fourth and last case was the fatal case of a 16 years old patient with\ncystic fibrosis and necrotizing pneumonia due to Nocardia farcinia diagnosed a few days after hospitalization for COVID-19. The patient was\ntreated with antibiotherapy and dexamethasone[5].\nNocardiosis is more frequent in males over 50 years. An immunosuppressed condition is found in most cases as well as pulmonary diseases\nsuch as COPD, alveolar proteinosis, and asthma or sarcoidosis [6, 7]. Thus, Nocardia is most frequently an opportunistic infection, and\nwidespread use of steroids in COVID 19 in conjunction with lung damage could be favorable factors. This is a similar condition to such as\nCOVID 19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). In our case, the nocardiosis onset was acute but the presentation of opportunistic\ninfection during COVID-19 can differ from the classical presentation, as reported in CAPA cases.\nMicrobiology-based diagnosis is based on isolation mainly from respiratory samples (such as broncho-alveolar lavage or sputum).\nMicrobiologists should be informed about of the possible presence of Nocardia in case of SARS-CoV-2 secondary infection, because\nprolonged culture for up to 3 weeks is required for identification although colonies may appear after two days [7].\nCONCLUSION\nPhysicians should be aware of the risk of secondary nocardiosis especially in cases of severe COVID-19, and they should prescribe relevant\nbacteriological examinations in case of secondary deterioration of respiratory status among COVID-19 patients, especially when secondary\ninfection is suspected.\n\nDOI: 10.12890/2022_003477\n\nEuropean Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine © EFIM 2022\n\n\fEuropean Journal\nof Case Reports in\n\nInternal Medicine\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nChong WH, Saha BK, Ananthakrishnan R, Chopra A.
