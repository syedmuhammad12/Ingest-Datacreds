One of\r\nthese metabolites is oxalic acid, which can combine with ionized calcium\r\nin plasma to form calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate precipitates in\r\nthe renal tubules and is thought to be the cause of ethylene glycol–induced\r\nrenal injury. The prominent metabolic acidosis is caused by\r\ncirculating glycolic acid [1].\r\nA conclusive diagnosis of EG poisoning involves the confirmation of\r\nEG presence in plasma (>0.10 g/L), but many medical institutions are\r\nunable to rapidly measure its blood concentration. This implies the need\r\nfor alternative and indirect diagnostic methods, which are based on the\r\neffects produced by the metabolism of EG. Early and transient osmolar\r\ngap, followed by high anion gap metabolic acidosis, calcium oxalate\r\nmonohydrate (COM) crystalluria and hyperoxaluria are among the most\r\nfrequently used surrogate methods if EG poisoning is suspected. Lactate\r\ngap is another frequent finding between different laboratory methods\r\nused for measuring lactic acid.\r\nEarly treatment with either ethanol or fomepizole antidotes, is\r\neffective and life-saving. Both antidotes act by preventing the formation\r\nof the toxic metabolite, glycolic acid, by inhibiting the enzyme alcohol\r\ndehydrogenase [2].\r\nPatients with EG poisoning are often treated in intensive care units.\r\nTreatment consists in correcting the metabolic acidosis with sodium\r\nbicarbonate (if the pH is less than 7.3), administration of the antidote,\r\nand intermittent haemodialysis to remove the toxic alcohol and its\r\nmetabolites in order to correct the metabolic acidosis. Intubation and\r\nventilatory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients, as\r\nmay hemodynamic support with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors\r\n[1].\r\nConventional methods used by emergency laboratories to visualize\r\nCOM crystals are based on optical microscopy with or without polarized\r\nlight or automated urine particle digital imaging devices. Clinical circumstances\r\nsurrounding this intoxication require rapid clinical and\r\nanalytical responses. When crystalluria is observed, no further complementary\r\nidentification tests are usually performed. However, this case is\r\nunlike other situations as unusual crystalluria is detected [3–5].\r\n* Corresponding author.\r\nE-mail addresses: jordi.puiguriguer@ssib.es (J.

Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria in ethylene glycol poisoning confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Clinica Chimica Acta. 2022;531:1-3 on 10 Oct 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from Spain and concerns a 34-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of lethargic, slow stimuli response, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis, drug level increased and drug poisoning associated with venlafaxine and clorazepate. The case presented was that of voluntary, self-harm poisoning in a patient who ingested two glasses of Ethylene glycol (EG), 6000 mg venlafaxine and 300 mg clorazepate with suicidal motivation. Upon arrival at the Emergency Department, 14 h after ingestion, the patient was lethargic with slow stimuli response, presenting hyperventilation (breath rate 26x’) and showing metabolic acidosis (arterial blood gases: pH 7.17 pO2 106, pCO2 17, BE –22, CO3H 6.2, lactate 1.96, anion gap 26.1). The patient was initially treated with 1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate and fomepizole, initial dose of 15 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min; 10 mg/ kg every 12 h in 30 min; switching to 10% ethanol 0.1 ml/kg/hour at 24 h due to depletion of fomepizole stock. The patient was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for continuous hemodiafiltration, which was maintained for 6 h, subsequently switching to intermittent haemodialysis. The initial serum EG concentration was 0.39 g/L (Headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, HS-GC-FID 7697A 7890B, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The concentration of venlafaxine + desvenlafaxine was 1331 ng/ml (reference values, 100–400 ng/mL) (Gas chromatography mass spectrometry, GC–MS 7890A 5975C, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Serial monitoring of EG (and venlafaxine + desvenlafaxine) concentrations, along with monitoring of serum creatinine was shown. After three days in the ICU, during which time the patient presented renal failure (maximum creatinine 2.33 mg/dl), the patient later recovered. The patient was then transferred to the psychiatric hospitalization ward and discharged from the hospital after 12 days without physical sequelae. Serum creatinine measured 97 days post discharge was 0.71 mg/dL. Patient urine samples collected at admission, with a pH of 5.0, and at 6 h post-admission, with a pH of 5.5 were analysed using an automated urinalysis system (Sysmex® UN-Series, UC-3500™ chemistry analyser, UF-5000™ Particle Analyzer and UD-10™ Digital Imaging Device). The Sysmex UD-10™ was a fully automated urine particle digital imaging device used to locate, digitally store, and display microscopic images captured from urine specimens. In the image of urine sample collected at admission, crystals compatible with calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) were observed from initial phases. Subsequently, these two urine samples were sent to the Laboratory of Renal Lithiasis Research at the University of Balearic Islands. Previously, they were passed through a 0.45 μm nylon filter and the sediment was dried in a test tube. The observation of the morphology of the crystals was carried out using a scanning electron microscope S-3400 N (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) by means of which the typical structures of COM crystals in oval or hourglass shape (typical epitaxial growth) and the presence of scarce envelope-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) were observed. A third urine sample, with a pH of 7.5, collected on the eighth day after admission, revealed negative urinalyses results and no abnormal scatterplot parameters warranting microscopic review were detected. The Hospital Ethics Committee approved the study, and the patient gave her informed consent for the study. The detection of crystalluria behaves as a urinary biomarker for several acute kidney diseases. COM crystalluria usually appears between 30 and 60 min after EG ingestion. For this reason, when it was rapidly identified, its presence indicates kidney injury and can guide therapy and aid in prognosis. While the presence of COD was related to urolithiasis pathology associated with high urinary calcium concentrations, and/or hypercalciuria but unrelated to toxicological pathology. The findings indicate that the scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the urine sediment was a useful methodology to confirm the composition of the crystals detected in EG poisoning. Finally, the detection of COM crystalluria was important in any patient with suspected EG poisoning, regardless of the availability to rapidly measure its concentration in blood and whenever possible, serial monitoring of crystalluria should be performed until the resolution of the case.
