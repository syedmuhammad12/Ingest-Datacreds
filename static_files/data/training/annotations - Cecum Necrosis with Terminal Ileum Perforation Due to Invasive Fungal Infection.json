The clinical manifestation is related to the site of infection. Gastrointestinal (GI) mucormycosis is a rare form of this disease, even in immunosuppressed\npatients.\nCase Presentation: We report rare cecum necrosis with terminal ileum perforation resulting from infiltration of mucormycosis\nin the cecum wall and terminal ileum mesentery in a patient with diabetes mellitus and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During\nchemotherapy for AML, the patient presented diarrhea followed by constipation, severe progressive abdominal pain, and fecaloid\nperitonitis. Perforation of the terminal ileum was observed during the surgery. Ileostomy, right hemicolectomy, and resection of\nnecrotic tissue were performed, and bowel mucormycosis was confirmed on histologic examination. Unfortunately, the patient\nexpired five days after surgery.\nConclusions: Gastrointestinal mucormycosis is an uncommon infection with symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,\nand melena. The mortality of GI involvement is due to perforation, peritonitis, and GI bleeding.\n\nKeywords: Gastrointestinal Mucormycosis, Ileocecal Perforation, Bowel Necrosis, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Diabetes Mellitus,\nImmunosuppression\n\n1. Introduction\nMucormycosis is a rare serious fungal infection associated with increased mortality. The incidence of mucormycosis has increased, especially in immunosuppressed\ncases, including patients with diabetes mellitus, hematological and solid organ malignancies receiving chemotherapy drugs, and patients receiving corticosteroids. The clinical manifestation depends on the site of infection, and the\nmost commonly infected organs are the sinus, brain, lung,\nand skin (1). A primary gastrointestinal (GI) mucormycosis is a rare form of this fungal infection reported only in\nseven percent of patients with mucormycosis (2). Here, we\npresent an ileocecal perforation due to mucormycosis in a\npatient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and acute\nmyeloid leukemia (AML).\n\n2. Case Presentation\n2.1. Before Surgery\nThe patient was a 56-year-old woman diagnosed with\nAML and admitted to the hospital for chemotherapy. Initial examination revealed blood pressure of 135/90 mmHg,\npulse rate of 80 beats/minute, O2 saturation of 92%, and\nbody mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 . Past medical histories\nwere hypertension and diabetes mellitus. She received insulin, dexamethasone 8 mg, and chemotherapeutic drugs,\nincluding Cytosar and Idarubicin. The laboratory findings on admission are shown in Table 1. She presented\ndiarrhea without abdominal pain during chemotherapy,\nwhich was treated with diphenoxylate and loperamide.\nThirteen days after admission, she complained of no defecation lasting eight days, and a week later, the patient pre-\n\nCopyright © 2022, Author(s).

After 38 hours, she developed a poor general condition, abdominal guarding, and\nelectrolyte imbalance. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with IV contrast showed ileocecal necrosis with small bowel loop distention (Figure 1), so she was\ntransferred to the operating room.

Intraoperative Findings\nDuring surgery, fecaloid peritonitis with purulent secretion was seen in the abdominal cavity. Two separate perforations in the anti-mesenteric site of the terminal ileum\n(2 cm and 10 cm from the ileocecal junction) and cecum\nnecrosis were seen. According to cecal necrosis and terminal ileum perforation, a right hemicolectomy was performed, and an end ileostomy was created because of the\npatient’s hemodynamic instability. Immediately after the\noperation, the patient underwent broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic treatment with imipenem, vancomycin, and\ncaspofungin. Unfortunately, the patient died five days after surgery due to septicemia and multi-organ failure. The\nhistopathologic examination of the resected bowel confirmed necrotic tissue and revealed mucormycosis hyphae\n(Figure 2).\n\n3. Discussion\nMucormycosis (caused by organisms of the class Zygomycetes) is the third most important invasive fungal infection after candidiasis and aspergillosis in patients with\nhematological cancers and has emerged as a fatal infection\namong these patients (1). Several organs are targeted by\nMucormycetes, including the brain, lung, skin, kidney, and\nGI tract, resulting in devastating clinical long-term sequelae (2). The fungus spreads mainly by inhaling airborne\nspores, eating contaminated food, and using open wounds\nor skin cuts (3). The spores damage the endothelial cells\nand invade blood vessels leading to vascular thrombosis,\nperforation, bleeding, and tissue necrosis (1).\nGastrointestinal mucormycosis is an uncommon disease, even in immunosuppressed patients (2). The stomach\nis the most frequent GI organ affected by mucormycosis,\nfollowed by the colon and small intestine (4). The presenting symptoms of GI mucormycosis vary, and the most common one is abdominal pain. Nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, and melena are the other clinical manifestations of the disease (5). The mortality after GI involvement is often due to perforation, peritonitis, and GI bleeding (1).\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of mucormycosis are\nassociated with better outcomes and reduced mortality.\nMoreover, it may decrease the need for surgery and other\ncomplications (2). Stool antigen tests, tissue sampling during colonoscopy, and new molecular methods are the recommended diagnostic tools for mucormycosis (1). However, according to the low specificity of these methods and\nArch Clin Infect Dis. 2022; 17(2):e121127.\n\n\fEslamian M et al.\n\nFigure 1.

She was diagnosed with\nAML a month before surgery and received Cytosar, idarubicin, and dexamethasone 8 mg, which cause immunosuppression. The histopathological examination of the\ncolon and ileocolic vessels showed mucormycosis infection. Since the patient had undergone chemotherapy, the\nimmune system was suppressed, and the cecum region\nwas the site of injury and necrosis, typhlitis with mold\nsuperinfection was the patient’s first diagnosis. Unfortunately, the patient passed away five days after surgery because of septicemia due to bowel perforation. The coexistence of immunosuppressive diseases like diabetes mellitus and receiving corticosteroids in combination with\nchemotherapy drugs may increase the risk of mucormycosis. Therefore, more caution should be taken in administering these drugs to patients with underlying diseases.\nFootnotes\n\nmanuscript: G.G.D and M.R.R; Study supervision: M.G.\nConflict of Interests: The authors declare no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding/Support: There is no funding/support.\nInformed Consent: Written informed consent was obtained.\n\nReferences\n1.
