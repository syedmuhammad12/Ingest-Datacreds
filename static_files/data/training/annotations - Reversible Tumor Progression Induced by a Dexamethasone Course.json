Several studies have reported an association between the use of corticosteroids and\r\npoorer outcomes for patients treated with ICIs. However, it has been never established whether\r\ncorticoid-induced tumor progression under ICI treatment could be reversible. We report herein\r\ntransient tumor progression induced by dexamethasone for a patient treated with pembrolizumab\r\nfor metastatic bladder cancer. An 82-year-old man was treated with pembrolizumab as a second-line\r\ntreatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma with stable disease for 8 months as the best tumoral\r\nresponse. He experienced severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and was treated\r\nwith high-dose dexamethasone for ten days according to the RECOVERY protocol. Following\r\nthis episode, radiological CT-scan evaluation showed tumor progression. Pembrolizumab was\r\nmaintained, and subsequent radiological evaluation showed tumor shrinkage. This case highlights\r\nthat the antagonistic effect of glucocorticoids with ICI efficacy is transient and can be reverted when\r\ncorticoids are withdrawn. Clinicians should be aware that tumor progression in the context of the\r\nintercurrent use of systemic corticosteroids can be temporary and should be interpreted with caution,\r\nand ICI continuation could be considered for some patients. Insights: The antagonistic effect of\r\nglucocorticoids with ICI efficacy is transient and can be reverted when corticoids are withdrawn.\r\nTumor progression in the context of the intercurrent use of systemic corticosteroids can be temporary\r\nand should be interpreted with caution, and ICI continuation could be considered for some patients.\r\nKeywords: immunotherapy; immune checkpoint inhibitors; COVID-19; pseudoprogression;\r\ncorticosteroids\r\nDiagnostics 2022, 12, 1933. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12081933 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\r\nDDiaigangonsotsitciscs2 022022,21, 21,21, 9x3 F3OR PEER REVIEW 22 ooff 55\r\nFigure 1.

In April 2014, a 75-year-old man with a history of smoking (20 pack-years)\r\npresented with hematuria, which revealed an FGFR wild-type urothelial bladder carcinoma with\r\nlung metastases. The patient was also treated for hypertension and diabetes. He was treated with a\r\ncombination of gemcitabine–carboplatin as a first-line treatment between October 2014 and March\r\n2015 (n = 9 cycles). After a partial response (RECIST 1.1 criteria) was observed on CT-scan evaluation,\r\nhe was monitored without treatment. He relapsed in May 2018 and was rechallenged with\r\ngemcitabine–carboplatin (n = 4 cycles) until January 2019, when he achieved another partial response.\r\nFor the third relapse in October 2019, he was treated with six more cycles of gemcitabine–\r\ncarboplatin until February 2020, with stable disease as the best response. Tumor progression was\r\ndiagnosed in July 2020, and pembrolizumab at the dose of 400 mg (intravenous every 6 weeks) was\r\ninitiated on 6 August 2020, according to local guidelines. The patient had stable disease as the initial\r\nbest response. After eight months of stable disease with pembrolizumab, the patient experienced\r\nsevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and was admitted to the intensive care unit\r\non 29 March 2021. He was treated with oxygen (up to 12 L/minute without noninvasive ventilation)\r\nand 6 mg of dexamethasone per day for ten days according to the RECOVERY protocol [1]. The\r\nclinical evolution was favorable, with oxygen withdrawal and hospital discharge on 9 April 2021.\r\nPembrolizumab was resumed on 18 May 2021 after an interruption of ten weeks.

Timeline of TDM scan evaluation of the two target lesions according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.\r\nGlucocorticoids (GC) are among the most potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive\r\nagents. In severe COVID-19 infection, the host immune response is thought to play a key role in the\r\npathophysiology of organ failure, and the use of dexamethasone to mitigate inflammatory organs\r\nhas been shown to result in lower mortality [2,3]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as pembrolizumab\r\nhave been successfully developed for the treatment of various cancers and have been\r\napproved for several indications, including for bladder cancer. They potently restore exhausted Tcell\r\nfunctions and are activated at tumor contact [4]. Corticoids have multiple mechanisms and inhibit\r\nseveral lymphocyte activities, such as T cell differentiation, activation, and migration [5].\r\nTherefore, there is a strong rationale for pharmacological antagonism between corticoids and ICI.\r\nGCs could impair the antitumoral activity of ICI, and this negative pharmacological interaction also\r\nexplains their efficacy as a treatment for the immune-related adverse events induced by ICI [6].\r\nSeveral retrospective studies have reported a negative impact of the use of corticoids on the outcomes\r\nof patients treated with ICI [7–10], and this association was further confirmed in a metaanalysis\r\nof 4045 cancer patients [11]. Based on these findings, the EMA recommends avoiding the\r\nuse of systemic corticosteroids before starting pembrolizumab [12]. However, despite efforts made\r\nto limit confusion biases in these studies, the causality assessment of the negative impact of corticoids\r\nremains limited. In this case report, we demonstrate for the first time that the antitumoral\r\neffect of pembrolizumab can be temporarily antagonized by a strong course of GCs but that the\r\nantitumoral effect is later recovered and translated into tumor shrinkage and control. Of note, pembrolizumab\r\ncessation for 4 weeks compared to the classic scheme (10 weeks instead of 6 weeks)\r\ncould not explain tumor progression when taking the long-lasting effects of a pembrolizumab concentration\r\nseveral times above the inhibitory concentration 50 and treatment half-life (3 weeks) into\r\nconsideration [4]. Dexamethasone has a short half-life of fewer than three days, and no active concentration\r\nremains after two weeks. In our case, however, we observed tumor progression between\r\n40 and 100 days after dexamethasone cessation followed by tumor decrease. The direct antagonistic\r\neffect of GCs could not explain such a chronology. However, GCs have a pleiotropic impact on\r\ndifferent T cell populations and precursors and can regulate T cell trafficking, alter TCR repertoire,\r\nFigure 2.

The direct antagonistic effect of GCs could not explain such a\r\nchronology. However, GCs have a pleiotropic impact on different T cell populations and precursors\r\nand can regulate T cell trafficking, alter TCR repertoire, or modify thymic homeostasis, which could\r\nexplain the long-lasting and remnant antagonizing effects despite a short half-life [13]. Pseudoprogression\r\ncould be an alternative explanation for transient tumor progression, and is not an exceptional\r\nevent with urothelial cancer, with 1.5% to 17% of cases being treated with PD-1 inhibitors [14]. However,\r\npseudoprogression arises exceptionally after three months (late pseudoprogression), and no\r\ncases have been reported after 6 months of treatment for urothelial cancer or other tumor types [15,16].\r\nClassic pseudoprogression seems unlikely in this case, with one year of treatment before transient\r\nprogression was observed. However, we could not discard the late pseudoprogression induced by GC\r\ncessation followed by transient inflammation that led to tumor progression followed by a decrease\r\nin tumor size. Consequently, tumor progression in the context of the intercurrent use of systemic\r\ncorticosteroids should be interpreted with caution due to potential pharmacological antagonism,\r\nand ICI continuation should be considered for some patients. Tumor evaluation was carried out\r\naccording to RECIST 1.1 criteria. COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; PD: progressive disease\r\n(RECIST 1.1 criteria). The tumor progressed after a course of dexamethasone and later experienced\r\ntumor shrinkage that did not meet partial response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. PD: progressive\r\ndisease; SD stable disease.\r\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.G., B.A. and L.C.; investigation, P.G., B.A., J.B. and\r\nL.C.; resources, P.G., B.A. and L.C.; data curation, P.G., B.A., J.B. and L.C.; writing—original draft\r\npreparation, P.G., B.A. and L.C.; writing—review and editing, P.G., B.A., J.B., A.V., J.-P.S. and L.C.;\r\nsupervision, P.G., B.A., J.B., A.V., J.-P.S. and L.C.; project administration, P.G., B.A. and L.C.

The clinical evolution was favorable, with oxygen withdrawal and hospital discharge on 9 April 2021. Pembrolizumab was resumed on 18 May 2021 after an interruption of ten weeks. Radiological CT-scan evaluation on 18 August 2021 showed RECIST tumor progression with a target lesion sum of 53 mm compared to 43 mm (+23%) on nadir (4 March 2021).
