Recent data has suggested that combination therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir and baricitinib could decrease \r\nthe severity and length of illness in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2. However; the data regarding the safety and side effects related to this \r\ncombination therapy are limited to case reports. The purpose of this case report is to highlight a potentially life-threatening side effect of \r\none or all medications mentioned above.\r\nLEARNING POINTS\r\n• Current National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines recommend remdesivir for patients with a high risk of progression. In patients \r\nrequiring minimal supplemental oxygen, remdesivir or dexamethasone monotherapy is recommended, while in patients requiring high\u0002flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, dexamethasone monotherapy or dexamethasone plus remdesivir is recommended. Baricitinib \r\nor tocilizumab can be added in patients requiring oxygen supplementation. \r\n• Clinicians should be aware of transient leukocytopenia that can be induced with combination therapy of dexamethasone, remdesivir and \r\nbaricitinib during the early phase of treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients.\r\n• The evaluation approach for leukopenia should consider autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, infections, malignancy, and \r\nmedication and toxin exposure.\r\nKEYWORDS\r\nSAR-CoV-2 pneumonia, transient leukopenia, remdesivir, baricitinib, dexamethasone\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nSARS-CoV-2 patients experience a wide variety of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to severe illness, guiding therapeutic \r\nmanagement. The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which demonstrated \r\nthat a 10-day course of intravenous (IV) remdesivir in severe SAR-CoV-2 patients (SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level, mechanical ventilation \r\n(MV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) shortened time of recovery compared with placebo [1]. The second stage of ACTT-2 \r\nevaluated the outcomes of combination therapy using a 10-day course of remdesivir followed by a 14-day course of baricitinib, concluding \r\nthat baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status, \r\nnotably among patients receiving high-flow oxygen or non-invasive MV [2]. Following this data, the SAR-CoV-2 treatment protocol in \r\nEuropean Journal\r\nof Case Reports in\r\nInternal Medicine\r\nDOI: 10.12890/2022_003636 European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine © EFIM 2022\r\nhundreds of hospitals was changed to a 10-day course of IV remdesivir and dexamethasone and a 14-day course of oral baricitinib. However, \r\nthe data regarding the side effects of this combination therapy are limited to case reports[3]. This case report aims to highlight transient \r\nleukopenia as a potentially life-threatening side effect of this combination therapy.\r\nCASE DESCRIPTION\r\nA 50-year-old woman with a medical history of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, cerebrovascular stroke with no residual neurological \r\ndefects, coronary artery disease (CAD), mitral stenosis status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and metallic mitral valve \r\nreplacement, presented complaining of a 1-week history of fever, chills, haemoptysis and dyspnoea on exertion. On clinical examination, she \r\nwas febrile at 39.2°C, tachycardic with a heart rate of 115 beats/minute, tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 30/minute, and hypoxaemic \r\nwith oxygen saturation of 84% on room air with gradual improvement of her oxygen saturation after being placed on a 3-litre (l) nasal \r\ncannula. Her initial laboratory work-up showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11×103/ml and positive SAR-CoV-2 infection on reverse\u0002transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chest x-ray showed bilateral perihilar pulmonary infiltrates reaching along the pleura \r\nbilaterally, sparing the upper and lower lung zones (Fig. 1). \r\nFigure 1. Chest X-ray showing bilateral perihilar pulmonary infiltrates reaching \r\nalong the pleura bilaterally, sparing the upper and lower lung zones\r\nShe was commenced on combination therapy for SAR-CoV-2: per oral (PO) 4 mg of baricitinib, intravenous (IV) 200 mg of remdesivir, and 8 mg \r\nof dexamethasone. On hospital day 2, she received a second dose of baricitinib, remdesivir and dexamethasone. Follow-up laboratory work\u0002up revealed a WBC count of 7.0×103/ml. On hospital day 3, the patient’s WBC count significantly dropped to 0.8×103/ml, and remdesivir, \r\nbaricitinib and dexamethasone were held. Further laboratory work-up demonstrated a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate \r\n(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)), D-dimer [and \r\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH), while ferritin and rheumatological work-up was unremarkable. Peripheral blood smear showed normocytic/\r\nhypochromic anaemia and leukopenia. During the following days of hospital admission, her WBC count trended upward after the cessation \r\nof combination therapy, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Her symptoms also improved significantly, and she was weaned from oxygen and discharged \r\nto be followed on an outpatient basis.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSince the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, treatment modalities have been heavily researched. Although a definitive cure has not \r\nbeen established, treatment strategies are guided primarily by symptom severity. Studies such as ACTT-1 and ACTT-2 support the use of \r\ncombination therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir and baricitinib in patients who required hospitalization as it can help reduce the \r\nrisk of severe illness and recovery time, and accelerate clinical improvement [4, 5]. Current National Institutes of Health (NIH) treatment \r\nguidelines recommend that for patients who require hospitalization without supplemental oxygen, remdesivir may be considered in those \r\nwith a high risk of progression, while in patients requiring minimal supplemental oxygen, either remdesivir or dexamethasone monotherapy \r\nis recommended. Additionally, in patients requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (NIV), either dexamethasone monotherapy \r\nor dexamethasone plus remdesivir is recommended. Baricitinib or IV tocilizumab can be added in patients requiring oxygen supplementation. \r\nEuropean Journal\r\nof Case Reports in\r\nInternal Medicine\r\nDOI: 10.12890/2022_003636 European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine © EFIM 2022\r\nFigure 2. WBC count trend during hospital admission\r\nFor patients requiring MV or ECMO, dexamethasone plus IV tocilizumab is recommended if it can be given within 24 hours of admission [6].\r\nWe present a case of drug-induced acute transient leukopenia. There was a temporal relationship between medication exposure and the \r\nabrupt onset of acute leukopenia. Other causes of transient leukopenia such as viral infections, commonly infectious mononucleosis due to \r\nEpstein-Barr virus, or other viral infections such as cytomegalovirus, HIV and parvovirus B19, chronic bacterial infections, and inflammatory \r\nand autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis) were excluded [7].\r\nThe first evidence that combination therapy for SARS-CoV-2 can induce transient leukocytopenia was derived from a retrospective analysis \r\nthat included 12 SARS-CoV-2 patients requiring supplemental oxygen in the form of a nasal cannula, high-flow nasal cannula or MV treated \r\nwith combination therapy of dexamethasone, remdesivir and baricitinib. Leukocytopenia occurred within 24 hours in all 12 patients and \r\nresolved quickly even without medication discontinuation [3].\r\nAlthough the mechanism of transient leukocytopenia after combination therapy is unknown, several mechanisms have been proposed. \r\nFirst, the temporally abnormal distribution of leukocytes might be a potential cause considering that leukopenia occurred shortly after \r\nexposure. Second, as baricitinib is a reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2, which suppresses cytokine-induced phosphorylation \r\nof signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), it potentially induces short-term leukopenia. Finally, inhibition of STAT3 \r\nphosphorylation reduces intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, which might inhibit neutrophilic adhesion to blood vessel \r\nwalls and facilitate extravascular migration [3].\r\nCONCLUSIONS \r\nClinicians should be aware of transient leukopenia that can be induced with combination therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir and \r\nbaricitinib during the early phase of treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients.\r\n\r\nUnited States of America\r\nSullivan S, Leelaviwat N, Davalos J, Evans A, Abdelnabi M, Mittal N.
