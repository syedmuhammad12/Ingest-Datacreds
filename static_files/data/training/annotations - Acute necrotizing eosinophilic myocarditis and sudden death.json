According to the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were more than\n72,000 overdose deaths in the US (US), with 49,068 involving an\nopioid. Preliminary reports from states and cities indicate that\noverdose death rates are further increasing during the COVID-19\npandemic. The present study sought to evaluate the recent\ntrends in the severe outcomes to single substance opioid exposures (SSO) reported to the US poison centers (PCs).\nMethods: The National Poison Data System (NPDS) was queried\nfor all closed, human exposures to opioids from January 01, 2015\nthrough December 31, 2021 using the American Association of\nPoison Control Center (AAPCC) generic code identifiers. We identified and descriptively assessed the relevant demographic and\nclinical characteristics. Reports from acute care hospitals and hospital based EDs (ACHs) were evaluated as a subset. Trends in\nopioids exposure frequencies and rates (per 100,000 human\nexposures) were analyzed using Poisson regression methods.\nPercent changes from the first year of the study (2014) were\nreported with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals\n(95% CI).\nResults: During the study period, there were 458,285 toxic exposures to opioids that were reported to the PCs. The frequency of\nexposures decreased by approximately 28% (95% CI: 25.5%,\n30.4%; p < 0.001), and the rate of exposures significantly\ndecreased by 26% (95% CI: 23.2%, 31.7%; p < 0.001). Of the total\nopioids calls, the proportion of calls from ACHs was approximately 56%, with this trend remaining constant through the\nstudy period. Multiple substance exposures accounted for 51.7%\nof the overall opioids calls and 59.9% of calls from ACHs.\nApproximately 17% of the patients reporting opioids exposures\nwere admitted to the critical care unit (CCU), with 10% of\npatients being admitted to a psychiatric facility. Residence was\nthe most common site of exposure (88.3%), and 66% of these\ncases were enroute to the hospital via EMS when the PC was\nnotified. Cases were predominantly female (53.6%), with the\nmost common age group being 20–29 years (18.2%) followed by\n30–39 years (17.1%). Suspected suicides (33.2%) was the most\ncommon reason for exposure, followed by intentional abuse\n(20.3%), with exposures for both reasons being higher in cases\nreported by ACH. The proportion of cases reporting intentional\nabuse as the reason for exposure increased significantly during\n\n47\n\nthe study (12–22%). Major effects and moderate effects were\nseen in 11.6% and 23.2% cases, respectively. The case fatality\nrate was 1.3% and the proportion of fatalities increased significantly during the study period (491–792). The most frequently\nopioid was hydrocodone while benzodiazepines were the most\ncommonly reported co-occurring substances.\nConclusions: opioid exposures reported to the poison centers\nduring the study period decreased but exposures reported from\nACHs increased significantly.

Acute necrotizing eosinophilic\nmyocarditis and sudden death in a\npatient with metformin associated\nmetabolic acidosis\nCarin Malleya, Erin Grammb, Alek Adkinsa, William\nTrautmana, Matthew Scanlona, Michael Abesamisa\nand Anthony Pizona\na\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA;\nUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\n\nb\n\nBackground: Acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis (ANEM)\nis characterized by rapid onset of ventricular dysrhythmias, biventricular failure, and death. It is frequently associated with conditions that cause peripheral eosinophilia such as chronic\neosinophilic leukemia, parasitic infection, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. It is also associated medications\nincluding sulfonylureas, various antibiotics, and ACE inhibitors.\nWe present a case of fatal ANEM in a patient initially admitted\nafter an overdose of metformin, sitagliptin, empagliflozin, and\nsertraline. None of these medications have been previously\nlinked to eosinophilic myocarditis.\nCase report: A 33-year-old woman with past medical history of\ntype 2 diabetes on metformin, sitagliptin, glimepiride, and empagliflozin presented to a community hospital after an intentional\noverdose. Initially awake and alert, she reported ingesting\napproximately 100 g metformin and an unknown amount of sitagliptin, empagliflozin, and sertraline. Over several hours, she\nbecame increasingly hypotensive with a rising lactate despite\nfluid resuscitation. She suffered a respiratory arrest followed by\nan approximately 4-min ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest. She\nwas intubated and defibrillated with return of spontaneous cardiac activity. She was started hemodialysis (HD) for metformin\nassociated metabolic acidosis (MAMA). She continued to deteriorate with hypotension despite multiple vasopressors. Her echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of approximately 10%.\nHD was discontinued after approximately 1.25 h, and she was\ncanulated for peripheral veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation and transferred to a tertiary care center. On arrival\nto the tertiary care center, she had a lactate of 27.0 mMol/L. She\nunderwent 6.5 h of HD with improvement of her lactate to\n4.0 mMol/L and she was transitioned to continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Her urine liquid chromatography mass\nspectroscopy (LCMS) was positive for sitagliptin, caffeine metabolite or theophylline, nicotine metabolites, metformin, sertraline.\nShe continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia. On post-overdose day #2 a right axillary impella device\nwas implanted for left ventricular venting. On post-overdose day\n#4, she developed intracranial embolic infarcts and pulmonary\nemboli. She was made comfort care and expired. Autopsy results\nshowed extensive eosinophilic myocarditis with myocyte necrosis\n\n\f48\n\nABSTRACT\n\nconsistent with ANEM. Her metformin level drawn on arrival to\nthe tertiary care facility was 14 mcg/mL, consistent with MAMA.\nDiscussion: We present a fatal case of ANEM after an overdose\nof metformin, sitagliptin, sertraline, and empagliflozin. None of\nthese medications are known to be associated with ANEM and\nshe had not filled any prescriptions for ANEM associated medications within 24 months of her death. She did not have elevated\ncirculating peripheral eosinophils as would be expected in\npatients with a parasitic infection or malignancy as a cause of\nher ANEM. Finally, the rapid time course and associated overdose\nsuggest a drug related correlation.\nConclusions: This case highlights an extremely rare presentation\nassociated with an acute overdose of metformin, sitagliptin, sertraline, and empagliflozin which either caused ANEM or contributed to rapid decompensation of previously undiagnosed\nasymptomatic ANEM.\nKEYWORDS Metformin; myocarditis; ECMO\n\nmalleyck@upmc.edu\n\n95. Evaluation of virtual online\ndelivery of United Nations Office on\nDrugs and Crime (UNODC) national\ntraining on novel psychoactive\nsubstances (NPS) to healthcare\nprofessionals in Mauritius and the\nSeychelles during the COVID-19\npandemic\na\n\nb\n\nthey would prefer future training to be delivered in person or\nvirtually.\nResults: 32 and 24 attendees completed the pre- and post-training questionnaire respectively. Prior to the virtual training sessions, attendees had greater knowledge and confidence in\nmanaging acute controlled substances toxicity compared to\nacute NPS toxicity: Knowledge 2.9 ± 0.8-vs-2.3 ± 0.8, p < 0.001;\nConfidence 2.9 ± 0.9-vs-2.4 ± 0.8, p < 0.001. Following the virtual\ntraining sessions, there was a significant increase in the knowledge and confidence in managing acute toxicity related NPS; in\naddition due to the wider discussion of controlled substances,\nthere was also a significant increase in knowledge and confidence in managing their associated acute toxicity. Thematic\nreview of the qualitative free text responses on the impact of the\ntraining identified the following themes: (i) improve their ability\nto help people/clients:12 participants; (ii) improved/greater knowledge:8 participants; (iii) clinical management of drug issues:5\nparticipants; and (iv) educate others:1 participant. The majority of\nparticipants (19,79.2%) would have preferred this training to\nhave been delivered in person rather than virtually.\nConclusions: Virtual delivery of UNODC national training on\nacute NPS toxicity during the COVID-19 pandemic increases the\nknowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals on managing acute controlled substance and NPS toxicity. Despite this\npositive impact, attendees would still prefer to have training\ndelivered in person rather than virtually. As we recover from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, how training is delivered going forwards\nshould consider attendees preferences and not favour potentially\n“cheaper” virtual training.

Finally, the rapid time course and associated overdose\nsuggest a drug related correlation.\nConclusions: This case highlights an extremely rare presentation\nassociated with an acute overdose of metformin, sitagliptin, sertraline, and empagliflozin which either caused ANEM or contributed to rapid decompensation of previously undiagnosed\nasymptomatic ANEM.\nKEYWORDS Metformin; myocarditis; ECMO\n\nmalleyck@upmc.edu\n\n95. Evaluation of virtual online\ndelivery of United Nations Office on\nDrugs and Crime (UNODC) national\ntraining on novel psychoactive\nsubstances (NPS) to healthcare\nprofessionals in Mauritius and the\nSeychelles during the COVID-19\npandemic\na\n\nb\n\nthey would prefer future training to be delivered in person or\nvirtually.\nResults: 32 and 24 attendees completed the pre- and post-training questionnaire respectively. Prior to the virtual training sessions, attendees had greater knowledge and confidence in\nmanaging acute controlled substances toxicity compared to\nacute NPS toxicity: Knowledge 2.9 ± 0.8-vs-2.3 ± 0.8, p < 0.001;\nConfidence 2.9 ± 0.9-vs-2.4 ± 0.8, p < 0.001. Following the virtual\ntraining sessions, there was a significant increase in the knowledge and confidence in managing acute toxicity related NPS; in\naddition due to the wider discussion of controlled substances,\nthere was also a significant increase in knowledge and confidence in managing their associated acute toxicity. Thematic\nreview of the qualitative free text responses on the impact of the\ntraining identified the following themes: (i) improve their ability\nto help people/clients:12 participants; (ii) improved/greater knowledge:8 participants; (iii) clinical management of drug issues:5\nparticipants; and (iv) educate others:1 participant. The majority of\nparticipants (19,79.2%) would have preferred this training to\nhave been delivered in person rather than virtually.\nConclusions: Virtual delivery of UNODC national training on\nacute NPS toxicity during the COVID-19 pandemic increases the\nknowledge and confidence of healthcare professionals on managing acute controlled substance and NPS toxicity. Despite this\npositive impact, attendees would still prefer to have training\ndelivered in person rather than virtually. As we recover from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, how training is delivered going forwards\nshould consider attendees preferences and not favour potentially\n“cheaper” virtual training.

To address this,\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) organise\nnational training programmes for the healthcare professionals on\nthe clinical management of NPS toxicity. Prior to the COVID-19\npandemic, this would be delivered face-to-face. This study investigates virtual delivery of this training during the COVID-19 pandemic to a group of healthcare professionals in Mauritius and\nthe Seychelles.\nMethods: Three virtual online training sessions were delivered\nby a UK based toxicology expert to healthcare professionals\n(physicians, nurses, psychologists and other allied healthcare professionals) working in Mauritius and the Seychelles in November\n2021. Attendees completed a pre- and post-training questionnaire on their knowledge of and confidence in managing acute\ntoxicity related to controlled substances and NPS. This questionnaire Participants self-assessed using scale of 1–5 for each variable: Knowledge: 1 ¼ little knowledge to 5 ¼ very\nknowledgeable; Confidence: 1 ¼ little confidence to 5 ¼ very\nconfident. Pre-training controlled substances and NPS knowledge\nand confidence between were compared by a paired student ttest; pre- and post-training knowledge and confidence were\ncompared by unpaired student t-test. In the post-training questionnaire attendees also provided qualitative feedback on the\nimpacts of training to their future practice, and also whether\n\nBackground: The weight-based, symptom-producing dose of\nextended-release amphetamine products is not well defined. The\nobjective of this study was to describe the clinical effects developed after lisdexamfetamine ingestion to better understand what\ndose-response relationship poison centers can consider when\nestablishing referral guidelines.\nMethods: This retrospective, Institutional Review Board approved\nstudy analyzed patient cases within a statewide poison control\nsystem’s database between February 1, 2015 and November 1,\n2021 for single-substance ingestions of lisdexamfetamine in\npatients under age 17 evaluated in a healthcare facility. Chart\nnotes for each case were reviewed by a Clinical Toxicologist and\nan Emergency Medicine Pharmacy Resident. Cases were excluded\nif the dose, weight, or medical outcome were unknown, if the\npatient was not stimulant naive, if activated charcoal was administered, or if the reason for exposure was suspected self-harm.\nData points included age, sex, weight, dose, clinical effects, treatments performed, whether hospital admission occurred, and\nlength of stay.\nResults: A total of 458 cases were identified but only 20 cases\nmet inclusion criteria. Twelve cases (60%) developed minor\neffects. Lisdexamfetamine doses causing minor effects ranged\n\n\f",{"entities":[[0,3,"REPORTERTITLE"],[4,9,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[10,16,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[18,57,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[59,69,"REPORTERCITY"],[71,73,"REPORTERSTATE"],[75,77,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[79,81,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[103,377,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[403,636,"RESULTSTESTSPROCEDURES"],[660,684,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[706,724,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[726,737,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[739,757,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[759,779,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[781,805,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[807,836,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[838,858,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[860,902,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[904,918,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[920,938,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[940,963,"PATIENTDEATHREPORT"],[990,1032,"PATIENTDETERMINEAUTOPSY"],[1053,1067,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1069,1098,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1100,1123,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1125,1145,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1147,1167,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1169,1180,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1182,1200,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1202,1226,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1228,1270,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1272,1290,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1292,1310,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1323,1348,"TESTNAME"],[1350,1357,"TESTNAME"],[1360,1367,"TESTNAME"],[1369,1379,"TESTNAME"],[1381,1395,"TESTNAME"],[1413,1424,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1426,1439,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1441,1450,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1452,1462,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1484,1495,"CONCOMITANTPRODUCT"],[1505,1516,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1518,1531,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1533,1542,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1544,1554,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1556,1567,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"],[1585,1609,"DRUGINDICATION"],[1630,1653,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1655,1679,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1681,1723,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1725,1739,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1741,1761,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1763,1781,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1783,1794,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1796,1816,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1818,1836,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1838,1867,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1869,1887,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[7256,7267,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[7268,7273,"PATIENTSEX"],[7377,7410,"SERIOUSNESSHOSPITALIZATION"],[7420,7441,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[7622,7646,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[7713,7731,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[7767,7807,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[7927,7966,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[8071,8124,"TESTRESULT"],[8739,8763,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[8903,8932,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[8937,8954,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[8985,8993,"SERIOUSNESSDEATH"],[8994,9016,"PATIENTAUTOPSYYESNO"],[9017,9073,"TESTRESULT"],[9116,9192,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[9241,9251,"SERIOUSNESSDEATH"],[9479,9502,"SERIOUSNESSDEATH"]]}]]}
