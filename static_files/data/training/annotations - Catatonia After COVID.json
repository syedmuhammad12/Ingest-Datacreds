Ostroff, MD\r\nAbstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than\r\na hundred million people worldwide. In addition to the devastating number\r\nof deaths caused by this disease, it can cause significant morbidity in some\r\nsurvivors. The understanding of the morbidity associated with COVID-19\r\nis rapidly evolving. This report describes 3 cases of catatonia associated\r\nwith COVID-19. Catatonia is easily confused with other forms of delirium\r\nbut if recognized can be effectively treated.We hope that awareness gained\r\nfrom these cases would help clinicians better recognize and diagnose catatonia\r\nfollowing COVID-19 infection.\r\nKey Words: catatonia, COVID-19, ECT, SARS-CoV-2\r\n(J ECT 2022;38: e43–e44)\r\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the\r\nSARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\r\n2) virus, has thus far infected many millions of people over\r\nthe world and has had a drastic social and economic impact.\r\nAs medical knowledge has grown, it has become apparent\r\nthat COVID-19 has significant impacts on the brain. These neuropsychiatric\r\nsymptoms can include cognitive deficits (often described\r\nas “brain fog”), cerebrovascular events, encephalopathy,\r\nanxiety, depression, and psychosis.1 There is some case-report\r\nlevel evidence that the development of catatonia may be an additional\r\nrisk.2\r\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\r\nFifth Edition defines catatonia as the presence of 3 or more of the\r\nfollowing symptoms: catalepsy, waxy flexibility, stupor, agitation,\r\nmutism, negativism, posturing, mannerisms, stereotypies, grimacing,\r\necholalia, and echopraxia. Catatonia is a complex neuropsychiatric\r\nsyndrome that can be secondary to psychiatric illness ormedical condition.\r\nSome patients with catatonia respond to benzodiazepines, and\r\nelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is usually considered as the second\r\nline of treatment.\r\nCatatonia may often be confused with similarly presenting\r\ndisorders, such as delirium or akinetic mutism, resulting in underreporting\r\nof a treatable syndrome. It is crucial that cases of catatonia\r\nare recognized early and treated appropriately to avoid unnecessary\r\nmorbidity and mortality.We describe 3 cases of catatonia associated\r\nwith COVID-19 and each patient's treatment course.\r\nCASE 1\r\nA 36-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder, posttraumatic\r\nstress disorder, and chronic kidney disease presented with\r\nsuicidal ideation. She had no respiratory symptoms but tested positive\r\non a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Once admitted,\r\nshe was uncooperative with care and minimally verbal and had\r\nminimal oral intake. Her laboratory test resultswere unremarkable\r\nother than a low thiamine level, which was treated with intravenous\r\n(IV) thiamine. On day 3, she became obtunded with nystagmus,\r\nnot responsive to noxious stimuli. Computed tomography of\r\nthe head was unremarkable. Because of suspicion for catatonia,\r\nlorazepam challenge was done, and within 15 minutes, she was\r\nsitting up and speaking.At this time, shewas noted to display negativism,\r\nposturing, poor oral intake, mutism, and tachycardia, and\r\na presumptive diagnosis of catatonia was made. She was started\r\non lorazepam IVand valproate IV, which improved her oral intake\r\nand posturing.\r\nShe had no respiratory symptoms or elevation in inflammatory\r\nmarkers; thus, on day 14, shewas transferred to inpatient psychiatry,\r\nand her lorazepam was increased to 8 mg/d. She was also\r\ntreated with olanzapine to target underlying psychosis. Because of\r\nlack of improvement, a lumbar puncture was performed on day 31\r\nwith unremarkable results, including paraneoplastic and autoimmune\r\npanels. She did not show clear improvement until day 50\r\nand slowly began to be able to communicate verbally and have adequate\r\noral intake, and themutism, negativism, posturing, poor intake,\r\nand tachycardia resolved. She was continued on valproate\r\nand a standing dose of 6 mg of lorazepam and was discharged\r\nnearly 2 months after admission.\r\nCASE 2\r\nA 69-year-old woman with a history of bipolar II disorder\r\nwas hospitalized for 10 days due to COVID-19 pneumonia, treated\r\nwith remdesivir and dexamethasone and discharged to a rehabilitation\r\nfacility. Patient then developed an alteredmental status, became\r\nnonverbal and incontinent, and was transferred to our facility for\r\nfurther workup. Patient underwent an extensive workup, including\r\ncerebrospinal fluid with autoimmune and paraneoplastic panels.\r\nNo pathological findings were detected.\r\nDuring hospitalization, patient had waxing and waning of\r\nmental status and manifested paranoid thought content and auditory\r\nand visual hallucinations. COVID encephalitis and seronegative\r\nautoimmune encephalitis were both considered, and patient\r\nwas treated with a course of IV immunoglobulin without any\r\nnotable improvement.\r\nUpon initial psychiatric evaluation, patient was thought to\r\nhave delirium but subsequently showed signs of catatonia including\r\necholalia, staring, posturing, stereotypy, mannerisms, and\r\nnegativism. A lorazepam challenge was done, which produced\r\nimprovements in the posturing and stereotypy, and IV lorazepam\r\ntreatment was continued. Despite some improvement in\r\ncatatonic symptoms, her executive function remained poor, and\r\nshe additionally manifested a labile affect, pressured speech, hypersexuality,\r\nand poor judgment. Bitemporal ECTusing aMECTA\r\n5000Q device (MECTA Corporation, Tualatin, OR) with a pulse\r\nwidth of 0.5 millisecond was added with rapid and significant\r\nimprovement in executive function and mood symptoms for a\r\ntotal of 6 treatments. She was discharged on day 45 having returned\r\nto her baseline.\r\nFrom the Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New\r\nHaven, CT.\r\nReceived for publication June 3, 2021; accepted December 23, 2021.\r\nS.N. and J.C. contributed equally as co–first authors of the article.\r\nReprints: Robert B.

All rights reserved.\r\nCASE 3\r\nA 74-year-old man with a history of major depressive disorder,\r\ndiabetes mellitus, splenomegaly, and Barrett esophagus presented\r\nto our emergency room with a recent decrease in appetite,\r\nincreased fatigue, dysphoria, dyspnea, and cough and was diagnosed\r\nwith COVID-19.\r\nPatient was treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone. He\r\ndeveloped hyponatremia attributed to syndrome of inappropriate\r\nsecretion of antidiuretic hormone secondary to COVID pneumonia.\r\nPatient was later found to have increased opacities on\r\nchest radiograph, which was treated with antibiotics, and he was\r\ndischarged.\r\nPatient was admitted 3 days later because of suicidal ideation;\r\nhewas found with a suicide note, holding a knife to his wrist.\r\nPatient was only able to provide brief and vague responses to\r\nquestions. On subsequent days, he started to verbalize paranoid\r\nideation, endorsed auditory hallucinations, and had poor sleep.\r\nHe then started to become lethargic with poor eye contact. Lowdose\r\nsecond-generation antipsychotics were started for the patient.\r\nPatient then developed symptoms of catatonia, including negativism,\r\nstupor, mutism, and rigidity. A few hours after a lorazepam\r\nchallenge patient became responsive, able to converse and follow\r\ncommands, and denied any memory of the earlier events. Lorazepam\r\ntreatment continued, and ECTusing a MECTA 5000Q device\r\n(MECTA Corporation, Tualatin, OR) was initiated because of only\r\na partial response. He received a total of 8 bitemporal treatments\r\nwith a pulse width of 0.5 millisecond. Patient showed dramatic improvement\r\nand had remission of all catatonic and mood symptoms\r\nand was discharged after 16 days.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCatatonia has been associated with a wide variety of psychiatric\r\nand medical conditions.1 Its diagnosis can be challenging,\r\nand it is often underdiagnosed. This problem may be exacerbated\r\nin case of COVID-19, as many of the features and complications\r\nof the disease are still unknown. As the medical community understands\r\nmore about COVID-19, the presence of neuropsychiatric\r\nsequelae is becoming evident.\r\nIn each of the cases presented, the patient had a psychiatric\r\nhistory but no history of psychiatric hospitalization or catatonia,\r\nsuggesting a deviation from their typical psychiatric presentation\r\npotentially attributable to COVID-19. However, these cases presented\r\nwith varying degrees of respiratory symptoms, ranging\r\nfrom no symptoms to hospitalization. Prior studies have reported\r\nprimarily on neuropsychiatric illness in those patients with\r\nCOVID-19 respiratory symptoms requiring hospitalization.2 However,\r\nCOVID-19 is also associated with many mild and asymptomatic\r\ninfections. These cases present the possibility that neuropsychiatric\r\nmanifestations of COVID-19 may manifest independent of the\r\nseverity of respiratory illness or the possibility of coincidental infection\r\nwith the virus.\r\nCertain treatments for COVID-19 may also complicate neuropsychiatric\r\npresentations. For example, dexamethasone treatment\r\nmay be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse effects. In this\r\nseries, one patient did not receive dexamethasone at all, and the\r\nother two had neuropsychiatric symptoms that lasted well beyond\r\nthe administration of dexamethasone. As such, it is unlikely that\r\nthese cases can be explained by steroid induction alone.\r\nThe overlapping features of catatonia and delirium may play\r\na role in the limited recognition of catatonia in medically ill patients.\r\nDelirium is often considered when a medically ill patient\r\npresents with a waxing-and-waning mental status. However, catatonia\r\nmay have a similar presentation in regard to mental status. It\r\nmay be comorbid or distinct from delirium and cannot be distinguishedwithout\r\na thorough assessment and workup.An important\r\ndistinction, however, is that lorazepam and ECT are highly effective\r\nin the treatment of catatonia. Underdiagnoses may result in\r\nprolonged illness for individuals with a highly treatable disorder.\r\nWhile the available cases emphasize the importance of considering\r\ncatatonia in the setting of COVID-19, the data are insufficient\r\nto drawany conclusions about the frequency of catatonia in\r\npatients with COVID-19, or whether COVID-19 is a specific risk\r\nfactor for catatonia. Given the large number of patients suffering\r\nfrom COVID-19 and its severity, one possibility is that COVID-19\r\ncan trigger catatonia as a nonspecific stressor in patients who\r\nare otherwise susceptible to develop catatonia. However, potential\r\nmechanisms have been proposed connecting coronavirus\r\nand neuropsychiatric symptoms. This virus may have direct\r\nneurotoxic effects as glial cells and neurons express angiotensinconverting\r\nenzyme 2 receptors providing a way for the virus to\r\nspread.3 There is also a significant inflammatory response to the\r\nCOVID-19 virus, which may precipitate neuroinflammatory processes\r\nand/or compromise the blood-brain barrier leading to central\r\nnervous system dysfunction.4 Additional theories have also\r\nbeen proposed including postinfectious autoimmunity, immune\r\ncell transmigration, and hypoxic brain injury. There are also numerous\r\nreports of cross-reacting antibodies against host antigens,\r\nparticularly the development of anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor\r\nencephalitis both with and without respiratory involvement,\r\nmaking it imperative that autoimmune and paraneoplastic panels\r\nare performed.5 Further studies are needed to provide complete information\r\nregarding prevalence, risk factors, and mechanisms for\r\nthe relationship between COVID-19 and catatonia. However, the\r\ncurrent data demonstrate that it is imperative that catatonia be a\r\npart of the differential diagnosis for patients with COVID-19\r\nand altered mental status to ensure that a highly treatable condition\r\ndoes not go unrecognized.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

Catatonia After COVID-19: A Case Series. Journal of ECT. 2022;38(3):E43-4 on 20 Sep 2022. This spontaneous case was reported in the medical literature by a physician from the United States of America and concerns a 69-year-old female patient who experienced serious adverse reactions of paranoid, auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, catatonia, hypersexuality, poor judgment associated with dexamethasone. The patient with a history of bipolar II disorder was hospitalized for 10 days due to COVID-19 pneumonia, treated with remdesivir and dexamethasone and discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Patient then developed an altered mental status, became nonverbal and incontinent, and was transferred to the facility for further workup. Patient underwent an extensive workup, including cerebrospinal fluid with autoimmune and paraneoplastic panels. No pathological findings were detected. During hospitalization, patient had waxing and waning of mental status and manifested paranoid thought content and auditory and visual hallucinations. COVID encephalitis and seronegative autoimmune encephalitis were both considered, and patient was treated with a course of IV immunoglobulin without any notable improvement. Upon initial psychiatric evaluation, patient was thought to have delirium but subsequently showed signs of catatonia including echolalia, staring, posturing, stereotypy, mannerisms, and negativism. A lorazepam challenge was done, which produced improvements in the posturing and stereotypy, and IV lorazepam treatment was continued. Despite some improvement in catatonic symptoms, her executive function remained poor, and she additionally manifested a labile affect, pressured speech, hypersexuality, and poor judgment. Bitemporal ECTusing aMECTA 5000Q device (MECTA Corporation, Tualatin, OR) with a pulse width of 0.5 millisecond was added with rapid and significant improvement in executive function and mood symptoms for a total of 6 treatments. She was discharged on day 45 having returned to her baseline. Certain treatments for COVID-19 may also complicate neuropsychiatric presentations. For example, dexamethasone treatment may be associated with neuropsychiatric adverse effects. The neuropsychiatric symptoms lasted well beyond the administration of dexamethasone. As such, it is unlikely that this case can be explained by steroid induction alone.
