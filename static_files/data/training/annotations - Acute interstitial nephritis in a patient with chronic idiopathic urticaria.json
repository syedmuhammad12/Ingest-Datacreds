It usually affects females with a prevalence\r\nof 1% and mostly begins at the age of 30–50 years.2 Diagno\u0002sis mostly depend on chronic recurrent itching persisting at\r\nleast six weeks with exclusion of diseases like infections,\r\nmalignities, auto-immune and auto-inflammatory diseases.2,3\r\nTreatmentis needed for cumbersome symptom of pruritis and\r\nlife-threatening medical emergency of angioedema. Omalizu\u0002mab, which is recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody\r\nfor immunoglobulin (Ig) E is advised for treatment of CIU as the\r\nthird or fourth line of therapy after histamine receptor type 1\r\n(H1) antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists are\r\nunsuccessful.3,4\r\nA 53-year-old female patient with diabetes mellitus, hys\u0002terectomy and CIU had symptoms of nausea and fatigue.

Laboratory evaluation revealed increased serum creati\u0002nine level (1.64mg/dL) with respect to basal levels (0.65mg/dL)\r\nof 6 months earlier, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\r\n(estimated GFR using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology\r\nCollaboration, CKD-EPI equation was 34mL/min/1.73m2\r\n, crea\u0002tinine clearance using 24-h urine collection was 37.4mL/min),\r\nmicroalbuminuria (98mg/d), increased proteinuria (1.3 g/d),\r\nand increased beta-2 microglobulinuria (21,300\u0003g/L, normal\r\nvalue <300\u0003g/L5\r\n). Her urinary beta-2 microglobulin: creati\u0002nine ratio was 76071 (\u0003g/g) (normal < 300\u0003g/g6\r\n). Biochemically\r\nher serum creatinine level was increased to 2.21mg/dL within\r\n8 days (Table 1). Presence of high amount of low molecular\r\nweight proteins (beta-2 microglobulin) in her urine analy\u0002sis indicated tubular type consisting majority of proteinuria.\r\nKidney biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis accompa\u0002nied with chronic interstitial injury related findings without\r\nimmune deposition (Fig. 1). In addition, early stage of diabe\u0002tic nephropathy was observed due to diffuse basal membrane\r\nthickening. Oral methylprednisolone was given to the patient\r\natthe dose of 1mg/kg/d for treatment of AIN.7 Dose was slowly\r\ntapered to 5 mg/day after a month and prescribed for anot\u0002her 3 months. Her serum creatinine level was decreased from\r\n2.24mg/dL to 1.58mg/dL in 10 days of treatment, and after 4\r\nmonths her serum creatinine level was 0.82mg/dL.\r\nThe cause of AIN in majority of the patients was known\r\nas hypersensitivity towards drugs (75% of the cases).8 Prac\u0002tically, every drug may have a potential for causing AIN, yet\r\nmostly reported drugs are antibiotics, NSAID, proton pump\r\ninhibitors and allupurinol.9 The time interval between drug\r\nintake and onset of AIN can vary from 1 week to 9 months\r\n(10–11 weeks being the commonest) among the patients.9\r\nFig. 1 – Severe interstitial lymphocytic (including\r\neosinophylic lymphocytes, plasma cells and mostly\r\nmononuclear leukocytes) infiltration affected 60% of cortical\r\narea, and interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy involved\r\n30% of the tissue, H.E. 100×.\r\nThe most possible offending agent for AIN of the patient was\r\nthought as diclofenac since absence of any report regarding\r\nthe other medications that our patient had taken (methyl\u0002prednisolone, dexketoprofen, gliclazide, metformin, bilastine,\r\nand omalizumab). It is known that NSAID induced AIN does\r\nnot generally response to glucocorticoid therapy.7 Conflicting\r\nwith this information, our patient responded well to corti\u0002costeroid treatment which made us suspect some other drug\r\nshe used might have led to AIN other than NSAID. The asso\u0002ciation of CIU with AIN has not been reported yet. It might\r\nbe possible but needs to be clarified that AIN of our patient\r\nmay result from one of the hypersensitivity reaction and\r\nmanifestation of CIU. However, her itching symptoms comple\u0002tely abolished by omalizumab and this AIN developed during\r\nomalizumab treatment of 5 months duration. Omalizumab\r\nhas been shown to decrease serum eosinophil levels and\r\neffective in treatment of CIU through its functions against\r\nne f rologia 2 0 2 2;42(1):99–109 107\r\neosinophils.10 In theory, omalizumab might have been pro\u0002tective for development of AIN via these eosinophil depleting\r\neffects. However, even though 5 months of omalizumab treat\u0002ment, our patient had AIN which was treated successfully with\r\nmethylprednisolone.\r\nIn conclusion, AIN of our case most probably was secondary\r\nto diclofenac intake 5 months earlier even though presence of\r\nresponse to glucocorticoids. Whether presence of CIU increase\r\nthe tendency of patients to development of AIN secondary to\r\noffending drugs has not been known yet. Renalfunctions espe\u0002cially tubular proteinuria should be evaluated and searched\r\nthoroughly in order to diagnose early and treat appropria\u0002tely for AIN among individuals with CIU before and during\r\nprescription of any drug.\r\nAuthors’ contributions\r\nKubra Kaynar: Conception, design, drafting the article.\r\nNejla Küc¸ük: Drafting the article.\r\nSevdegül Mungan: Drafting the pathological data of the case.\r\nBeyhan Güvercin: Drafting the article.\r\nS¸ ükrü Ulusoy: Drafting the article.\r\nConflicts of interest\r\n\r\nKubra Kaynar a,∗\r\n, Nejla Küc¸ükb\r\n, Sevdegül Munganc\r\n,\r\nBeyhan Güvercina\r\n, S¸ükrü Ulusoya\r\na Department of Nephrology, Karadeniz Technical University,\r\nFaculty of Medicine, Trabzon, Turkey\r\nb Department of Internal Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University,\r\nFaculty of Medicine, Trabzon, Turkey\r\nc Department of Pathology, Karadeniz Technical University, Faculty\r\nof Medicine, Trabzon, Turkey\r\n∗ Corresponding author.\r\nE-mail address: kkaynar@yahoo.com (K.
