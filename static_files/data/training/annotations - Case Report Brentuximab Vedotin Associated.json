Thanks to\nadvances in its treatment, a 5-year event-free survival rate exceeds 90% [2]. Adverse outcomes in the\nremaining 10% of patients are related to various factors, including advanced stage of disease, bulky\ndisease, pleural and cardiac effusion [3–6]. In addition, male sex and initially slow response to\ncommencing cycles of chemotherapy are adverse prognostic factors [3, 7]. Global results of HL\ntreatment are excellent, yet refractory HL remains a therapeutic challenge. Due to the small\npercentage of complex cases, a limited number of clinical trials focus on refractory Hodgkin\ndisease [2]. Moreover, another aspect that should be considered is the questionable ethics of clinical\ntrials conducted among pediatric patients. Some of the agents may have different pharmacokinetics\nand side effects that may even affect a child’s development, hence reluctance to conduct such\ntrials [8].\nIn the pediatric population, the leading protocol used for the ﬁrst-line treatment of Hodgkin\nlymphoma was established by the European Network-Paediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group\n(EuroNet-PHL) [2]. This trial’s strategy focuses on the restriction of radiation therapy by including\npatients with Deauville scores 4 and 5 only and augmentation of chemotherapy intensity in\nintermediate and advanced HL [2]. Second-line and further lines of treatment comprise various\n\n1\n\nAugust 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610445\n\n\fTruszkowska et al.\n\nBrentuximab Vedotin Associated Acute Pancreatitis\n\nand there was one infusion of 162 mg (1.8 mg/kg)\nbrentuximab vedotin.\nAfter 2 weeks from the ﬁrst brentuximab vedotin\nadministration, the patient presented to the emergency\ndepartment with abdominal and back pain and vomiting.\nPhysical examination revealed tachycardia, abdominal\nbloatedness, and disseminated pain in palpation of the whole\nabdomen. In laboratory tests inﬂammatory reaction was observed\n(CRP 5.32 mg%, leucocytes 17 990/mm3, neutrophils 15 870/\nmm3) and levels of pancreatic enzymes were increased (amylase\n1665 U/L, lipase 3853 U/L). Triglycerides levels were within\nreference values—118 mg/dl and rose up to maximum of\n170 mg/dl on the 10th day of hospitalization. Ultrasound\ninvestigations revealed a slightly enlarged pancreas as\ncompared to age (head 1.9 cm, body 2.6 cm, tail 2.4 cm),\nperipancreatic adipose tissue of increased echogenicity and\nsign of free ﬂuid in the peritoneal cavity. CT scan conﬁrmed\nthe inﬂammatory reaction of tissues surrounding the pancreas.\nThe patient was administered pain medications - metamizole and\ntramadol, ﬂuid therapy, meropenem, ondansetron and\nomeprazole. A gastric tube was also used. Due to the\nincreasing severity of pain, its treatment was changed to\nmorphine and nalbuphine. Parenteral feeding was introduced.\nDuring the following days, there was a signiﬁcant increase in\ninﬂammatory parameters (maximum C-reactive protein 42 mg\n%), and therefore, the antibiotic therapy was intensiﬁed. Gradual\nclinical improvement of the patient and normalization of\npancreatic enzymes was observed. However, the patient\ncomplained of strengthening symptoms resulting from the\nunderlying Hodgkin lymphoma. The increase of inﬂammatory\nmarkers was also observed. Chest CT conﬁrmed the progression\nof the disease and the rise in tumors’ inﬁltration. Oral steroid\ntherapy was introduced and DHAP (cytarabine 2000 mg/m2,\ncisplatin 100 mg/m2, dexamethasone 40 mg/m2) chemotherapy\nregimen was planned. It was followed without any severe sideeffects, except transient increase of transaminase level. The\npatient is still being treated with a DHAP regimen with a\nnon-satisfactory result. It is planned he will be given\nnivolumab as the last-chance treatment and followed by\nautologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Illustration\nof chemotherapy sequence is shown in Figure 1.\n\nschemes of chemotherapy, which may be combined with\nbrentuximab vedotin (BV), nivolumab, or followed by\nautologous hematopoietic cell transplantation [2].\nBrentuximab vedotin is an anti-CD30 directed antibodydrug conjugate to auristatin, initially used in adult patients with\nHL and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, refractory and relapsed\n[9, 10]. Now, its use is investigated among the pediatric\npopulation in several clinical trials [11, 12]. The pivotal\nstudy conducted by Locatelli et al. showed BV is an agent\nable to reduce late toxicity and adverse events among pediatric\npatients that stems from the administration of traditional\nchemotherapy [12]. In addition, it proved to help lead to\nautologous stem cell transplantation in these patients. The\nmost common adverse reactions include peripheral\nneuropathy and neutropenia [11, 12]. While acute\npancreatitis has been described in a few case series and case\nreports, all previously described patients were adults [13–15].\nBrentuximab vedotin is the ﬁrst agent that should be\nconsidered while planning the treatment of R/R HL with any\nnovel agents [12]. The combination of brentuximab vedotin\nand bendamustine was introduced after studies conducted by\nVinti et al. and McMillan et al. showed promising data for\npediatric patients with little data on severe toxicity [16, 17].\nIn this case report, we describe a 17-year-old male patient with\nrefractory Hodgkin lymphoma that was administered\nbrentuximab vedotin and bendamustine (B) in his 4th cycle of\ntreatment. He developed acute pancreatitis 2 weeks after the ﬁrst\ninfusion of BV. We also review other BV-associated pancreatitis\ncase reports described in the literature, elucidate the possible\nmechanism of this adverse event and present the consensus on\nthe treatment of AP in pediatric oncological patients.\n\nCASE REPORT\nA currently 17-year-old overweight male patient (1.79 m, 90 kg,\nBMI 28.09) with a bulky (>200 ml) mediastinal tumor was\ndiagnosed with nodular sclerosis classical HL, IIIAE grade,\nintermediate therapeutic group (TL-2) at the age of 16. Due to\nlife-threatening pressure of the mass and superior vena cava\nsyndrome, as well as venous thrombosis, the debulking operation\nwas performed. At ﬁrst, steroid treatment was implemented.\nLater, the patient was enrolled in the EuroNET-PHLC2 clinical trial [18]. The patient was administered OEPA\n(vincristine sulfate 1.5 mg/m2, etoposide phosphate 125 mg/m2,\ndoxorubicin hydrochloride 40 mg/m2, prednisone 60 mg/m2)\nchemotherapy. After two cycles, his group was changed to\nadvanced (TL-3) due to mass penetration into the spinal canal\nin the thoracic Th2/Th3 segment, and he was qualiﬁed to\nCOPDAC (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, vincristine sulfate\n1.4 mg/m2, dacarbazine 250 mg/m2, prednisone 40 mg/m2).\nDespite intensiﬁed chemotherapy regimen, an interim PET-CT\nscan showed progression (Deauville 5). Therefore, treatment was\nchanged to IGEV (ifosfamide 2000 mg/m2, gemcitabine 800 mg/\nm2, vinorelbine 20 mg/m2, prednisolone 100 mg/m2). Later,\nbrentuximab vedotin and bendamustine were introduced:\n188.1 mg (90 mg/m2) bendamustine was administered twice\n\nPathology & Oncology Research\n\nDISCUSSION\nDespite an excellent overall prognosis, refractory HL still poses a\ntherapeutic challenge. The optimal therapy in R/R Hodgkin\ndisease in pediatric patients has not been established due to\nthe scarcity of data and lack of randomized trials that could\ncompare possible approaches and their effectiveness. It is\nunknown whether standard-dose chemotherapy is better than\nhigh dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell\ntransplant; only small cohort national trials show that high\ndose chemotherapy is usually not needed [2]. EuroNet\nPediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma group has thus issued\nguidelines on approaching refractory HL considering new\npossible therapies that include brentuximab vedotin. The panel\n\n2\n\nAugust 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610445\n\n\fTruszkowska et al.\n\nBrentuximab Vedotin Associated Acute Pancreatitis\n\nFIGURE 1 | The sequence and number of chemotherapy regimens administered.\n\nalso considers the stratiﬁcation of patients into three subgroups\ndepending on the time of relapse and previous treatment. The\ndescribed patient qualiﬁes to the high-risk group that includes\npatients that failed to achieve remission in PET-CT after two lines\nof salvage standard-dose therapy. Such patients are candidates for\ntreatment with conventional high dose chemotherapy,\nautologous stem cell transplantation and additional therapies,\ni.e., biological drugs or experimental strategies.\nThe use of BV-B (brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine)\nhas proved to have a non-dangerous safety proﬁle. The use of\nthese agents provokes a long-lasting response to the treatment\nand is a bridge to autologous stem cell transplantation in the\nfuture, providing the possibility of stem cell mobilization [2].\nIt is worth mentioning that the patient is overweight (BMI\n28.09) and the dose of brentuximab vedotin is weight-dependent.\nThe required dosage of BV for patients from 12 years old\nweighing between 50 and 100 kg is 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks or\n1.2 mg/kg every 2 weeks. However, in younger children [19],\ntreatment results were worse using these doses. Suri et al.\nelucidated in their pharmacokinetics analysis that the\nrecommended dose suitable for all the patients (up to 100 kg)\nis 71.5 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and 47.7 mg/m2 every 2 weeks and it\nprovides the same concentrations of the drug (AUC, area under\ncurve). In the case of our patient, the calculated dose would\ntherefore be 148.7 mg, which is a slightly smaller dose than the\none calculated based on the patient’s weight. Nevertheless,\nstatistical correlation between the dose of BV and acute\npancreatitis or different adverse events has not been proven in\nliterature yet. In the case of our patient, it is essential to keep in\nmind that high body mass index and adiposity increase the risk of\nAP and being overweight is a negative prognostic factor of AP\nseverity [20–23].\n\n(NCT01476410) [24], which led to the exclusion of patients with\na history of AP. Then one patient without such history developed\nthis toxicity. Urru et al. reported the ﬁrst known case of BVinduced pancreatitis in a Hodgkin lymphoma patient [14]. Even\nthough the patient developed symptoms of acute pancreatitis a\nfew days after the second infusion of the drug, which differs,\nsymptoms and clinical outcome were similar to our case and\nfollowing case reports. Gandhi et al. describe a case series of\n8 patients with acute pancreatitis that emerged in a median time\nof 26 days after the ﬁrst exposure to brentuximab vedotin and\n12 days after its recent administration [15]. Maradana et al.\nreported severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis\n2 weeks after the ﬁrst brentuximab treatment in a patient with\nT-cell skin lymphoma [13]. As mentioned earlier, BV is also\nuseful in the treatment of CD30+ ALCL [12]. Chen et al. describe\nthe ﬁrst case of fatal pancreatitis on the 13th day in a patient\nsuffering from ALCL [25]. All the reported cases of BV-induced\npancreatitis are listed in Table 1. Interestingly, there is a case of\npolatuzumab-vedotin-piiq-induced pancreatitis reported in\nliterature. No previous pancreas-related adverse events were\nreported during clinical trials with this agent [26].\nThe vast majority of BV-induced AP cases are revealed after\nthe ﬁrst and second administration of the agent. In our case, the\npatient developed acute pancreatitis after 2 weeks from ﬁrst and\nonly brentuximab vedotin intake, which is consistent with\nprevious reports. Three patients continued BV intake, 2 of\nwhich did without any adverse events and one of the patients\ndeveloped pancreatitis again after three other infusions. This data\nis too scarce to say whether the administration of BV should be\ndiscontinued in all the cases or can be resumed with a beneﬁt for\nthe patient. For now, its readministration should be discouraged.\nOur patient had no chance to proﬁt from this treatment as one\ncycle of BV proves too little to objectively assess its impact.\n\nLITERATURE REVIEW\n\nPatomechanism of BV-Induced Pancreatitis\nThe cause of BV-induced pancreatitis is still uncertain.\nNevertheless, another case report suggests targeting variable\nlow-level CD30 in the pancreas due to higher expression of in\npatients than in mouse immunoglobulin controls [15]. Also,\nother considered mechanisms of this adverse effect are\ncirculating unconjugated monomethylauristatin E or the\noccurrence of isolated CD30-positive malignant cells in the\npancreas [15]. Host-dependent reasons are also considered,\nsuch as predisposing genetic variants, which the best described\nare PRSS1, CTRC, SPINK1, CFTR [27].\n\nOther BV-Induced Pancreatitis Cases\nDescribed in the Literature\nAlmost one-ﬁfth of the BV patients present abdominal pain,\nwhich raises the question of whether BV-induced pancreatitis is\nunderdiagnosed or truly rare. So far, only a few cases of\nbrentuximab vedotin induced pancreatitis in patients with HL\nhave been reported in the literature, of which two were fatal, but\nnone of them occurred in the pediatric population. One fatal\npancreatitis was reported at the beginning of the clinical trial\n\nPathology & Oncology Research\n\n3\n\nAugust 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610445\n\n\fTruszkowska et al.\n\nBrentuximab Vedotin Associated Acute Pancreatitis\n\nTABLE 1 | The summary of all reported cases of pancreatitis associated with brentuximab vedotin treatment.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nSex of the\npatient\n\nAge\n\nDisease\n\nCycle\n\nOutcome\n\nReferences\n\nF\nF\nM\nM\nF\nF\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\n\n65\n34\n23\n52\n25\n63\n51\n38\n32\n38\n65\n17\n\nHL\nHL\nHL\nHL\nHL\nALCL\nHL\nHL\nALCL\ncutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma\nHL\nHL\n\n2\n1\n2, 5\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\nGrade 5, death\n5\n4\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nGrade 5, death\nGood; continuation of BV treatment\nGrade 3, continuation of BV treatment\nGood outcome, change of regimen\n\n[24]\n[15]\n\nAcute Pancreatitis as a Side Effect of Drugs\nUsed in Pediatric Oncology\n\ninhibiting its chymotrypsin activity. However, this side effect is\nrare, occurring in 0,1–2% of cases [35]. The mechanism of\ninﬂammation is still unknown, but direct drug toxicity or\nallergic and immunological causes are considered [35].\nElevation of pancreatic enzymes is observed chieﬂy a few days\nafter drug administration. It is possible to continue bortezomib\ntherapy [35].\nAP should also be considered an adverse effect of\nmercaptopurine; however, its frequency depends on the treated\ndisease. For example, in inﬂammatory bowel disease patients,\nmercaptopurine-associated AP is a well-described complication\nof treatment, occurring in 2–6% of cases [36]. When it comes to\nhematological diseases, fewer reports can be found. Nevertheless,\nthere are described cases in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [37].\nAlso, cytarabine may induce AP. Very few papers report that\nside effect in acute myeloblastic leukemia [38]. Therefore, the\nmechanism is not found, but previous exposure to asparaginase is\nconsidered.\nAP may also be concerning in the stem cell transplantation\nscenario as it may be caused by tacrolimus or cyclosporine [39].\nVery few case reports can be found with tacrolimus-associated\nAP, most of them after solid organ transplantation [40]. The\nmajority of them reported high or very high concentrations of\ntacrolimus and cyclosporine was implemented instead [40].\n\nAcute pancreatitis may be caused by various drugs, also those\nused in pediatric oncology. However, diagnosis of drug-induced\nAP is often unclear and based only on clinical suspicion rather\nthan evidence. In addition, many case reports do not exclude\nmore common reasons for AP, such as gallstones, alcohol,\nhypertriglyceridemia, which makes it a real challenge to ﬁnd\nthe actual frequency of drug-associated pancreatitis [28].\nIn pediatric oncology, steroids, antibiotics such as tetracyclines\nand\ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,\nasparaginase\nand\nmercaptopurine are associated with drug-induced AP [29].\nThe most widely known drug to cause AP is asparaginase,\nwith the ﬁrst case reported in the 1970s and one of the most\nimportant reasons to stop this drug [29, 30]. The evolution of\nasparaginase treatment and its new generations was crucial in\nimproving the treatment results [31]. Approximately 2–18% of\npatients administered with asparaginase are affected by that side\nreaction [31]. Pathophysiology is yet unknown but is probably\nrelated to the mechanism of action of this drug. Asparaginase\ndepletes external sources of asparagine, which is detrimental for\nlymphoblasts and affects organs with high protein expenditure\nlike the pancreas [30]. The risk of AP is independent from dose or\nroute of administration [30]. Another critical factor is the\nconcomitant use of steroids, especially dexamethasone [32].\nPossibly important risk factors are age, concurrent therapy\nwith other anticancer drugs, some genetic variants and\nhypertriglyceridemia [30]. Asparaginase therapy may be\nreintroduced only when amylase or lipase is mildly elevated\nand the patient presents no clinical symptoms [30].\nNevertheless, more than 60% of re-exposed patients may have\na relapse [33]. Compared to brentuximab vedotin, clinical\nsymptoms, diagnostics methods and general outcomes are\nsimilar to those in generally healthy children [29]. However,\nimmunodeﬁciency should be kept in mind and the adverse effects\nof other oncological drugs.\nBortezomib is another drug used in reinduction therapy of\nALL in children that have been described to provoke acute\npancreatitis [34]. Its mechanism of action is based on a\nreversible inhibition of proteasome subunit 26s, thereby\n\nPathology & Oncology Research\n\n[25]\n[13]\n[14]\nThis case report\n\nTreatment of Pancreatitis in Pediatric\nOncological Patients\nManagement of AP in leukemia/lymphoma patients should be\nmore intensive than in less complicated cases. Due to the poorer\noncological outcome after canceling the drug, it is imperative to\nassure whether there is pancreatitis, its severity and therefore a\nneed to stop the treatment. In an asymptomatic course, when\nonly enzymes are elevated (chemical pancreatitis), it is possible to\ncontinue drug administration [41].\nPharmacotherapy of AP remains a controversial topic and the\nuse of antibiotics, protease inhibitors and octreotide are widely\ndiscussed. Prophylactic use of antibiotics is generally discouraged\nuntil infected necrosis is proved [42]. However, even in the case of\nacute necrotizing pancreatitis, the data is inconsistent. Two\ncontrolled, double-blind studies and one meta-analysis show\n\n4\n\nAugust 2022 | Volume 28 | Article 1610445\n\n\fTruszkowska et al.\n\nBrentuximab Vedotin Associated Acute Pancreatitis\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nno beneﬁt of antibiotics therapy, while two separate metaanalyses concluded that the patients with proven pancreatic\nnecrosis should receive either imipenem or meropenem\nprophylaxis [29, 43, 44, 45].\nOn the other hand, when l-asparaginase induced AP is\nconcerned, authors suggest using broad-spectrum antibiotics,\nespecially imipenem or meropenem [46]. This approach is\nseen in adult ALL patients as well, with recognition of no\nclear evidence that antibiotics prevent the development of\nsepsis or other complications [47].\nAll authors agree that supportive care is crucial [29]. Fluid\ntherapy, proper nutrition and pain management are\nundoubtedly critical. Patient monitoring (cardiovascular,\npulmonary and renal parameters) is essential to determine\nAP complications quickly.\n\nIt should be kept in mind that any epigastric pain in a patient that\nintakes brentuximab vedotin should be closely diagnosed as it may\nbe a symptom of acute pancreatitis. While this drug is characterized\nby an overall safe proﬁle and proves to be very efﬁcient in treating\nrefractory Hodgkin disease, acute pancreatitis is a severe adverse\nreaction, which requires immediate, adequate treatment and may\nlead to further complications. The direct link between BV and\nacute pancreatitis cannot be proved. Nonetheless, based on\nprevious case reports, we wish to highlight such possibility and\nreport such association in the pediatric patient.\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in\nthe article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be\ndirected to the corresponding author.\n\nOther Rare Complications and Toxicities\nAssociated With Brentuximab Vedotin\nBV may cause many more or less serious side effects, apart from\nAP, such as peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, neutropenia,\ndiarrhea, pyrexia, vomiting, arthralgia, pruritus, myalgia [48].\nThe most fatal and rare toxicity is progressive multifocal\nleukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by JC infection [49]. To\nthe best of our knowledge, nine cases have been reported so far\nand at least six of them are lethal [49]. PML is often a fatal\ndisease caused by the reactivation of JCV. Currently, it is\nassociated with HIV infection, yet less known is the fact\nthat before the spread of HIV, patients with\nlymphoproliferative disorders were ones who mostly\nsuffered from PML [49]. The disease is associated with\nchemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications as well as\nmonoclonal antibodies, including natalizumab, rituximab\nand brentuximab vedotin [49]. The most common\nsymptoms of PML are motor weakness, gait abnormality,\nsensory loss, speech disorders and visual abnormalities [50].\nProduct monograph of brentuximab vedotin accentuates the\nimportance of symptom monitoring and proper diagnostics as\nsoon as they emerge [51]. Drugs should be stopped in PML\npatients and are contraindicated for patients who have had\nPML [51].\n\nETHICS STATEMENT\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the minor(s)’ legal\nguardian/next of kin for the publication of any potentially\nidentiﬁable images or data included in this article.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nAW and KD, conceptualization; ET, MA, and CS, manuscript\nwriting; ET, MA, CS, AW, and KD, ﬁnal manuscript editing and\nreview.
