On hospital day 2 the patient’s headache, diffuse body\r\npain, spasticity, paresthesias improved. The patient was discharged\r\non hospital day 4 with baseline neurologic exam and\r\nnear resolution of symptoms.\r\nDiscussion: Our patient developed encephalopathy like other\r\ntoxic IT overdoses. There is limited published experience with IT\r\nAmBd overdose and patients can experience significant toxicity\r\nwith routine therapeutic administration. Due to the lack of published\r\nexperience this overdose was treated as a potentially lifethreatening\r\nexposure. Ommaya reservoir CSF exchange was initially\r\nattempted to limit further drug exposure. AmBd is highly\r\nlipophilic, which may have limited the effectiveness of CSF\r\nexchange relative to better established indications such as IT\r\ndoxorubicin or methotrexate overdoses, which both have low lipophilicity.\r\nIt is possible that a majority of AmBd had already peripherally\r\ndistributed after 8 h and thus CSF exchange was not\r\nrepeated. The patient was also administered parental corticosteroids\r\nto treat inflammation. It is unclear if the CSF exchange\r\nand/or corticosteroids limited toxicity or hastened recovery; it is\r\npossible that we simply observed the natural course of toxicity.\r\nConclusions: Intrathecal amphotericin B deoxycholate overdoses\r\nremains a rare and scantly reported toxicity. Toxic encephalopathy\r\nmay result after overdose. Until further research is performed\r\nit is reasonable to pursue CSF exchange to limit drug\r\nabsorption and to administer parenteral corticosteroids.\r\nKEYWORDS Intrathecal; amphotericin; encephalopathy\r\ngwink3@gmail.com\r\n290. National estimates of\r\nantidepressant-related poison center\r\ncalls\r\nSaumitra Rege, Will Goodrich and Christopher\r\nHolstege\r\nUniversity of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA\r\nBackground: Approximately 92,000 persons in the US died from\r\ndrug-involved overdose in 2020. Estimated rates of depressive\r\nand anxiety symptoms among adults have increased in recent\r\nyears. According to a recent study, more than 20 million antidepressants\r\nwere prescribed between October and December 2020.\r\nThe objective of our study was to evaluate the trends in antidepressant-\r\nrelated calls to the US poison centers (PCs).\r\nMethods: The National Poison Data System (NPDS) was queried\r\nfor all closed, human exposures to antidepressants from January\r\n01, 2015 through December 31, 2021 using the American\r\nAssociation of Poison Control Center (AAPCC) generic code identifiers.\r\nWe identified and descriptively assessed the relevant\r\ndemographic and clinical characteristics. Reports from acute care\r\nhospitals and hospital based EDs (ACHs) were evaluated as a\r\nsubset. Trends in antidepressant frequencies and rates (per\r\n100,000 human exposures) were analyzed using Poisson regression\r\nmethods. Percent changes from the first year of the study\r\n(2014) were reported with the corresponding 95% confidence\r\nintervals (95% CI).\r\nResults: During the study period, there were 836,045 toxic exposures\r\nto antidepressants that were reported to the PCs. The frequency\r\nof exposures increased by 20.3% (95% CI: 16.1%, 23.9%;\r\np<0.001), and the rate of exposures decreased by 22.3% (95%\r\nCI: 17.8%, 25.9%; p<0.001). Of the total antidepressant calls, the\r\nproportion of calls from ACHs decreased from 38.3% to 34.8%,\r\nwhile the percentage of calls from the general public increased.\r\nMultiple substance exposures accounted for 52.4% of the overall\r\nantidepressant calls and 56% of calls from ACHs. Approximately\r\n18% of the patients with reported antidepressant exposures\r\nwere admitted to a critical care unit (CCU), with 17% of patients\r\nadmitted to a psychiatric facility. Residence was the most common\r\nsite of exposure (93.8%), and 67% of these cases were\r\nenroute to the hospital via EMS when the PC was notified. Cases\r\nwere predominantly female (65.3%), with the most common age\r\ngroup being 20–29 years (14.9%). The proportion of such cases\r\n(28.7–34.1%) increased during the study period. Suspected suicides\r\n(57.2%) were the most common reason for exposure, with\r\nthe proportions of suspected suicides being higher in cases\r\nreported by ACH (12.1% vs 14.9%). During the study period, the\r\nproportion of reported antidepressant exposures due to therapeutic\r\nerrors increased (18.5–22.3%), while suspected suicides\r\ndecreased (58.6–54.2%). Major effects were seen in 8.2% cases\r\nand case fatality rate was 0.3%, with 169 fatalities reported for\r\nsingle substance antidepressant exposures. The most frequently\r\nco-occurring substances associated with the cases were alcohol\r\n(12%) and marijuana (9.7%). Tachycardia (42.8%) and agitation\r\n(35.5%) were commonly observed clinical effects.\r\nConclusions: Our study results demonstrate a significant increase\r\nin the reports of antidepressant exposures made to the PCs.\r\nExposures in young age groups were common and the most frequent\r\nreason for exposure were suspected suicides. Continued\r\nsurveillance and public health prevention efforts are key to track\r\nthe population effects of antidepressant exposures.\r\nKEYWORDS Antidepressant; National Poison Data System; overdose\r\nsvr5d@hscmail.mcc.virginia.edu\r\n291. Don’t let metformin toxicity fall\r\ninto the knowledge gap: a case series\r\nof patients with elevated osmolar gap\r\nin the setting of metformin toxicity\r\nCarin Malley, William Trautman, Alek Adkins,\r\nMatthew Scanlon, Anthony Pizon and Joseph Yanta\r\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\r\nBackground: Osmolar gap is a commonly employed screening\r\ntool for toxic alcohol ingestion largely due to the relative scarcity\r\nof gas chromatography needed to measure quantitative serum\r\nlevels of methanol and ethylene glycol. The positive and negative\r\npredictive values of serum osmol gap for toxic alcohols are\r\npoor, especially when a value of 10 mOsm/L is used as the upper\r\nlimit of normal. However, many non-toxicologists do not appreciate\r\nthe diagnostic limitations and broad differential that remains\r\nafter an elevated osmolar gap is identified. This can lead to mismanagement\r\nof patients. In this case series we present three\r\ncases with osmolar gap >30 mOsm/L in the setting of metformin\r\nassociated metabolic acidosis (MAMA) and in the absence of\r\ntoxic alcohol exposure.\r\nCase series: We present a series of three patients evaluated at a\r\ntertiary care center with MAMA and osmolar gaps >30 mOsm/L\r\nin the absence of toxic alcohol exposure. Diagnosis of MAMA\r\nwas made by board certified medical toxicologists based on presentation\r\nwith severe metabolic acidosis, lactate elevation, and\r\nmetformin exposure with factors that would decrease metformin\r\nelimination. In cases #1 and #3, diagnosis was confirmed with\r\nquantitative serum metformin levels of 38mcg/mL and 470mcg/\r\nmL, respectively. Metformin level was not available in case #2. All\r\nthree patients had a pH <6.9 and lactate >15mMol/L. In cases\r\n#1 and #2, the mechanism of metformin accumulation was continued\r\ntherapeutic metformin doses in the setting of severe\r\nacute kidney injury (AKI) with presenting creatinine of 11 and\r\n15.32mg/dL, respectively. In case #3, the patient presented soon\r\nafter an acute ingestion of 90gm of metformin and 60 tablets of\r\n142 ABSTRACT\r\nacetaminophen-diphenhydramine combination product. By the\r\ntime case #3 was transferred to the tertiary care center 3 h later,\r\nshe was anuric. Osmolar gap was calculated using the standard\r\nequation [(2\u0007Na)þ(BUN/2.8) þ glucose/18)]. Ethanol was negative\r\nin all three cases. Osmolar gap was calculated at 39.8, 46,\r\nand 34.8 mOsm/kg for patients #1, #2, and #3, respectively.\r\nMethanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol were ruled out\r\nby serum gas chromatography for patients #1 and #2 and by history\r\nand collateral information in patient #3. All three were\r\ntreated with continuous hemodialysis (HD) for 10.75 h, 13 h, and\r\n47.75 h respectively until serum lactate levels were <3mMol/L in\r\naccordance with EXTRIP guidelines.\r\nDiscussion: While previous literature has documented that a lactate\r\nelevation is associated with an elevated osmolar gap of\r\napproximately 10.3mmol/kg, there has only been one other\r\nreported case of elevated osmolar gap in the setting of MAMA.\r\nThat previous case documented an osmolar gap of 20 mOsm/kg.\r\nOur series is the first to document multiple confirmed cases of\r\nMAMA with a serum osmolar gap >30 mOsm/kg.\r\nConclusions: Patients with MAMA can develop an osmolar gap\r\nof >30 mOsm/kg. MAMA is a life threatening and treatable condition\r\nthat should be a part of the complete differential diagnosis\r\nof the critically ill patient with an elevated osmolar gap,\r\nprofound acidosis and elevated lactate.\r\nKEYWORDS Osmolar gap; metformin; metabolic acidosis\r\nmalleyck@upmc.edu\r\n292. Breaking the heart and breaking\r\nthe blood: a case series of cutaneoushemolytic\r\nloxoscelism with cardiac\r\ninvolvement\r\nRebecca Bruccoleria, Samuel Littlejohnb, Christopher\r\nHendersonb, Jeffrey Weinerb, Adam Skaffb and\r\nSaralyn Williamsb\r\naTennessee Poison Center, Nashville, TN, USA; bVanderbilt\r\nChildren’s Hospital, Nashville, TN, USA\r\nBackground: Brown recluse envenomations may range from\r\nlocalized necrotic skin lesions to systemic illness with serious\r\ncomplications including rapid hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and\r\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation. Myocarditis has rarely\r\nbeen reported.\r\nCase series: Case 1: 12 y/o girl presented to the ED with 2 days\r\nof fever, malaise, sore throat, and rash on the left arm after a\r\nstay at an outdoor summer camp where loxosceles reclusa are\r\nendemic. She was tachycardic and febrile, with a 1-cm black\r\nbulla on her proximal left arm with surrounding erythema to distal\r\narm. Her HCT was 41.1% and she was admitted for treatment\r\nof cellulitis and concern for sepsis or toxic shock syndrome. On\r\nhospital day (HD) 5, transthoracic echo (TTE) showed hyperdynamic\r\nwall motion. She was transferred to a referral hospital on\r\nHD 6 where she was afebrile but tachycardic and tachypneic.\r\nPhysical exam showed diffuse erythroderma and pustulosis with\r\na 2cm \u00073 cm black eschar at the site of the previously noted\r\nbulla. Her CRP was 149.4mg/L, ESR >145mm/h, Hct 13%, troponin-\r\nI 0.20 ng/mL (normal <0.03), BNP 856 pg/mL (normal <100),\r\nlactate 12mmol/L (normal 0.5–2.02 mmol/L). ECG showed sinus\r\ntachycardia. She was given 1 unit pRBCs and admitted for cutaneous-\r\nhemolytic loxoscelism. On HD 7, she developed respiratory\r\nfailure requiring intubation. Subsequent TTE showed mild-tomoderately\r\ndepressed LV function and mildly depressed RV function.\r\nTroponin peaked at 0.83 ng/mL. TTE 2 days later showed\r\nnormal wall motion. She was extubated after 5 days. She\r\nrequired a total of 7u pRBCs. She was discharged on HD 15 and\r\nfollowed in toxicology clinic. Her wound exhibited good healing\r\nuntil she was lost to follow-up \u00062 months after discharge. Case\r\n2: 15 y/o girl presented with a \u00062 cm \u00071.5 cm necrotic lesion to\r\nher right medial calf with surrounding induration and erythema.\r\nShe first noticed the lesion 5 days prior to admission and rash\r\non her arms the following day. Review of relevant systems was\r\notherwise negative. Exam revealed tachycardia, no conjunctival\r\npallor, the lesion noted above, and a blanching, macular rash to\r\narms, abdomen, and legs, suggestive of systemic loxoscelism.\r\nInitial HCT was 35% and CRP was 87.9 mg/L. She was admitted\r\nfor serial HCT and UA monitoring. Overnight between HD 1 and\r\n2, she developed vomiting, and the following morning, substernal\r\nchest pain with burning. Her ECG showed 0.5–1mm ST elevation\r\nin V4-V6 diagnosed as early repolarization. Her troponin was\r\n3.52 ng/mL which peaked at 3.83 ng/mL and normalized after 5\r\ndays. TTE was normal for age. Her HCT fell to 26 on HD 2 and to\r\n21 on HD 3, she received 2 units of pRBCs. Repeat HCT was 33\r\nand no further pRBCs required. She was discharged on HD 6 and\r\nfollowed in toxicology clinic. In outpatient cardiology clinic, there\r\nwas concern that patient had myocarditis, but she did not\r\nrequire follow up, given resolution of symptoms and normal\r\ntroponin. An ECG \u00062 months later was normal without ST\r\nelevation.\r\nDiscussion: There are rare reports of myocarditis associated with\r\nloxosceles envenomations. A murine model has demonstrated\r\nbinding and injury of the myocardium from Loxosceles intermedia\r\nvenom. Previous reports of rhabdomyolysis did not always\r\nexclude myocardial injury as the cause of the elevated creatine\r\nkinase.\r\nConclusions: These two cases demonstrate the possibility of\r\nmyocardial involvement with acute loxoscelism and illustrate the\r\nneed for vigilance in caring for these patients.\r\nKEYWORDS Brown recluse; myocarditis; hemolysis\r\nRebecca.e.Bruccoleri@vumc.org\r\n293.

Fab and F(ab’)2 antivenoms (AV),\r\nwith no Fc portion, lower protein content, and more efficient\r\npurification, have been shown to elicit fewer hypersensitivity\r\nreactions than whole IgG antivenom. Acute hypersensitivity reactions\r\nto antivenom are generally not life-threatening but may\r\naffect the rate or amount of antivenom administered. Previous\r\nstudies of pediatric patients aged 0–13 identified only one acute\r\nhypersensitivity reaction to Fab antivenom. We analyzed 197\r\npediatric rattlesnake envenomations who received Fab AV or\r\nF(ab’)2 AV to determine incidence and characteristics of acute\r\nhypersensitivity reactions to currently available crotaline\r\nantivenoms.\r\nMethods: This is a retrospective chart review of patients aged\r\n0–13 years diagnosed with rattlesnake envenomation and treated\r\nwith Fab AV or F(ab’)2 AV between January 2001 and December\r\n2020.
