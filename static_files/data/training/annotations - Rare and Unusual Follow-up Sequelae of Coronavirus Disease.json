Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with adverse outcomes in\ntransplantation communities. Mucormycosis, although a rare infection, has been classically\nlinked to organ transplantation and is associated with exceptionally high morbidity and mortality\nrates. In this pandemic era, the double infection of mucormycosis and COVID-19 is a lethal combination but is rarely described in the literature on organ transplantation.\nCase presentation. This article presents the case of a young kidney transplant recipient with\ndiabetes who acquired severe COVID-19, followed by disseminated mucormycosis. The patient\nwas a health care worker who developed severe COVID-19, for which he received remdesivir,\nanticoagulation, and dexamethasone. No immunomodulatory therapy was used. His maximum\noxygen support was bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. His sugar levels were frequently\nderanged during the stay. He developed secondary sepsis with Klebsiella, followed by nonhealing lung consolidation. He later developed pleural effusion and splenic abscess, which was\ndetected incidentally. He underwent an emergency splenectomy, the culture of which yielded\nmucormycosis. Liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg was administered. The patient deteriorated,\nand a repeat laparotomy yielded gastric perforation, with pus culture showing mucormycosis.\nThe patient died after a long hospital stay.\nConclusions. The diagnosis and management of this dual infection during the pandemic is\nextremely challenging. In this case, the unusual location of mucormycosis complicating COVID19 calls for a meticulous approach to opportunistic fungal infections in organ transplant recipients who are positive for COVID-19, especially in those patients with diabetes.\n\nO\n\nrgan transplantation is an established risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality\n[1]. Mucormycosis is well described as an opportunistic infection\nthat is exclusive to individuals who are immunosuppressed and\ntherefore more prone to the dual infection of COVID-19 and\nmucormycosis during the pandemic. COVID-19 outcomes in\norgan transplantation have been extensively reviewed, but data\nabout mucormycosis complicating the COVID-19 course are\nmajorly limited to the general population. In addition, there are\nonly a few such reports on organ transplant recipients [2,3]. The\nlogistics, diagnosis, and management of this dual infection are\nenormous, and so is the linked fatality. A multidisciplinary\napproach to the problem is required to improve the outcomes in\nsuch cases, but during the pandemic, this is a difﬁcult task to\naccomplish. Recently, the Indian subcontinent dealt with the twin\n0041-1345/20\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2021.09.010\n\n1554\n\ncrisis of mucormycosis and COVID-19 in the second wave of the\npandemic [4,5]. This article describes the case of a patient with\nsevere COVID-19 who developed disseminated mucormycosis in\nthe follow-up period. This report aims to create awareness for\nsuch COVID-19 complications among transplant physicians,\nbecause the presentation of this entity was camouﬂaged.\n\nCASE DESCRIPTION\n\nA 41-year-old man with IgA nephropathy was transplanted\n2 years previously with a brother donor and thymoglobulin\n*Address correspondence to Dr Deepak Kumar, Department of\nNephrology, Paras HMRI Hospital, Patna, Bihar, India.

He had excellent graft function (baseline\nserum creatinine of 1.01 m/dL) and was on a combination of\nsteroid 5 mg, mycophenolate 360 mg 3 times daily, and tacrolimus 0.05 mg/kg. He had developed post-transplant diabetes\nmellitus and had good glycemic control before COVID-19.\nHe was unvaccinated for COVID-19 and was admitted with\nsymptoms of fever, cough, and breathlessness and was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. The mainstay of COVID-19\ntherapy was oxygen support (bilevel positive airway pressure\nwas the highest oxygen support required), intravenous (IV)\nremdesivir, anticoagulation, and dexamethasone (8 mg once\ndaily for 5 days). His blood sugars were frequently high during\nthe stay. Laboratory markers indicated lymphopenia (300 cells/\nmm3), thrombopenia (80,000 cells/mm3), high ferritin levels\n(1239 ng/mL), high D-dimers (3400 mmol/L), high interleukin6 levels (67 ng/mL), and high C-reactive protein (102 mg/L).\nFigure 1 shows the detailed summary of the case.\nHe developed secondary sepsis, evidenced by blood culture\non day 6 of admission with Klebsiella sensitive to meropenem\nand colistin. He was discharged and had a homestay of 3 days\nbefore his readmission for persistent breathing difﬁculty. He\nhad also been maintained on IV antibiotics at home. His repeat\nchest scans during this readmission reported necrotizing left\nlobe pneumonia, for which IV colistin was added. No prophylactic antifungal was added. Fever and dyspnea persisted even\nafter appropriate antibiotics, so a chest radiography was\nrepeated, which showed large left-sided effusion along with\nsplenic abscess in concurrent abdominal sonography. He underwent emergency splenectomy, and the pus culture showed Rhizopus mucormycosis. He was started with IV liposomal\namphotericin B 5 mg/kg for mucormycosis, but he developed\nsecondary sepsis, fever, and abdominal tenderness, and so he\nwas re-explored, which showed stomach perforation and pus\ndrainage of around 500 mL. He died 2 days after surgery. The\npus culture reported the same species of mucormycosis.\n\nimmunosuppression and diabetes are considered some possible\nreasons for this lethal combination in this case [7]. The delay\nin diagnosis also contributed to this patient’s death. But, the\nunusual location of infection was unexpected in this case, and\nsplenic mucormycosis is more difﬁcult to diagnose than rhino\ncerebral mucormycosis, which has some obvious signs and\nsymptoms. The nonremitting nature of fever in COVID-19,\ndespite good antibiotic coverage, would have prompted us to\nlook for an underlying fungal infection. Another important\npoint is that that patient was unvaccinated for COVID-19.\nThis underscores the importance of vaccination, especially for\nsuch high-risk patients. The novelty of this report is that there\nare no previously reported cases of splenic mucormycosis in a\ntransplant patient with COVID-19. The most common presentation of mucormycosis during this pandemic is rhino-orbital.\nThe unusual occurrence of mucormycosis in our report emphasizes the need for a meticulous approach in cases with persistent fever after COVID-19. We also suggest controlling sugars\nin a standardized manner, as steroids and stress from infection\nmay lead to further deranged sugars in patients with COVID19 patient. This step is important because some published literature of this dual infection lists diabetes as a comorbidity. The\nexact dosing of liposomal amphotericin B and tailoring of\nimmunosuppression in such cases is not known, but the goal\nis to maintain a balance between infection and rejection. We\nconsider older adults and patients with diabetes and severe\nCOVID-19 to be most at risk for developing this dual infection\nduring the pandemic. Therefore, we suggest screening for\nmucormycosis to all such organ transplant patients with\nCOVID-19. The screening must include symptoms such as\neye swelling, diplopia, face swelling, abdominal pain, black\ndischarge from nose or mouth, and breathlessness after discharge. We also suggest all such prone discharged patients be\nproperly informed about the danger signs of developing\nmucormycosis and look for any signs postdischarge.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nCOVID-19 outcomes in renal transplantation patients have\nbeen vastly studied, but few data exist about the dual infection\nof mucormycosis and COVID-19 in transplant patients. The\nworld has seen a surprisingly high number of this dual infection during the pandemic [6]. Multiple reasons exist for the\nsurge of mucormycosis after COVID-19, but chronic\n\nIn conclusion, mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19 is\nassociated with high morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary approach to transplant patients with post−COVID-19\nsequelae is required to avoid any undesirable consequences.\nIncreasing awareness and timely treatment are the key steps in\nmanaging this dual infection.\n\n\f1556\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Kute VB, Bhalla AK, Guleria S, Ray DS, Bahadur MM, Shingare A, et al.
