It is used as\r\na stabilizer in the COVID-19\r\nmRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech,\r\n‘Comirnaty’, and Moderna, ‘Spikevax’. A PEG-derivative\r\npolysorbate\r\n80 is used in the adenovirus vector Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine,\r\n‘Vaxzevria’.2,3 O ur a im w as t o p resent o ur e xperiences o f e valuating\r\n27 patients with systemic acute reactions to the first dose of\r\nCOVID-19\r\nvaccine plus 10 patients with suspected PEG allergy diagnosed\r\nbefore administration of the first vaccine dose. Our results\r\nindicate that a systemic acute reaction to the first dose, or to PEG or\r\nPEG derivatives, does not necessarily contraindicate a second dose\r\nof COVID-19\r\nvaccine.4,5\r\nThirty-seven\r\npatients were referred to, and evaluated at, the\r\nAllergy Center in Linköping, Sweden. The study was approved by\r\nthe Swedish Ethical Review Authority, Dnr 2021–01301.\r\nSeven\r\npatients had an acute onset systemic reaction to the first dose of\r\nCOVID-19\r\nvaccine from Oxford/AstraZeneca, Vaxzevria, one to\r\nSpikevax (Moderna) and nineteen after the Pfizer-BioNTech\r\nvaccine,\r\nComirnaty. A second dose of Comirnaty was administered in\r\n26 cases, and one patient refused to be vaccinated. Two doses of\r\nComirnaty vaccine were administered to 10 patients with previously\r\nsuspected PEG or PEG-derivative\r\nallergy (from guidelines of the\r\nSwedish Public Health Agency).\r\nAll 37 patients underwent skin prick testing according to\r\nBruusgaard-Mouritsen\r\net al6 with PEG molecular weights from\r\n300 to 20,000, poloxamer 407 and polysorbate 80 (Sigma-Aldrich,\r\nStockholm, Sweden).\r\nOne of the patients had severe anaphylaxis after the first dose\r\nat our department and was evaluated with ImmunoCAP IgE to\r\nPEG 2,000 and 10,000 (Thermo-Fisher,\r\nAllerød, Denmark, with\r\nnovel research use only tests)7 and basophil activation test (BAT)\r\nto PEG 4000, PEG 20,000, poloxamer 407 and the native vaccine\r\n(Comirnaty).8 Polysorbate 80 was also included, but the substance\r\nhad a toxic effect on all cells, which made evaluation impossible.\r\nTwenty-seven\r\npatients were referred from primary care due to\r\na systemic acute reaction after COVID-19\r\nvaccination with vaccines\r\nfrom Pfizer-BioNTech,\r\nModerna or Oxford/AstraZeneca. The reactions\r\nwere immediate (within 60 min) and systemic (Table 1). After\r\nevaluation, 26 patients were vaccinated with the second vaccine\r\ndose (Comirnaty, as Comirnaty was prioritized according to the\r\ncounty's local vaccination policy).\r\nOf these 27 patients, four had less pronounced or subjective\r\nsymptoms such as shivering, sensation of swollen tongue or throat\r\nclosure, anxiety, pruritus and dizziness (patient number 1–4/\r\nTable 1).\r\nAs anaphylactic reactions were initially suspected, epinephrine was\r\ninjected and all four were reported to the Swedish Medical Products\r\nAgency (MPA) with a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Tryptase was not\r\ntaken during these reactions. The patients were referred to us for\r\nevaluation, underwent skin prick testing with PEG and PEG derivatives\r\nand tested negative. One patient refused to be vaccinated, and\r\nthe other three received their second vaccine dose with no adverse\r\nevents.\r\nFive patients (patient number 5–9/\r\nTable 1) had an acute onset\r\nsystemic reaction with at least two different organ systems involved.\r\nThese patients were treated with epinephrine, oral antihistamine\r\nand oral steroid. Their symptoms are described in Table 1.\r\nAll patients tested negative in skin prick testing with PEG and PEG\r\nderivatives and were then vaccinated with the second vaccine dose\r\nwith no adverse reactions.\r\nPatient number 9 had an acute onset systemic reaction, clinically\r\nconsistent with anaphylaxis (Level 2 according to Brighton\r\nCollaboration and to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\r\nDisease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN)),\r\nincluding hypotension, vomiting, dizziness and decreasing saturation\r\n(from 95–96%\r\nto 91–93%).\r\nHe was treated with intramuscular\r\nepinephrine, oral antihistamine, steroid tablets and oxygen. His\r\ntryptase level (14 μg/l) was not significantly elevated above his basal\r\ntryptase (13 μg/l). He was referred to a haematologist to evaluate\r\nsuspected systemic mastocytosis, but the bone marrow biopsy\r\ndid not show any evidence of such. Skin prick testing was carried\r\nout twice as a stepwise method, and all the SPTs were negative to\r\nPEG 300 (100%), /3000 (50%), /6000 (50%), /20,000 0.01%, 0.1%,\r\n1%, 10% and 20%/ polysorbate 80 (20%)/poloxamer 407 (10%).\r\nThe SPT to the undiluted Comirnaty vaccine was negative as well.\r\nBAT showed positive results for PEG 20,000 and 4000, and for the\r\nComirnaty vaccine.

The patient\r\ndid not have any adverse reaction to the vaccination.\r\nTen further patients (patient number: 10–19/\r\nTable 1) had different\r\nacute onset systemic reactions with at least two different organ\r\nsystems involved or with swelling sensation in the upper airways.\r\nNine of these patients were treated with oral antihistamine and oral\r\nsteroids, but not with epinephrine, and were referred to us for evaluation.\r\nAll tested negative in skin prick testing with PEG and PEG\r\nderivatives and were vaccinated with the second vaccine dose with\r\nno adverse reactions.\r\nTwo of the patients (20, 21) experienced shortness of breath\r\nwithout cardiovascular or dermatological symptoms after their first\r\nvaccine dose. The symptoms were described as asthma attacks.\r\nThey used their previously prescribed short-acting\r\nbeta-agonist\r\ninhalers\r\nto good effect. After negative skin prick testing, they received\r\ntheir second vaccine dose and tolerated it.\r\nSix of the patients (patient number: 22–27/\r\nTable 1) reacted with\r\nacute onset (within 10–60\r\nmin after the first dose) skin symptoms\r\nsuch as urticaria or generalized erythema with or without pruritus\r\nwith no other objective symptoms. Their skin prick tests for PEG and\r\nPEG derivatives were negative. One patient experienced generalized\r\npruritus during skin prick testing, which did not worsen after the administration\r\nof the second vaccine dose. No severe objective symptoms\r\nwere observed; one patient got slight redness on the chest. All\r\nsix tolerated revaccination.\r\nAll patients with acute onset urticaria, pruritus and angioedema\r\nafter the first dose of the vaccine were treated with\r\n10 mg desloratadine as premedication. Patients with underlying\r\nuncontrolled asthma who experienced breathing difficulties after\r\nthe vaccination were advised to take a double dose of their regular\r\nasthma medication for a few days before the revaccination was\r\nadministered.\r\nTen patients were evaluated due to a previous severe reaction\r\nto medications, that is, injectable medicines containing PEG/\r\nPEG derivatives, which raised suspicion of a PEG/PEG-derivative\r\nallergy (patient number: 28–37/\r\nTable 2). All ten underwent skin\r\nprick testing with PEG and PEG derivatives, tested negative and\r\nwere vaccinated with the Comirnaty vaccine with no severe allergic\r\nreactions.\r\nWe did not observe any severe reactions in patients who were\r\nrevaccinated, although the symptoms after the first vaccination were\r\nconsistent with Level 2 or 3 of diagnostic certainty according to the\r\nBrighton Collaboration. This concurs with a recently published study\r\nby Wolfson et al.9 Patients with acute onset urticaria, generalized\r\nerythema and pruritus also tolerated revaccination when allergy\r\nto PEG was ruled out. Patients with suspected severe PEG or PEG-derivative\r\nallergy were successfully vaccinated as well. The Brighton\r\nCollaboration scoring system seems to overestimate the number\r\nof patients with clinically significant anaphylaxis.9 One explanation\r\nmay be that several subjective symptoms are included as minor criteria\r\nin the Brighton Collaboration scoring system. Although several\r\npatients experienced severe symptoms that were clinically consistent\r\nwith anaphylaxis, revaccination could be administered without\r\nserious adverse events. Our findings suggest that anxiety-related\r\nnon-immune\r\nfactors may explain several of the reported anaphylaxis\r\nreactions.\r\nTo end the devastating COVID-19\r\npandemic and limit mortality,\r\nas many as possible need to be safely vaccinated.10 Patients with\r\nacute onset vaccine-related\r\nsystemic reactions to the first COVID-19\r\nvaccine dose, or suspected PEG allergy, should be referred to an allergist\r\nor allergy-interested\r\nphysician. Risks and benefits should be\r\ncarefully evaluated, with skin prick tests to PEG/PEG derivatives as\r\npromising aids. If allergy to PEG/PEG derivatives is ruled out and the\r\nbenefits overweigh the risks, the first or second vaccine dose may\r\nKey Messages\r\n• Skin prick tests were negative in our patients with reported\r\nanaphylaxis to the first dose of mRNA vaccine\r\nagainst COVID-19.\r\n• Although anaphylaxis according to the Brighton\r\nCollaboration Criteria was described after the first vaccination,\r\nthe second dose was tolerated.\r\n• As anxiety-related\r\nsymptoms can mimic anaphylaxis,\r\nvaccinations in individuals with previous reactions\r\nshould be performed in a peaceful, professional setting.\r\nRESEARCH LETTER | 3\r\nTABLE 1 Evaluation of patients with severe acute reactions after Dose 1 of COVID-19\r\nvaccine\r\nNo.\r\nAge in\r\nyears Sex History of allergy\r\n1st dose of\r\nvaccine Symptoms after vaccination Time to onset Treatment\r\nSPT with\r\nPEG and\r\nPEG\r\nderivatives\r\nVaccination\r\noutcome (2nd\r\ndose): all were\r\nvaccinated\r\nwith Comirnaty\r\nvaccine\r\n1 40–50\r\nF Systemic reaction:\r\nwheezing,\r\nshaking, chills\r\nduring pollen\r\nallergen\r\nimmunotherapy\r\nComirnaty Chills, shivering, anxiety,\r\nlight-headedness\r\n20 min Epinephrine,\r\nantihistamine, oral\r\nsteroid, oxygen\r\nNegative No reaction\r\n2 30–40\r\nF Redness and skin\r\nirritation after\r\nexposure to\r\ndifferent cosmetic\r\nproducts\r\nComirnaty Inconsistent history.\r\nDizziness, nausea,\r\ngiddiness.
