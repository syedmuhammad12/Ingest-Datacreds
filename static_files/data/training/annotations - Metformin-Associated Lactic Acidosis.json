The most common\r\nside effect of this biguanide is gastrointestinal distress. However, the relatively rare\r\ncomplication of metformin associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is the most serious\r\nadverse effect of this drug, because of its substantial morbidity and mortality. Metformin\r\nis cleared from the body by tubular secretion, which may be impaired during kidney\r\ninjury. A 61-year-old man presented to hospital for confusion and abdominal pain after\r\nheavy alcohol consumption for several days. He had severe oligoanuric AKI, profound\r\nvolume depletion, an anion gap metabolic acidosis, type II lactic acidosis, and elevated\r\nmetformin level. Patient was found to have elevated serum creatinine to 14.2 (baseline\r\nat 1), potassium 6.4, bicarb 6, anion gap of 35, PH 7.01 and lactic acid 16.3. His volatile\r\ntoxic alcohol analysis was negative and CT scan did not show evidence of bowel\r\nischemia. He received aggressive volume resuscitation and isotonic bicarbonate\r\ninfusion and boluses and was admitted to MICU. Hemodialysis was immediately\r\ninitiated for a duration of 3 hours with standard blood flow and dialysate flow rates, and\r\nhe was transitioned to CVVH after this initial high efficiency HD. Within 24 hours, he\r\nwas treated with a second full HD session followed by CVVH again. By the end of day 2\r\nadmission, he started to have increased urine output and CRRT was discontinued.\r\nPatient was normotensive during the hospitalization, his lactic acid was slowly\r\ndowntrend to 2.7 after 48 hours of treatment. His metformin level found elevated to 10\r\nmcg/ml (therapeutic range is 1-2 mcg/mL). Patient was discharged from hospital after 7\r\ndays with corrected electrolytes and fully recovered renal function (creatinine 1.2). We\r\npresent a relatively rare but serious complication of a widely used medication,\r\nmetformin, â€“ MALA, which occurred in an individual with normal baseline kidney\r\nfunction in the setting of volume depletion and oligoanuric AKI. Nephrologist should\r\nconsider MALA in unexplained high level of lactic acidosis in patients using metformin.\r\nEarly initiation of hemodialysis can correct the lactic acidosis, aid with metformin\r\nclearance, and improve the clinical outcome in patients presenting with MALA in the\r\nsetting of AKI.\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\nmetformin\r\nEMTREE DRUG INDEX TERMS\r\nalcohol; bicarbonate; creatinine; electrolyte; lactic acid; potassium\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS (MAJOR FOCUS)\r\nhemodialysis; lactic acidosis\r\nEMTREE MEDICAL INDEX TERMS\r\nabdominal pain; adult; adverse drug reaction; alcohol consumption; anion gap; case\r\nreport; clinical article; clinical outcome; complication; conference abstract; creatinine\r\nblood level; dialysate; diuresis; drug therapy; flow rate; hospital discharge;\r\nRecord downloaded - Tue 9 06 07:16:07 UTC 2022 Page 3\r\nhospitalization; human; human tissue; hypovolemia; intestine ischemia; kidney\r\nfunction; kidney injury; male; metabolic acidosis; middle aged; nephrologist;\r\noutcome assessment; resuscitation; side effect; x-ray computed tomography\r\nCAS REGISTRY NUMBERS\r\nalcohol (64-17-5)\r\nbicarbonate (144-55-8, 71-52-3)\r\ncreatinine (19230-81-0, 60-27-5)\r\nlactic acid (113-21-3, 50-21-5)\r\nmetformin (1115-70-4, 657-24-9)\r\npotassium (7440-09-7)\r\nLANGUAGE OF ARTICLE\r\nEnglish\r\nLANGUAGE OF SUMMARY\r\nEnglish\r\nPUI\r\nL2017310301\r\nDOI\r\n10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.01.334\r\nFULL TEXT LINK\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2022.01.334\r\nEMBASE LINK\r\nhttps://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&id=L2017310301&from\r\n=export\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\nCopyright 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",{"entities":[[225,239,"PRIMARYSOURCECOUNTRY"],[953,961,"REPORTERGIVENAME"],[962,966,"REPORTERFAMILYNAME"],[968,1002,"REPORTERORGANIZATION"],[1004,1007,"REPORTERCOUNTRY"],[1031,1190,"LITERATUREREFERENCE"],[1201,1263,"RESULTSTESTSPROCEDURES"],[1286,1297,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1299,1318,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1320,1331,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1333,1349,"PATIENTEPISODENAME"],[1370,1398,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1400,1436,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1438,1457,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1459,1470,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1472,1505,"REACTIONMEDDRALLT"],[1517,1528,"TESTNAME"],[1530,1537,"TESTNAME"],[1539,1541,"TESTNAME"],[1543,1561,"TESTNAME"],[1563,1579,"TESTNAME"],[1581,1593,"TESTNAME"],[1595,1604,"TESTNAME"],[1606,1616,"TESTNAME"],[1618,1627,"TESTNAME"],[1629,1645,"TESTNAME"],[1647,1658,"TESTNAME"],[1660,1673,"TESTNAME"],[1691,1700,"SUSPECTPRODUCT"],[1721,1732,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1734,1753,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1755,1783,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1785,1821,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[1823,1856,"DRUGREACTIONASSES"],[2401,2412,"PATIENTONSETAGE"],[2413,2416,"PATIENTSEX"],[2417,2438,"SERIOUSNESSHOSPITALIZATION"],[2479,2504,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2537,2552,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2554,2580,"PATIENTMEDICALCOMMENT"],[2582,2613,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2644,2670,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[2726,2730,"TESTRESULT"],[2794,2798,"TESTRESULT"],[2875,2924,"TESTRESULT"],[3547,3595,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[3797,3817,"SERIOUS"],[3861,3865,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[3976,3992,"PRIMARYSOURCEREACTION"],[4091,4101,"ACTIVESUBSTANCENAME"]]}]]}
